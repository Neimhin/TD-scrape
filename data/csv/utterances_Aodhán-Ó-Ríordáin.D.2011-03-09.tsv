AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the Pensions Board is to come in that day would it not conflict with that meeting?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a privilege to have the opportunity to address this House and it would be remiss of me not to do as other Deputies have done and thank the people who put me here, the constituents of Dublin North Central who have been trying to survive without a Labour Deputy since 2002.  We can be thankful that famine is over.I never thought that when I made my maiden speech in the Dáil I would be advocating low tax or supporting a Fianna Fáil motion but these are unusual times.  Essentially, we are talking about our ability to survive as an economy.  That is what this debate is about — employment, inward investment, survival.  When we talk to our European neighbours who are putting us under pressure, or to the European Central Bank, it is very important that we make the case — which has often been made — that if the ECB had been doing its job properly, monitoring the crazy lending from European banks to our crazy banks, perhaps we would not be in our present predicament.  That is an important point to make when we deal with our European partners.  There is no evidence to suggest that any increase in our corporation tax rate would have any material effect on improving the situation in this country in terms of tax intake.  It would probably make the situation very much worse, as I believe every Member in the Chamber would agree.The point I wish to make in this debate concerns the language we use for the economic crisis in which we find ourselves.  When we talk of unemployment we tend to refer to individual citizens as "economic units" and we talk about the "economic cost" of unemployment, the €20,000 per year lost in terms of VAT foregone and money given in social welfare payments.  However, the real cost is a social cost.  The real cost is a family without a working individual in the home, a person who has nowhere to go in the morning, a family without work, a community without work and, potentially, an entire generation without work.  Until very recently, I worked in an area of the north inner city which was hit by a situation in the late 1960s and lost the very thing that kept everybody at work, as if a mining village had lost its mine.  That is what we may be looking at as a nation.  If we lost this corporation tax rate we would be like a mining village that had lost its mine.  The area I taught in never recovered from that situation and had the sense of uselessness and the lack of dignity that go with unemployment.  This has to become part of our language.We must stop using the language of economic units and economic cost of unemployment.  The loss is a social one — it is when people feel as if they have no worth.  Unfortunately, that is the situation in far too many homes.  When we trot out statistics such as 450,000 people unemployed we are really talking about everybody's aspirations, hopes and dreams.In talking about the corporation tax rate I am struck that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  Across parties we agree on this issue.  I wish to focus briefly on that point because it is for that unity of purpose everybody outside this Chamber is hoping.  All of us have been through a most bruising election campaign and have met people who are falling apart.  If we have that unity of purpose in regard to corporation tax surely we can have the same in finding solutions to the problem of unemployment and tacking the fundamental issues about which I am passionate, such as educational disadvantage, literacy and equality, and making this the kind of republic of which we can be proud.  Let this not be the last time we have a motion on an issue that has agreement across all parties.  This country is far too important to all of us for that to be the case.We all come from somewhere and represent the people who sent us here.  People often correctly deride politics, particularly today and yesterday as events come to light that we all should be ashamed of and about which we should ask questions.  If I come from anywhere, I come from Sheriff Street, where there is a little school with a big heart.  The children in that school and their future depend on issues like this corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Employment, a place in society and sense of usefulness, dreams and aspirations are far too important for any of us to let the Irish people down.  That is why the issue is so important and why I commend the motion to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not intend to go over too many points which have already been well made.  As a country, Ireland has a unique opportunity to view what is happening in the Arab states and the north African countries which have been to the forefront of media commentary and international events in the past while.  As a widely respected voice in international affairs, Ireland can comment and it is important that we make our voice known in the unfolding events.  This reminds me very much of what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s in eastern Europe, and as Deputy Costello has correctly stated, there is something of an Arab spring about what is happening in Tunisia, Egypt and now in Libya.I have no difficulty in supporting Resolution 1970 or Resolution 1973 and I am quite happy there is a UN mandate for the actions taking place.  The key word is proportionality, and everything that we are seen to support as a country should be done in a measured fashion.  There is a danger in the perception that the international community only intervenes when an oil-rich country is at stake.  If we are intent on supporting those at risk of genocide, will we always act in such a way in every country where there is such a risk?  We know that the international community has been very slow in making interventions when they were needed.In supporting Resolution 1973 the proportionality aspect is absolutely key.  We must be seen to protect those under threat and to prevent the excesses of the Gadaffi regime.  We should not be seen to support any attempt at regime change, which is not what the resolution is about.  It would be very easy for somebody with non-Western sympathies to get the idea that a force led by France, the UK, the US and others would have the intention of regime change but we do not want to support the idea.  There should be a key message from this House that proportionality is everything and the protection of those at risk of genocide is absolutely everything, although we are not into regime change or forcing our will as an international community on anybody.Russia and China are very unhappy with the implementation of this resolution, although those countries have human rights records which are nothing to shout about either.  The Arab League is now also uneasy, and a number of African nations — South Africa in particular — have issues with how the resolution has come into effect.Our history in international relations is proud and our ability to comment is without any stain of colonialism but we must be careful.  While we commend the actions of the international community, protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring nothing happens on our watch that we have influence to stop, we should ensure that everything is done with proportionality and that we are never seen to impose our will or try to influence internal matters of another country.  It is an exciting time to be involved in politics and see what people power can achieve but proportionality is key to what is happening with this resolution.Deputy Costello has already mentioned the humanitarian aid we are affording to the Libyan cause.  It is right and we should carry on with it.  We must know checks and balances exist in the system and that the claim made by British Prime Minister David Cameron can be backed up.  He argued that the action in Libya by the UK and others is legal, necessary and right.We are happy to support Resolution 1973, as I am sure other Government colleagues will.  We must consider how to move on from this and if there is an endgame.  Have we considered what will happen when the current period of conflict finishes?  Is there any potential for those who want the excesses of Gadaffi stopped to be open to an accusation that his excesses will be replaced by those of Western military forces?  The key to the issue is proportionality and how we use our international voice to ensure we make points forcibly.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is scandalous.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We dealt with this before.  He was not in favour of a blanket guarantee, as the Deputy knows.  He is the guy who rang "Morning Ireland" to show up the Deputy's lies.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to share time with Deputies Michael McCarthy, Colm Keaveney and Derek Nolan.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the recent announcement of bank reorganisation by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government.  It is widely acknowledged in this House and beyond that the Government inherited the most appalling economic mess from the previous Administration.Never before have the actions of so few hurt so many and at such a huge cost.  While many of the decisions that need to be taken in the coming months and years are unpalatable, they are absolutely necessary for the survival of the economy, our society and the State.  We need a fully functioning banking system for the economy to operate and a constant credit flow to support the small and medium enterprise sector in protecting and helping to grow employment.We must acknowledge that many citizens feel lost in this debate because we spend more time discussing banking strategies and investing in failing institutions than we do on discussing families and investing in people.  Those of us in the political sphere have spoken of little else but banking in recent years.  The survival of the banking system is linked most definitely to the survival of our society and the State.As I stated, the language of the banking debate has been, at best, unfortunate and, at worst, demeaning and dehumanising.  Individuals have been reduced to economic units.  The cost of unemployment has been calculated in terms of loss to the Exchequer in VAT receipts and the strain of social welfare payments.  People need work, employers need credit from banks and banks need to be in a position to supply credit and support families who have justifiable aspirations for themselves and those they love.For the past 11 years I have been working in the shadow of the International Financial Services Centre in the heart of the constituency of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern.  We saw at first hand the reckless political posturing and unquestioning culture that arose during the era of the Celtic tiger.  Society at the time took the view that high level bankers and developers were risk takers and winners, while those who questioned the sustainability of their practices or the political ideology that underpinned them were regarded as whingers and moaners.While the reckless practices of those based in the IFSC and elsewhere went unregulated, those who lived in its shadow or other parts of my constituency of Dublin North Central were much more likely to see the inside of a prison.  Poverty seems to be the only real crime in this country as it is the only one we are prepared to punish in any meaningful way.  If this crisis passes us by without jail time being served by those responsible, that is, those who lied, falsified and clearly and blatantly broke the law, the very security of our republic will be at stake.  How can anyone, whether a parent, teacher or community leader, convince a child that he or she lives in a fair and just society when the only ones who are seen to serve time in prison are those society has failed from day one?  It is a challenge for everyone in the House to ensure justice is seen to be done.We often talk about crime and anti-social behaviour.  The banking and fiscal crisis has unleashed the most incredible anti-social consequences on too many families up and down this land.  The need to recapitalise the banking system is a direct result of the anti-social behaviour of the Fianna Fáil Party in government, in particular, its decision to implement a blanket bank guarantee in September 2008.  The Labour Party was the only party to oppose the guarantee.While it will take time to repair the damage of the 14 years in which Fianna Fáil held power, in only three weeks the new Government has taken control of the banking system.  We have not hidden away the extent of the damage and have, for the first time since the crisis began, been brutally honest with the people.  The stress tests are the most rigorous ever carried out on the banking system.  For this reason, it is likely that we have gleaned an accurate picture of the true cost of Fianna Fáil's anti-social behaviour.The banking system will be restructured.  It will have two core pillar banks which will be constructed around the real needs of the economy.  The banks will be divested of their weakest parts — their non-core functions — over time and the fire sale losses which the European Central Bank had previously demanded will be avoided.  The new banking system will be an engine of economic growth by providing €12 billion of additional credit for businesses and households every year.  A clear-out of bank boards will focus on anyone who was a board member before 2008.The stress test requirement will be €21 billion plus €3 billion in contingency funding.  This figure will be reduced, however, by requiring banks to sell off assets and seek private investment, as well as through the imposition of burden sharing on subordinated bondholders.  This approach marks a clear break with the blank cheque policy of the past.We must have a functioning banking system, which means we must recapitalise the core of the system, albeit at a high cost.  The proposed restructuring of the banks allows the country to move forward.  We are in recovery and the restructuring is part of a recovery process.  As a society, we need to know that we will never allow this to happen again.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I note the programme for Government states that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publicly identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State. This is a clear reference to section 37 of the Equality Act. When will an amendment to that legislation come before the House so that the discriminatory practices of some schools can be outlawed?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the opportunity to speak on suicide prevention.  Members on all sides of the House made many excellent contributions on the issue and I will endeavour not to repeat points which were previously raised.  I will focus on younger children, how this society is failing to protect their mental health and what we must change to ensure we intervene at the earliest opportunity to protect the most vulnerable.This country has returned to the days of high unemployment, mass emigration and social despair.  The most tragic by-product is the increasing rate of suicide.  This tragedy is not confined to any particular class or corner of the island but is affecting rich and poor, old and young, male and female.  In 2009, the rate of people taking their own lives increased by a startling 24%.  These are people who see no way out of the despair they feel, whether because of negative equity, addiction issues, unemployment, discrimination or depression.  They took their lives because they could see no hope for their future.We can address this national emergency by creating a better society that provides people with the best of services, education, social protection and health care.  However, what about the children who are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and are growing up in households ridden by despair?  They are fragile, impressionable, easily corruptible and can be permanently damaged by the environment in which they live.  What interventions are available to us to care for delicate minds or childhoods filled with nights in which heated words are exchanged by financially crucified adults so close to the brink that they see no way out?What about children who live in areas where the only viable economic activity is the drugs trade?  Older siblings get sucked into a hopeless spiral of street corner loitering and low-level anti-social behaviour and often on to full-scale membership of violent gangs, incentivised by easy money, street credibility and a perverse sense of empowerment.  Communities such as these are rarely understood, chronically under resourced and frequently stigmatised with outlandish generalisations by media outlets.  If we accept that it takes a village to raise a child, is it any wonder that children of such a village will grow up with a poor sense of self-esteem, negative self-image and feel totally disempowered and disconnected from the mainstream of Irish society?Our education system is charged with the responsibility of identifying, diagnosing and treating children who display a variety of emotional behaviour disorders.  As currently constituted, the system outrageously misplaces resources in a manner that inevitably benefits children from middle-income backgrounds and not those more in need.  Our education supports for those most in need of help are misplaced and poorly structured.This happens in two main ways.  First, the allocation of resource teachers is based on the general allocation model introduced by the previous Government, which allocates teachers on the basis of the school enrolment number and not on the basis of need.  As a result, children who attend schools with a smaller enrolment do not receive the same level of support irrespective of the level of need.  This is a crude, blunt and indeed cruel arrangement that must be amended to ensure that our most vulnerable children are supported.Second, in the allocation of resource hours sanctioned by the special educational needs organiser, SENO, schools with access to private psychological or clinical assessments receive more resource hours.  Those who depend solely on the under-resourced National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, receive fewer.  School leaders, teachers and school principals are left in an almost impossible position when attempting to provide supports for children who present with specialised care needs.  They have to juggle referral forms and representations to the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, NEPS, agencies such as the Mater Child Guidance Clinic, the relevant social worker, the home school community liaison service and, if they are fortunate, supportive parents.  I have been the principal on the telephone to agencies being told that the child is not suicidal and that I am wasting my time.If a parent or parents prove obstructive or difficult, the school is powerless to proceed.  This is just one more glaring example of why our children's rights referendum is so sorely needed.  Our children now live in a society that is at breaking point, in a culture that shortens childhood to maximise corporate profit, in a country that purports to cherish every child equally, but only punishes our vulnerable rather than liberating them.  We must liberate our children from the dark clouds that hang over their minds.  We must empower them with the ability to express their feelings, to understand their circumstances and encourage them to believe that they truly are more powerful than they could ever contemplate.We cannot fail them at the earliest stage, the stage when they depend on us the most.  The risk of internalising the hurt permanently is too great, and the potential of becoming another suicide statistic too real.

Uaireanta an t-aon am go n-úsáidtear an Ghaeilge sa Teach seo ná nuair atáimid ag labhairt faoin Ghaeilge.  Cuireann sin as do dhaoine, ba chóir bheith in ann labhairt faoi chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na tíre, faoi chúrsaí turasóireachta agus spóirt trí Ghaeilge, ní hamháin faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge.Ní ghlacaim leis an méid a dúirt sé, áfach, faoi fanatical elements.  Tá fanatical elements i gceist nuair atáimid ag caint faoin Ghaeilge agus cuireann sin as do dhaoine nach féidir tuairim faoi leith a bheith ag duine faoin Ghaeilge toisc chomh láidir is atá na tuairimí ag daoine áirithe faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge.Tá áthas an domhain orm an seans a fháil labhairt ar thodhchaí na Gaeilge agus ar bheartas an Rialtais maidir le dul chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Beidh mé ag labhairt i mBéarla chomh maith ar ball beag.Glacaim go bhfuil gach duine sa Teach ar aon tuairim faoi dhul chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Táimid ar aon intinn gurbh fhearr linn ar fad go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó daoine in ann í a labhairt agus sásta í a labhairt.  Tá daoine in ann Gaeilge a labhairt nach bhfuil sásta sin a dhéanamh agus tá daoine eile ann nach bhfuil in ann í a labhairt ar chor ar bith.  Cé nár aontaigh mé le seasamh pháirtí Fhine Gael roimh an olltoghchán maidir le stádas éigeantach na Gaeilge mar ábhar meánscoile, b'fhiú an díospóireacht a bhí againn.  Don chéad uair le blianta fada anuas, bhí stádas na Gaeilge ina cheist ar na doirse agus sinn i mbun toghchánaíochta.Molaim na gealltanais ó thaobh na Gaeilge mar a leagtar amach sa chlár Rialtais, go bhfuil sé mar aidhm againn an méid daltaí a dhéanann Gaeilge san ardteistiméireacht mar ábhar onórach a mhéadú agus go bhfuil sé mar aidhm 50% de na marcanna san ardteistiméireacht a thabhairt don bhéaltriail.  Níl ciall ar bith ann, áfach, béim chomh mór sin a chur ar an mbéaltriail san ardteistiméireacht gan bhéaltriail ar bith a bheith ann sa teastas sóisearch.  Tá 14 bliain ann go dtí go gcaithfidh dalta Gaeilge a labhairt go foirmeálta os comhair cigire.Cé go bhfuil céim agam sa Ghaeilge, agus cé go labhraím Gaeilge gach lá, chaith mé níos mó ná deich mbliana i scoil faoi mhíbhuntaiste i lár chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus tá sé go ríshoiléir dom nach bhfuil ár bpolasaí ó thaobh múineadh na Gaeilge ag feidhmiú sna scoileanna.  Tá drochmheas ag cuid mhaith daltaí, agus tuismitheoirí fiú, maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge.  Ní hamháin sin, ach i gcásanna áirithe, níl sa Ghaeilge ach constaic dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh áit a bhaint in aon cheann de na coláistí múinteoireachta.  Tá an baol ann anois, cé go nglacaim leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Dessie Ellis, nach bhfuil i gceist leis an Ghaeilge ach caitheamh aimsire don mheán-aicme i gceantair ina bhfuil Gaelscoileanna lonnaithe agus ina bhfuil dóthain airgid ann chun daltaí a chur chun na Gaeltachta le linn an tsamhraidh nó fiú ranganna breise a chur ar fáil dá bpáistí.  An important issue regarding the future of the Irish language is that it could be perceived to be the pursuit of the middle classes.  I refer to those who have resources available to send their children to the Gaeltacht in the summer or to purchase grinds.  I refer to those who live in areas that have gaelscoileanna, which unfortunately in some cases have managed to attract parents who, to be blunt, are suffering from a case of white fright and are using the Irish language as a means of having their children in a monocultural setting in school.  This issue has arisen in certain parts of this city and country.Having taught in an area of disadvantage for the past 11 years, I have come across many wonderful children who would make wonderful teachers.  However, the Irish language is becoming a barrier to them becoming teachers because of the insistence of the Department of Education and Skills or, more importantly of the third level institutions, that is, the teacher training colleges, that one must have an honour in Irish in the leaving certificate examination to become a primary school teacher.  There is no reason to exclude any student who shows ability or creativity or who wishes to become a primary teacher, having acquired the requisite points and having been identified as someone who would be an excellent teacher at either primary or secondary level but the former in particular.  There is no reason we cannot find a mechanism by which such people could enter into third level teaching colleges and acquire their Irish language qualification whilst there.  I conclude by making a point about which I feel strongly, namely, that if the Irish language is being used as a mechanism to prevent those from certain backgrounds to advance their education, become teachers or to change the way in which education is delivered in schools, it then is becoming destructive in the education system.Tá an cheist seo tábhachtach domsa agus do roinnt daoine eile sa Teach, ach tá an pointe deireanach rí-thábhachtach chomh maith.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Not true.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it 60 or 65 Members Deputy Martin is missing?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter.I first refer to the commitment given in the programme for Government, which states: "We will initiate a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland to improve its functioning in the light of changing circumstances."  Serious concerns and questions have been raised about alleged abuses of power, misgovernance and misuse of financial resources in the Irish Red Cross Society for over 20 years, yet the State unquestioningly gives it an annual grant of nearly €1 million.  The OPW also provides the IRC with its head office at 16 Merrion Square effectively free of charge.  In comparison, the budget of Irish Aid has been cut by 8% since late 2008, while the IRC has suffered no cut whatsoever.Concerns about misuse of power and financial irregularities in the IRC have been raised by staff, board members, media and politicians for over 20 years.  There was a surge in revelations in 2009 and 2010 following an intensive media campaign and the decision by Noel Wardick, former head of the international department at the IRC, to go public with his concerns.  Mr. Wardick spent four years trying to have the matters addressed internally — all, unfortunately, to no avail.  Mr. Wardick was fired for gross misconduct in November 2010 under the charge of breaking his confidentiality agreement.  This is yet another example of an employee reporting serious concerns in good faith and in the public interest and suffering serious employer reprisal.  Seven months later, Mr. Wardick remains unemployed.  Transparency International Ireland has called for whistleblowing legislation to include provisions allowing for criminal prosecutions to be taken against employers who take retaliatory action against whistleblowers who report the truth in good faith.  It would have been easier for Mr. Wardick to remain silent.In the past, the Government has always taken a hands-off approach to questions raised about the integrity of IRC actions, despite appointing its chairman and 16 members of its central council and despite the presence of a Department of Defence official on the IRC governing executive committee.  It appears that Governments have been happy to involve themselves in absolutely every aspect of IRC operations except those relating to governance reform, financial irregularities and abuse of power.The Minster will be aware of the scandal regarding the undeclared Tipperary bank account which was found to have €162,000 intended for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami lying in it for over three years.  The organisation's vice chairman was a signatory on the account.  The matter was swept under the carpet despite the resignation of the then honorary secretary in protest over the society's failure to investigate the matter.  She formally wrote to the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and was effectively ignored.  An internal investigation was carried out in late 2010 but despite the identification of major breaches of financial policy and certain actions deemed as "a threat to IRC governance", no one was held to account or blamed.  Nothing has changed.  The signatory on the aforementioned account, the society's vice chairman, Tony Lawlor, was re-appointed as vice chairman in May 2011 for the 21st year in a row.  The treasurer, Ted Noonan, who failed to investigate the matter at the time, was re-appointed in May this year to the board for the tenth year running.The IRC made substantial operating losses in 2008 and 2009.  It broke even in 2010 only because more than €600,000 intended for Haiti was recorded as domestic income.  This is a practice that has apparently gone on for years within the IRC and is morally reprehensible.  In reality, the society made a large operational loss in 2010, yet it still managed to pay its secretary general €165,000 and spend €140,000 on legal fees in trying to silence Mr. Wardick, including legal suits against Google and UPC.Any independent examination of media reports, industrial relations hearings and parliamentary questions over the past 20 years will bear out the fact that the IRC is a highly dysfunctional organisation with real and serious questions to answer about its financial affairs.  Since 2007, the IRC has had four secretaries general, which is a clear sign of the problems that remain unresolved in the society.The so-called new IRC constitution is also deeply flawed and is designed to ensure those in power remain in power for many years to come.  I believe there was minimal organisation-wide consultation on its drafting and it must not be approved by the Government or enshrined in legislation without significant amendment.  The Minister has said he is in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to the legal review, as outlined in the programme for Government.  There is a real worry that the Minister will use the new legislation to enshrine the new IRC constitution into law, which will in effect secure the power bases of the long-serving, discredited incumbents, which is exactly what they are hoping for.The IRC is not obliged to report separately, in financial or narrative form, on its €1 million Government grant.  It appears as a one-line income and expenditure item in its audited accounts.  The Government basically gives the grant annually to the IRC and thereafter washes its hands of its responsibilities.  Based on the evidence to date, all the information now in the public domain and the real concerns that exist inside and outside this House, the Minister must seriously consider withholding the annual grant of €1 million and review its donation of free property to the IRC for use as its headquarters until such time as a comprehensive independent investigation into the society takes place and is concluded.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sinn Féin is making a mockery of the House.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister's launch last Friday of a national literacy strategy, which will have a major impact on efforts to tackle educational disadvantage.  In other jurisdictions they discuss eliminating and the total eradication of illiteracy.  That is the type of language one must use in this country.  I feel very passionately, having worked in an area of disadvantage for the past 11 years, that education is the great liberator and the overarching approach of the Department of Education and Skills and this Government must be the elimination of illiteracy and educational disadvantage.  I know the special needs assistant, SNA, issue inside out.  I know, as Deputy Dowds has said, that there were schools in certain areas of the State that were able to buy resources.  Where a school has access to private psychological assessments while another is dependent on the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, inevitably what happens is that resources are applied to the school that can buy them and which has access to private assessments while the school, such as the one I taught in, that is dependent on NEPS does not get the same resources.  That is an issue.  The system has been allowed to go out of all control.  No one on this side of the House wants to be in a position where we must defend a cap or talk to SNAs or people who work in schools or their representatives, as I did today.  The reality is that if we are trying to target resources at those who need them most, the SNA system has failed in that regard.Another system that has failed is the general allocation model of special needs hours.  I have said a thousand times and have said for the past seven weeks that the general allocation model benefits advantaged children over disadvantaged children because 50% of the resource hours are allocated by the State through the general allocation model which is based on the number of children in a school, not on need.  The child in a school of 1,000 students is much more likely to get resource hours than a child in a disadvantaged primary school of 100 children.  The system is not working because it is not targeted at those who are most in need assistance.  We cannot have an overly emotive view of the SNA and resource hours system without properly analysing whether we are making a real impact in the lives of those who need assistance the most.  I have been saying this for years and this is not a political football because we are talking about the children and their needs.  I met a delegation from IMPACT and they made some very sensible proposals.  I will bring these to the Minister this week and I hope we will be able to get some feedback from him on them.I wish to comment on making this issue a political football.  I think we must be a bit more sensitive about the way we describe each other in this Chamber.  Last night somebody in this Chamber called me a hypocrite on this issue.  "The Last Word" show with Matt Cooper is still waiting for a return phone call from Deputy Finian McGrath on a debate that I was due to have with him at 6.10 p.m. on Today FM.  They are still waiting; the Deputy could not be found.  I was ready and willing to debate this issue.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to discuss the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on water leakage.  I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Wallace.I do not intend to spend much time on this.  In effect, the report suggested that in regard to water leakage, Ireland appears to have twice the OECD average of unaccounted-for water.  It stated that overall the average percentage of unaccounted-for water was approximately 41.48% in 2009, a marginal increase on the 2008 figure of 41.2%.I am a great believer in the levering of local charges and believe that local authorities should have the authority so to do.  I am a tax and spend kind of guy.  If one believes in public services, as I do, someone has to pay for them.  I have no issue with the water charge per se.  However, it would be very difficult for us as Deputies working in local areas or as national politicians to convince the public that a water levy or charge or water metering can be justified when the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report indicates such a level of unaccounted-for water.Various regions have issues with their water supply.  We are well aware, as will be the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, about the issues in Galway city.  Deputy Michael McNamara assures me that issues relating to the water supply in Ennis are as bad as they ever were.  In my constituency there have been ongoing water pressure issues in the Killester-Donnycarney area.It is imperative for us to convince those who will be charged this levy that finances accrued from it will be put back into the water system in order that they may have confidence in it.  I do not find it reasonable that anyone should expect we can front-load that investment before such a levy is in place, but we must ensure the public sees the connection between the charge and the improvement in the service.  If one lives in an area where, as has happened in recent years, there have been annual major water shortages because of the poor water infrastructure in the city, or if one lives in an area where cryptosporidium dances through one's tap on a regular basis, or there is discoloration or whatever, it is very difficult for a public representative to make that connection, especially when people see figures such as these.  We must convince the public that we can ring-fence these moneys for the improvement of the water service.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will comment only briefly because I took up so much of Deputy Wallace's time.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I still maintain that a large-scale engagement with the public is needed to make the connection between the charge and the investment necessary for solving the displacement problem.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise a local issue, namely the proposed Clontarf flood barrier, which will have a citywide impact.In September 2005, Dublin City Council's Clontarf promenade steering committee considered different options for the flood defence-arterial water main works and chose option 5, comprising walls and bunds containing water mains.  No public representatives, residents' groups or business groups were represented on this committee.  However, the environmental impact statement, EIS, states the main stakeholders were present.  The minutes of the meeting indicate that council officials realised, even at that point, the need to provide clear images and drawings for the public consultation process.  This recommendation was not pursued, however.A consultation evening was held in St. Anthony's Parish Church in Clontarf on 12 June 2006 to deal with the scope of the information to be included in the EIS.  Residents' groups were invited to the meeting.  According to a council e-mail of Tuesday, 11 October 2006, the public consultation process on the flood defences-arterial water mains did not commence until 3 December 2007.  Accordingly, this meeting cannot be considered to have been part of that process.  Indeed, the EIS had not even been completed at that stage.In November 2007, all residents' groups were written to informing them that Dublin City Council was about to apply to An Bord Pleanála for planning permission through the submission of an EIS, as yet unseen by residents, businesses or local representatives.  The letter also informed them a period of public consultation would take place and that full details of the project would be on public display for eight weeks in Dublin City Council's civic office, Marino Library, none of which are in the Clontarf area itself, and on the council's website.  On 3 December 2007, this submission and public consultation was further advertised in the Irish Independent and this date was the commencement of the public consultation period.One day later, on 4 December 2007, Dublin City Council applied to An Bord Pleanála for permission for the works as outlined in the EIS and first advertised to the public one day previously.  Subsequently, in July 2008 planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála.There is no evidence of any involvement of either public representatives, residents or local businesses, prior to a decision being made in September 2005, that the preferred option for the works was for bunds-walls rather than four other options under consideration.  Although the council has accepted the height recommendation changed after plans were first presented to local councillors in 2006, this was not communicated and no supplemental presentation was made detailing the alterations or the reasons held by the council for departing from the original proposal.  Prior to the planning application being made to An Bord Pleanála in December 2007, no public representatives or residents groups had sight of a completed environmental impact statement, EIS, or had an opportunity to provide feedback or comment on it.  The EIS was made available on 3 December — the application was made to An Bord Pleanála on 4 December.  As a result, the only opportunity these stakeholders had to make an input into the process was that afforded them by the An Bord Pleanála system at a cost of €50.  Although the EIS was made available after the application had been made to An Bord Pleanála, it was never available at any public location in Clontarf.  My point is that the process was deficient from the beginning.I wish to bring the Minister of State's attention to another matter.  The development is in close proximity to a number of special protection areas and a special area of conservation, namely, north Dublin Bay.  I direct the Minister of State to Article 6(3) of the habitats directive and the guidance provided by the Commission, those being, EC (2000), EC (2002) and EC (2006).  Any plan or project that may have a significant effect on a special area of conservation shall be subject to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objectives.  This appropriate assessment should include, where appropriate, obtaining the opinion of the general public and must comply with the requirements as set forth by the directive and clarified by the Commission's guidance notes and the European Court of Justice, ECJ, cases C-127/02 and C-418/04.The EIS on the works in question does not comply with the requirements of the directive and relevant explanatory documents, since no appropriate assessment was undertaken.  In taking the decision under An Bord Pleanála reference 29N.JA0008, the competent authority — Dublin City Council — has failed to take account of the appropriate assessment of the implications of the development for the designated Natura 2000 site in light of the site's conservation objectives and has not made certain that the development will not affect the integrity of the site.Like the council, will the Minister of State accept that the consultation process was deficient?  Will he accept the documentation that I will provide him for his officials to examine?  Will his officials examine the relevant European legislation and the ECJ cases I have outlined?  I will be as quick as possible in the four minutes allowed to me.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will the Minister of State engage with the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, to ensure that the question of these works proceeding or not proceeding in the immediate future will not have a negative impact on householders on the Clontarf promenade?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply, although the matters it addressed differed from those that I raised.  Will he accept the documentation?  If I forward it to his Department, will he ask his officials to investigate under section 21 of the Planning and Development Act on An Bord Pleanála whether every statutory box was ticked in respect of the consultation process?  Will his office also take into consideration the European legislation to which I referred?  I will forward it to his office and to other Ministers with responsibility in this regard.  Will the Minister of State take into consideration the insurance implications of these works going ahead or not going ahead and engage with the IIF?  If his office commits to doing so, it would provide solace to the residents and wider community affected.  These are three simple suggestions and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Not for Clontarf; it was a different ward.  Deputy McGrath represented the area, though.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That would have made a great submission to An Bord Pleanála.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Thank you.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Take them all together.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be brief.  I share the anger expressed already and also express my condolences to the families who have lost family members.  I will limit my comments to the emergency relief fund and its potential.  I understand the complications that might be involved in who oversees and administers it.  Ultimately, that is a decision for the Government.I ask the Ministers to focus on the central issue that most concerns me for the future, house insurance.  Deputy Finian McGrath and I were in Donnycarney this morning.  I was in Clontarf last night and residents in Artane were on the telephone to me all day today.  Since the Wad River has burst its banks on previous occasions the insurance companies are now refusing to insure homes in the Donnycarney area.  Those houses are de facto worthless.  One cannot sell one’s house if one cannot get home insurance because a potential buyer cannot get a mortgage if they cannot get house insurance.  The houses are worthless and the owners are liable for all the work that must be undertaken in those homes.  Families not only have the emotional trauma of having to move out for the couple of months required to fix things again, but there is also the huge financial heartache.The city council has let them down time after time.  Although moneys have been provided by the previous Government and this Government for the works to be undertaken, people are still waiting for those works to be carried out.  Meanwhile, they are left exposed to the elements.  Today, women, children and families are in floods of tears because now they must bear the financial cost.  I have a direct question for the Minister.  Those families are financially liable because, through no fault of theirs, they have no home insurance.  They have been left high and dry by the insurance companies.  Can we find a mechanism to support them at this time?  They must keep an eye on the skies every day of their lives until the next flood, which is inevitably only months away unless those essential works are carried out.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the very same issue, I understand National Irish Bank is owned by Danske Bank and that it does not have to adhere to ECB guidelines because it is Danish owned and Denmark is not in the eurozone.  However, as Deputy Adams quite rightly stated, it intends to increase its variable mortgage interest rate by 0.95% this Friday.  If legislation comes before the House in this regard, what can we do to ensure interest rate increases of such institutions, which work within our marketplace, will not have a huge impact on families across the State?  What can we do with institutions that are foreign owned and outside the remit of the ECB?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to raise the matter of the horse and greyhound fund in the context of overall sports funding and promised legislation on online gambling.  Approximately €30 million a year is raised through a levy on gambling in Ireland.  Regardless of what one's bet is placed on, the levy goes directly to the horse and greyhound fund under the terms of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  This is despite the fact that only 10% of bets placed relate to these two industries.  A total of 80% of the fund goes to the horse racing industry and the vast bulk of this is spent on prize money.  The prize money on offer in the Republic of Ireland is 60% higher than that in the UK.  Also, the chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland received a pre-tax bonus of €57,000 in 2009.This year, Irish Sports Council funding amounts to €25.6 million for 57 national governing bodies, 32 local sports partnerships and 18 high performance sports.  Given our sporting endeavour, next year's Olympic Games and the fact we all enjoy sports so much, one could argue that in the current recession sport is one of the only things keeping communities alive.  It keeps children occupied and families entertained and gives us all a lift.  This Friday, everybody's eyes will be turned towards Tallinn hoping the Irish soccer team can go halfway towards qualifying for the European Championships.The Minister for Justice and Equality indicated a levy on online betting will be introduced in spring next year.  We believe this could raise approximately €90 million.  Can I have a commitment that it will be spent on sports funding?  Does the Minister intend to investigate the current funding criteria for the horse and greyhound industry?  Has he asked the industry for indications of how the money is spent?  Everyone accepts that the horse racing and greyhound industries are of great benefit, are fantastic employers and act as wonderful tourism magnets.  At the same time, can we justify a situation where the vast bulk of the funding goes to prize money and the money spent on prize money is 60% higher here than in UK?  I also referred to the figures on bonuses for the chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland.There is inequity in sports funding, with €25 million going to the Sports Council, which looks after so many national governing bodies, local sports partnerships and high performance sports.  At the Olympic Games next year we will talk about the performance of our athletes, how they are funded and how well they have performed.  Is it justifiable that €25 million of our taxpayers' money goes to that while €30 million of taxpayers' money goes to the horse and greyhound industry?  Is it justifiable that 100% of the levy raised on betting in this country goes to an industry when only 10% of the bets placed relate to that industry?  If Paddy and Joe put €5 on Manchester United versus Chelsea, the levy raised on the €5 bet goes to the horse and greyhound industry.Will the proposed levy on online gambling be funnelled back into the sports industry?  Can we be assured it will not go in the same manner to the horse and greyhound industry and that it will be more equitably distributed?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A cross-departmental response is required.  What is the Minister's instinct in respect of the equity of sports funding?  The Minister's response shows that €57 million has been provided this year for the horseracing and greyhound fund.  No one wants to question the justification of funding for that industry, which is a wonderful industry and one Ireland is famous for.  However, how does the Minister square giving €57 million to that industry in the current crisis, in view of the prize fund amounts, with the €25 million given to the Sports Council, which looks after 57 national governing bodies, 32 local sports partnerships and 18 high performing sports?  Does the Minister accept there is an anomaly and will he commit to investigating a way in which we can address it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Why is the IMF still here?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It would be politically easy to storm in here and make party political judgements on the sentiment behind the Bill.  I do not think the House or Bill deserves that.I appreciate the tone used by Deputy Dooley in trying to be constructive, and referring to the past and future and what we can achieve together.  Any new Member of the House will realise it is not in any way reflective of Ireland.  It is almost exclusively white, very middle-class and 13% female.  There is a question mark over corporate donations, money and who does and does not get into power.I spent five years as a political representative in the north inner city and 11 years teaching in the area.  There is a question mark over who has power and who has the power to influence power.  Unfortunately we all accept that sometimes money talks and those from a particular financial background do not feel they have a stake in the political system.  Their participation rates, turnout in elections and level of voter registration are lower.  There is a perception that if one does not have financial purse strings one does not have influence on the political system.  The Bill enables us to have a good look at the heart of Irish politics and consider how we can move on.  We have had a sordid past and there has been a perception of influence over politics.  We have had problems, not just in terms of shady brown envelope dealings and backroom meetings.  Legislation has been passed in this House which had legitimate objectives and enjoyed the support of various political parties.  For example, the Part V provision of the Planning and Development Act 2000, whereby 20% of all new developments would be set aside for social or affordable housing, was broadly welcomed.  However, because of the undue influence of a particular interest group, that provision was watered down, with nine different ways introduced to allow developers to side-step their obligation.  During the boom many of us on local authorities, who struggled to accommodate people on the incredibly lengthy housing lists, were left with a gut feeling that particular vested interests were wielding an undue influence on the political system to such an extent that they were able to change the Minister's view on how social housing would be provided.  As a result, most of the most vulnerable people in society did not have their housing needs met.We must consider why political parties need money and to what end that money is spent.  Reference was made to postering, leafleting and so on.  How is a person without the required financial capacity supposed to compete in that game?  Elections are games in the sense that it is all about how many posters one erects, how many leaflets one distributes, how many fund-raisers one holds and how much one is willing to invest in a campaign.  Interestingly, in the recent presidential election the candidate who was topping the polls for a good deal of the campaign did not use any posters.  This gave pause for many of us to reconsider the validity and effectiveness of postering.What is at issue here is access to the democratic process.  In many ways, Irish politics is fundamentally broken.  I am a former teacher and I count people from many professions among my parliamentary colleagues.  It is amazing to observe the difference in how one is perceived as soon as one enters politics.  When one is working in a community or in a school, nobody second guesses one's bona fides or motivation for taking a particular stance.  However, as soon as one stands for election or becomes involved in a political campaign, one's motivations are consistently and constantly questioned.  Any position one adopts is liable to be dismissed as a means of winning votes, as only being taken because somebody has given one something or one is trying to defend this or that vested interest.  It is difficult to argue against that attitude in the context of the donation system as it currently stands.Reference has been made to the subscriptions the Labour Party receives from trade unions.  If we are to have a proper system of financing of the political system, all parties must play their part.  As such, I would be happy to see an end to the connection between my party and the trade union movement.  However, as Deputy Eamonn Maloney observed, there is a great difference between a trade union making donations to a party in the hope it will protect the rights of workers and a corporation doing the same with the objective of safeguarding its right to make profit.  There is a fundamental difference in that.  Nevertheless, if we have a situation where people are, even for a moment, second guessing politicians' bona fides in respect of their policy or legislative positions and suspecting they are owned by any vested interest, then there is a need for change.  Therefore, I agree that the donations the Labour Party receives from the various trade unions — although they amount to only a small percentage of our income — should be ended, if that would help the political process.We must be constructive in our approach to this issue.  There is much talk at present of creating a new republic, ensuring every citizen has a stake in the country, reassuring people that they have political representatives who will defend them and reflect their concerns, and inspiring confidence in people that they have as much say through the ballot box as anybody else.  In this regard, I am confident that the legislation we bring forward will iron out any flaws in the Bill and offer a constructive way forward.  This must be part of a process and we must all go through it together.  When presented with a Fianna Fáil Bill on corporate donations, there is an instinctive and easy temptation to dredge up the past and engage in a party political muzzling exercise.  However, that does nobody any favours, either Members of this House or the people who have put us in here to clean up the political process.It is time to accept the bona fides of Members on all sides of the House on the question of how we can change politics.  There has been some suggestion that this debate is merely a tokenistic gesture, and I understand why some may be of that view.  However, that we are here on a Friday says something about how things have changed.  We must take a different approach to our engagement with these important issues.  If there is a willingness across the political spectrum, from Members of all parties and none — Independent Deputies have argued strongly that they find it far more difficult to engage in the political system — then we might get somewhere.  We must ensure that people feel they have a stake in the political system, that their vote counts and that it is as valid and has as much power as that of the person with a large cheque book.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Tax breaks for developers, that is what Fianna Fáil put in place.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Fianna Fáil made it an art form.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the sentiments in the motion.  However, it would be remiss of me not to mention my uncle, Micheál Ó Ríordáin, whom I buried earlier.  He was proud of my achievement in being elected to the House in February.  He had campaigned with me since my first election.  I reflected earlier as we sat in the church about the life chance he had been given by this Republic.  He moved out of the tenement house in which he was brought up to a corporation estate in the 1940s.  The Republic owes a life chance to every child, regardless of who they are, where they are from, their religion, the colour of their skin or the income bracket of their parents.It keeps me awake at night — I am sure this is shared by others — that if we do nothing in the next number of years we will take away the life chance from our children because they had the misfortune to be born over the past few years or in the coming years.  We need to change the language we use to describe the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I find it offensive that people constantly state that people who are unemployed are costing the Exchequer €20,000 a year and they are a supposed drain on the social protection budget.  This is a societal cost, not an economic cost.  The impact losing a job and being unable to go to work has on an individual and, by extension, on his or her children is immeasurable.  It should not be measured in economic units.I am proud to be a member of the Government because of the some of the initiatives we have taken.  The reversal of the cut in the national minimum wage was not easy and it has not resulted in a huge change but we said we would do it.  We are determined to defend the Croke Park agreement because it defends the rights of low paid public servants.  Many Members have different views on the joint labour committee system but when we were targeted by representatives of the conservative Catholic right who suggested that members of my party and other parties were in some way anti-Catholic, I wish they had been so vociferous when we protected the rights of those who worked on a Sunday, the traditional day of rest, because they had to work to put bread on the table for their children, and ensured they would be compensated for giving up their Sundays.  Commentators on the conservative Catholic right were silent on that issue, which has had more of an impact on the family unit than any of the other stuff they go on with.  Poverty has the biggest impact on the family and I wish they would realise that.I appreciate the motion and I welcome the opportunity to discuss matters relating to children.  We are trying to correct the mistakes made in respect of our economy.  There is only one chance to be a child.  Unlike my uncle, Michéal, and my father, many children do not get the opportunity to fulfil their potential.  The social welfare system does not, in many respects, act as an enabler.  In many circumstances, it almost acts as a cage.  Everyone knows a cage will protect one from the wolves.  However, it does not enable a person or set him free.  In the context of what we are trying to deliver in respect of the education budget, one of the things of which I am extremely proud is the literacy strategy.  We are determined to push that strategy forward because if one cannot read, one cannot play a full role in society.People must take the totality of what the Government is doing into account when discussing the possibility of maximising children's potential.  As already stated, people only get one chance at childhood.  It is not a person's fault if he or she happens to be born in the middle of an economic crisis.  That fact must be taken into consideration when discussing the concerns raised in the motion.  I wish that every child could have the opportunity to grasp the life chances of which my uncle, Michéal, managed to avail, to live the kind of life he lived and to maximise their potential.  This is why I hope that next week we will be able to stand up and be proud of the direction the Government proposes to take.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On two proposals that were made outside this House, when will the proposed legislation on mandatory reporting of child abuse come before the House?  On the question of two referenda, one on the future of the Seanad and the other on children's rights, will those two referenda take place outside the remit of the proposed constitutional convention?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is an issue that I know the Minister feels strongly about, and she has previously answered parliamentary questions from me about it.  What we are talking about is a commercial attack on childhood.  Childhood is becoming much shorter, and this is for the purpose of commercial profit.  I am aware of the phenomenon of little girls coming to school with pencil cases with Playboy logos on them in a deliberate attempt by certain commercial interests to normalise pornography.  The Minister mentioned some of the issues in the Bailey report in the UK, Letting Children be Children, including the inappropriate manner in which various retail outlets were selling children's clothing.  What I am hoping is that we will be able to get tough on this and to have strict guidelines for retailers and advertisers.  There is money to be made from the shortening of childhood and from encouraging children to have adult attitudes from an earlier stage of their lives.  There is money to be made from the music industry — the whole "X-Factor" music industry is particularly directed at children — and from clothing and make-up, so advertising in these industries is being directed at children of younger and younger age groups.  Although commercial interests are powerful — money would not be spent on advertising if it were not powerful — we have a responsibility in this House to protect childhood.  I appreciate the Minister's response and ask her to indicate the potential legislation in this area.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I had hoped the Minister for Justice and Equality would be present but I am quite sure the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will deal with the matter and take it to the Minister's desk.I will not dwell too long on the issue of forced labour as the Minister of State is very familiar with it.  She understands the industries involved.  There is an urgent need to criminalise forced labour.  The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, some of whose representatives are in the Visitors Gallery, has recorded 169 cases of forced labour over the past six years, but we know this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Without a law against forced labour, victims will not be identified and unscrupulous employers will continue to engage in their current behaviour.  Asking a victim of forced labour to pursue his rights through the existing legislation, be it health and safety legislation or employment legislation, as has been suggested, is deeply problematic.  The experience of victims to date is that they do not receive protection or justice, despite these so-called protections being in place.  Not one person has been prosecuted for any of the offences in forced labour cases.  This reinforces the requirement for a stand-alone offence of forced labour.The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is due to make a decision shortly regarding any legislative and administrative measures required to address deficiencies in the law in this area.  We need clarification in this regard.  We need to bring Ireland into line using its legal commitments at EU and international levels.  The Minister of State understands what these commitments are.  We ask that the Minister outline urgently the Government's plans to criminalise forced labour in Ireland and protect the most vulnerable of workers in this Republic.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will mention the Minister, Deputy Shatter, who is not present.  I know the Minister of State will take our comments back to his office.  What I get from the answer is a positive in that the Minister is not saying no legislative change is needed but that it may be needed and that, in due course, it may happen.  However, the Minister of State can understand that, as Deputy Dowds said, we are effectively talking about slavery in this Republic currently.  While the legislative process must take its course, that gives little satisfaction to those who are suffering.  While we are talking about slavery, about 2012 and about a Republic, what we need to do is to ensure that any investigations into the necessity for legislation take place immediately and that legislation which we know is necessary is introduced as soon as possible.  A dateline for that would be greatly appreciated.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his contribution.  In keeping with the tone of the previous speaker's contribution, it would be easy to list cuts implemented under previous Administrations but that would not be fair to the people affected by this change.  A few weeks ago, the Minister addressed students in the Gallery and it was one of the most inspirational things I have seen in my short time in the House.  Many developments in education are incredibly exciting such as reform of the junior and leaving certificates, tackling the dreaded points system, addressing vested interests in the context of school patronage and admissions policies and tackling the issue of literacy and numeracy and the fact that Ireland is slipping down the league table, as the Minister correctly stated.  In a short time in the Department, he has, therefore, tackled a significant number of issues that are fundamental to how our education system is structured.It is impossible to make a cutback in the education system without affecting the quality of provision, which no Member would deny, and nor would they deny that when a €3.8 billion budgetary correction is made, education cannot be ring-fenced.  I wish that could be the case but it is not possible.I spent time yesterday in four of my local schools and I spoke to the members of a particularly impressive student council in Manor House school, who referred to junior and leaving certificate reform, their hopes and dreams and what lies ahead of them.  They referred to how important guidance counselling provision is to them in their school.  It is not easy to be a young person in modern day Ireland facing into the leaving certificate and university life in the current circumstances.  It is not their fault if they happen to be aged 16 or 17 attending secondary school in the middle of a recession and budgetary corrections.  A number of the guidance counsellors I met spoke about the impact of the recession on their students and the fact that they hear discussions about what is happening in their kitchens and bedrooms at home.  They are aware of financial pressures and their parents have lost jobs.  They hear about people in their classes doing stupid things and getting involved in behaviour that they should not.A guiding hand is important.  If we take the sense of vocation out of schools, then we will lose pretty much everything.  The position of guidance counsellor is important but it would have been easier to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools, as happened previously, which would have result in the guidance counsellor having fewer things to guide the students on because they would have had fewer subjects to study.  That is one of the choices, unfortunately, the Minister and the Government faced.This is a great opportunity for the Government and the Parliament, given the Minister has been so open about the challenges in the education system.  It would be easy to say we have the best system in the world but the PISA results say otherwise.  It would also be easy to say we are the land of saints and scholars but some of our results do not stack up.  Spending on education is an open book.  For example, it does not make sense to spend €178 million on rural school transport but I have an urban bias and the Minister does not agree with me.  Many of us might say it is a great deal of money.  However, in the area of guidance, €9 million is spent on school chaplains.  It is difficult to unpick this allocation because it is provided for in the deeds of trust of many community schools.  We have to unpick aspects of the education budget that do not stand up to scrutiny.  As Deputy O'Donovan correctly said, we are talking about students who are our future and who are going through a difficult time.  They depend on us, their schools and on teachers who, like all public servants, have been incredibly vilified over the past number of years.  They had 14% of their pay taken from them by the previous Administration and they understand why their pay packets are smaller and their days longer.However, the Minister and I know, and the Government understands, that we have to focus fully on children's capacity to achieve their educational potential and education is a liberator.  If one has nothing else, if one's family falls apart or if one is from a dysfunctional community and there are elements in the area that are not working, the only solution that will always work is education and the school in which one has the chance to thrive.I support the Government amendment to the motion.  I accept the Minister's bona fides in this area.  I agree with the previous speaker, Deputy O'Donovan, that we must look at and justify some of the matters on which we are spending money in order to ensure, hopefully, that in the future measures such as this can potentially be overturned or lessened.  I am not sure that anybody in this House would justify spending €9 million on chaplains.I commend the Minister on what he is doing to education.  This is probably the most exciting time in education in a generation when everything is up for grabs, everything is being challenged, everything is being refocused upon, we are getting down to what really matters - literacy, numeracy and making a junior certificate and leaving certificate that work - and we are challenging the vested interests in terms of the patronage and looking at admission policies so that no child is turned away from any door of any schools for reasons which are not in-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Quinn.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unbelievable.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That was me.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will speak along similar lines to Deputy Maloney.  We are all in agreement that what we are being asked to do is a pretty obnoxious deed.  Nobody would pretend that what we are being asked to do is fair, right and just and would happen under any circumstances other than those in which we find ourselves today.  I have heard much about septic tanks today but we are effectively talking about what was and still is in many people's minds a septic bank.  When this period of history is written in 50 or 100 years, Anglo Irish Bank will be written all over it.I know to my cost and that of the community which first politicised me in the Dublin docklands what Anglo Irish Bank was all about.  There is a little school there where I worked and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority promised it a new building.  Two members of Anglo Irish Bank were on the board of that authority.  This was only three or four years ago but people should remember the magic dust that these people sprinkled on this country, which was incredible.  One could not, in all seriousness, question anything that these big developers, builders and businessmen were doing.  Everything seemed wonderful and they kept their businesses ramped up.  The Glass Bottle Company site in Ringsend was identified as an ideal site and the authority became involved in a partnership with a third party development, funded by Anglo Irish Bank.  Some €400 million was spent on the Glass Bottle Company site and it is now worth €34 million.  The promissory note my school got for a new school building went up in dust, and for the foreseeable future it is condemned to an 1840s-era building.Many people have been betrayed by the bank and the crazy attitudes surrounding it.  It goes against everything I know to be just or right to stand in the Parliament like this and speak in favour of what we are doing.  As Deputy Maloney has quite rightly said, I know we are effectively talking about putting a €30 billion promissory note process on the table in the hope that we win €1.25 billion, all the while understanding that we have €147 billion of ECB money in our banking system.  I do not gamble.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Even somebody like me would know that gamble is not worth the risk.  We may lose this battle on the €1.25 billion, and it is right and just that we in this Chamber at every opportunity have the right to discuss the process.  Payments like this should not happen without having a proper discussion or debate through the likes of a private Member's motion.  That is the way Parliament should work and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue.  This is something about which the public will want a very tight explanation.  Unfortunately, we have little more to say than that we do not think it worth the gamble.Effectively, we are looking at a process of working with our European partners on something that is much more valuable, which is deconstructing the promissory note and changing it so we get some real change for this country.  What would happen if we defaulted on this or previous payments?  The European Central Bank, ECB, might have found it interesting as it has €110 billion in the Irish banking system at 1%, and it may have increased the interest rate.  What would happen in that case and how could it be explained to the people who are rightly protesting and want to know what on Earth the Government is doing?This is something we inherited and it is not of our making.  Nobody in this Chamber would agree that this is the fault of the Fine Gael-Labour Administration.  We are dealing with the issue as we find it, although we are not happy about it.  The bigger game is the €30 billion figure, and I am not somebody willing to win a battle to lose a war.  We should be careful about the information we send to our constituents when we are, correctly, discussing this payment to the unsecured and unguaranteed Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Fianna Fáil Party burned teachers when it reduced their pay by 13%.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this plan.  Obviously the plan does not happen in isolation and relates to a number of different strategies, some of which have attracted criticism just as the jobs initiative had originally.  That jobs initiative was launched almost a year ago.  Figures recently published indicate there were 6,000 additional jobs in the hotel and catering sector which had benefited from the reduction in VAT.  The people want to see these sorts of decisive measures taken by the Government and the connectivity between the measures in terms of the pensions levy and the result.  Regarding this jobs plan, the Government, which is leading the country, needs to come up with a narrative about why we are doing this and where we want to go.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill and thank the Minister for being in attendance in order that he might take on board the points being raised.Having a properly constituted legal profession is a must in any republic.  People need to be confident that the Judiciary and the legal system are even-handed and representative of them and can be trusted.  We did not need to be informed by the troika that there were problems with our legal services.  I congratulate the Minister on his reforming zeal in this regard.  Among those who do not come from legal backgrounds, there is a perception that the law is practised by an elite, the members of which attended certain schools, possess a particular mindset and flex their muscles when anyone suggests there is a need for reform in the way in which they do their business.  This was brought into stark focus late last year when, approximately one week before a referendum on the holding of Oireachtas inquiries was due to take place, a letter was sent to The Irish Times by a number of former Attorneys General.  The individuals in question became very excited about this matter and indicated that granting the powers being sought to the Oireachtas would interfere with the independence of the Judiciary.If we in this republic are serious about reform, there cannot be any sacred cows.  Everything must be tested and investigated and capable of being renewed or reformed.  I hope the Judiciary and the legal profession will understand that what the Government is doing represents an attempt to bring the profession into the 21st century, make it more accountable and ensure it is more real to the people.  The profession must be rooted in society and should not be the preserve of those who come from particular backgrounds or were educated in certain schools.  Such individuals tend to dominate the corridors of the Four Courts and other courts throughout the country and are of the view that they are the only citizens who have authority in discussing these issues.A previous speaker referred to the Northside Community Law Centre.  Many Deputies have engaged in consultations on the Bill and a number of concerns have been expressed which I know the Minister will take on board.  It is only reasonable that we should ensure that anything we enshrine into law in this House will not need to be corrected at a later date.  The common criticism of any attempt to reform the legal profession relates to its independence.  In that context, concerns have been expressed about the independence of the proposed new regulatory authority, the way in which members of the authority will be appointed and the control the Minister will have in respect of many of its functions.  If there is a myth in this regard, it must be exposed because we do not want accusations, suggestions or arguments not based in reality to be made.  There is a need to deal definitively with the position of the proposed regulatory authority which will have overarching responsibility in this area.  If there are concerns, they must be dealt with.  In addition, if there are questions on the independence of the authority, they must be addressed.  We cannot be seen in introducing reforms to be creating further problems.  There is certainly a need for further consideration of this matter.Previous speakers referred to access to justice and the establishment of multidisciplinary practices.  Concerns have been expressed to the effect that such practices will not lead to an opening up of the legal profession but will, in fact, result in it becoming even more closed off.  Access to the law and justice and fair representation is crucial in any republic, as is the concept of citizens being considered equal under the law.  If one walks into the Four Courts, essentially what one will see is people wearing pinstripe suits being responsible for individuals in tracksuits being sent down.  The grotesque reality is that the greatest crime one can commit in the State is to be poor.  Poverty is the only thing we ever seem to criminalise; the statistics from any of the major prisons bear this out.  Statistics for literacy levels among those who inhabit penal institutions also underpin what I am saying.  All that we ever seem to become excited about are crimes committed by those who come from certain backgrounds or who are in certain desperate situations.  Access to law and legal representation is, therefore, key in the matters to which I refer.I ask the Minister to re-examine the position on multidisciplinary practices to determine whether they will improve access for those of lesser means or of if they will create an unintentional barrier to such access.  I do not believe there is an option in terms of waiting to see how it all works out.  Access to the law and legal representation is so fragile that there is an acute perception among those in certain parts of society that they cannot obtain justice, that justice does not serve them and that this republic does not cater for their needs.  If we are seen to introduce a new strand to the legal profession which, essentially, will compound that perception, the reform being attempted in the Bill will only make matters worse.  As a result, people's views on their ability to obtain fair play will be completely undermined.While I congratulate the Minister on what he is trying to do - he is certainly taking on certain vested interests which, as we have seen, do not like to be challenged - it is of paramount importance to ensure we do not do anything which could undermine the overall objective of the Bill.  We must also ensure the independence of the proposed new regulatory authority cannot be questioned and that the multidisciplinary practices, if they are to be established, will be constituted in a way which will not inhibit access for those of lesser means to proper representation.  That is the least anybody could expect in a modern republic.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the findings of the Mahon tribunal report.  I wish to raise four separate points - first the findings and what they say about Irish politics; second, the findings in regard to my party, the Labour Party; third, the recommendations of the report, many of which I agree with but concerning some of which I would have certain opinions; four, the fundamental need for local government reform as a lasting legacy for Irish citizens, today and for generations to come.I refer to the findings.  This report is a damning indictment of the toxic political culture Fianna Fáil has brought to every level of political life in Ireland.  It gives me no pleasure to read this report or to discover the level of poison, lies, corruption and bribery that has been such a feature of Irish politics in the past.  It should be remarked that there are many decent and disappointed members of the Fianna Fáil Party but their emotions are secondary to those of our citizens whose lives and communities have been broken by the Fianna Fáil style of politics.  When a political party such as Fianna Fáil believes it owns Ireland and has the title deeds of the country in its back pockets any action by a member of the party is seen as excusable as long as he or she remains electable.  The only value Fianna Fáil holds dear is electability.  No lies, corruption or allegations of bribery ever matter to Fianna Fáil because to its members the party is everything and politics is just a game.  It is not good enough to act like an infantile football manager, claiming one did not see the incident, blaming the referee and retreating to the dressing room, telling the team they must win at all costs.   This is not a game - it is national politics.  It is far too grave and important for such pathetic behaviour.Fianna Fáil was the party of all my grandparents but it became the home place for every cowboy seeking career advancement because they knew the party no longer had any standards.  The issue is not just corruption - it is about the manner in which corruption is treated.  Accusations against Fianna Fáil members, councillors, Ministers, and leaders were treated with derision.  The party defended the indefensible, prioritising stroke politics and hoping the people would believe that all politicians were the same and all political parties were on the take.  They succeeded because standards in Irish politics flattened.  As a society we must examine why every Deputy mentioned in the Mahon report continued to enjoy massive support  from the electorate.  Fianna Fáil Deputies rightly point to those mentioned in the Moriarty report yet Fianna Fáil was happy to enjoy the support of Deputy Michael Lowry for its Government until last year, regardless of what evidence was heard during the course of the Moriarty tribunal hearings.Not all political parties are the same.  One party of long-term government stands head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to backhand politics.  That party is Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil now has the country it shaped.  No other party had the influence over Irish life it has had.  With the party in power for 22 of the last 25 years, Ireland is now what Fianna Fáil created - a country effectively run by the IMF, with a demoralised people who view politics with suspicion and cynicism.  I can barely utter the word for my job -  politician.  Fianna Fáil has destroyed the words "republican" and "politician".  It is clear from listening to the contributions from many Fianna Fáil Members in the House today and yesterday that nothing has really changed.  They joined the party knowing its history of corruption and remained members even though the party surrendered this Republic to the IMF.  They can do no more damage.  Fianna Fáil has no role in the future of politics in this country.I turn to the issue of the Mahon report's findings in respect of the Labour Party.  The attempt in some quarters to paint all politicians and all political parties with the same brush in the wake of the Mahon report does not stand up to scrutiny.  The Labour Party has a proud record of standing up and speaking out against what this report has proved to have been corrupt practices.  It is important to note that in 1993 the Labour Party expelled the one and only one public representative linked to the party about whom the Mahon report is critical.  John O'Halloran was elected as a councillor in Lucan in 1991.  In September 1993 he was expelled from the Labour Party as a result of his voting record on planning matters while he was a member of Dublin County Council.  The Labour Party was proactive in dealing with such issues as they arose and had no need to wait for a tribunal to be called or for its findings to be published to act decisively.  In contrast to others, Labour Party councillors on Dublin County Council had a proud record in planning matters.   Specifically mentioned in the Mahon report are, on page 1,068, the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte's actions in returning a cheque to Frank Dunlop in 1992, and on page 1,579, the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore's decision to refuse a cheque from Monarch developers in 1992, both of which were described by the tribunal as commendable.  The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton's consistent record in opposing rezoning at Quarryvale is also highlighted.  That is the difference between the Labour Party and others who engaged in, or ignored, corruption.I refer to the recommendations of the Mahon report and the need for fundamental reform of local government.  The recommendations are far reaching and deal in the main with anti-corruption legislation and reforming the planning procedure in our local authorities.  The fundamental reform of our political system is not the abolition of the Seanad, although I support it, or the reduction of the number of Deputies in the House, although I support that too.  It is the reform of local government - the connectivity of the vote of the citizen to the responsibilities and accountability of the councillor and to the functions of the local authority, which are of such importance to each local authority in the country.Local elections in Ireland are notable for poor turnout, being used mainly as a referendum on the national Government of the day, typified by misunderstanding of the role of local councils, and sometimes for allowing councillors to be elected with merely a few hundred votes.  This dynamic must change and the reform of local government must involve the levelling of local taxation, including a property charge and a rebalancing of powers away from unelected officials towards the elected councillors, who by the very nature of the reformed system will be more accountable to the people.Writing in last week's The 
Irish Times Diarmuid Ó Grada cites some of the anomalies in the local government system in Ireland.  Leitrim has one councillor for every 1,444 constituents while Fingal has one councillor for every 11,377 constituents.  A local government system with fewer councils and fewer councillors is surely desirable.  Accountable local politicians who set the rates and take responsibility for formulating budgets around areas of policy such as waste disposal would prevent the type of debacle we have seen in Dublin city recently with the privatisation of the bin service.I refer to the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, which are wide and varied and deal with planning, conflicts of interest, political finance, lobbying, bribery, corruption in office, money laundering and asset confiscation.  In terms of the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 and 1906, there are recommendations on the specific act of bribery.  However, as both Acts are over 100 years old and society has changed radically since their introduction, the Minister for Justice and Equality needs to completely overhaul the legislation and make it more robust and relevant to the modern age.  In planning, the overarching watchdog for council development plans, that is, the national development plan and the national spatial strategy, must be placed on a statutory footing.  I have some concerns about two recommendations.  Recommendation 12 states: "The Tribunal is recommending that where the elected members decide to depart from the recommendations made in the Manager's Report [of a development plan], they should be required to state their reasons for doing so."  Recommendation 14 states: "The tribunal is recommending that the Minister for the Environment's ability to give directions to Regional Authorities and Local Planning Authorities should be entrusted to a Planning Regulator."  Both recommendations assume the corruptibility of the elected councillor and Minister but do not take account of the potential corruptibility of the unelected official or proposed independent planning regulator.  The democratic legitimacy of all agencies of the State is key to how we rebuild democracy.  It is from the people that political representatives gain their mandate and it is a deficit of accountability in the past which has lead to corruption.  While not rejecting these recommendations in totality, it is important that the balance of power within local authorities edges towards those who are elected, not those who are appointed.This report gives our democracy a chance to change, to be reinforced, to re-engage with the people, and to reform in such a way that we never return to the type of politics that have brought such disgrace to this Republic.  We must expect better and demand better from ourselves and from those who play leading roles in public life and from those who cast their votes.  Fianna Fáil stroke politics is over.  Our Republic demands better.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Justice and Equality have stated that they are working on legislation to introduce a levy on online betting.  When might that come before the House?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am disappointed by some of the inflammatory language used on both sides of the House.  Anyone who would suggest that those on social welfare benefit are in receipt of a suite of allowances should check his or her language.  Anyone who recommends the introduction of biometric scanning should have that costed.  We have 450,000 people on the live register and I would like to see how much biometric scanning of that number of people would cost and where we would find the finance for it.  This is a particularly insulting suggestion for those who are going through the turmoil of unemployment.  To suggest that there are not enough activation measures is to assume the Pathways to Work document was never launched and is not in existence.Some of the challenges in the social welfare budget are stark.  While 450,000 people now depend on social welfare, the Minister was required to take more than €300 million out of the social welfare budget.  She has achieved a minor miracle in taking that amount of money out of the social welfare budget while keeping the basic rate of social welfare untouched.Further reforms will be needed.  We will shortly be looking at next year's budget and at how we can target child benefit in order to focus on lower income families.  We must tackle the issues of employer's sick pay, social welfare for the self-employed and other initiatives.I congratulate the groups that have campaigned on the lone parents issue in the last number of months.  I met some of them yesterday.  It is encouraging that a group of people who were once so derided and were the recipients of politicians' scorn are now so articulate and empowered to fight their corner.  Whenever I raised this issue with the Minister in the last number of months, as Labour Deputies such as Deputy Ciara Conway and others have also done, I have felt nothing but a sense of compassion and respect from the Minister.My colleague, Councillor Jane Horgan-Jones, proposed a motion on this issue on behalf of the Dublin North-Central constituency council at the Labour Party Conference last weekend.  The motion pointed out that 18% of all families are now lone parent families, that lone parents are more likely than any other social group to be living in consistent poverty and that children living in lone parent families are experiencing deprivation and poverty more than any other demographic.  The motion asked the conference to recognise that when the impact of taxes, benefits and child care costs are combined the financial incentive for lone parents with young children to take up employment is lower in Ireland than in any other OECD country.  The motion also asked the conference to note that lone parent families are headed predominantly, although not exclusively, by women, and that this issue is therefore intrinsically linked to the struggle for gender equality in society.  The motion asked the conference to recognise that the single biggest barrier to the labour market for lone parents is the availability and affordability of child care, as mentioned in the 2009 ESRI report on female participation in the Irish labour market.  The motion asked the conference to recognise that lone parents of both genders often experience difficulty in accessing work, education and training opportunities because of a lack of good quality affordable child care and after-school care.  The Dublin North-Central constituency council was asking the Minister to refrain from imposing any further cuts to benefits for lone parent families and to address the issue of child care.  I am glad to say that is exactly what she has done.Many of those who have campaigned against this measure have said seven years is too young.  The Minister agrees with that.  She has said she will proceed with the measure to reduce the upper age limit to seven years only in the event that a credible pathway to the delivery of such a system of child care is in place by the end of this year.  If that is not forthcoming the measure will not proceed.  This is a Minister who listens and who understands the social welfare system and the nature of unemployment and child poverty.All sides of this Parliament must launch a war on child poverty.   The one issue we have consistently failed to tackle effectively in recent years is creeping child poverty, which is deepening and getting worse.  It is something on which we must launch a war. The Minister understands the position, which is why I commend her for her clarification on payments to lone parents.  I caution all sides of the House to avoid the inflammatory language being used in the debate.  Those in receipt of social welfare payments desperately need the payment and deserve greater leadership from Deputies in the Chamber.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in the Chamber.I want to bring to the attention of the Minister of State the level of panic heavy weather warnings bring to areas in my constituency and others.  My colleague, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, from Dublin South-East has said the same.  Heavy weather warnings have been issued for today, but by 2.15 p.m. Dublin City Council had downgraded the threat.  That said, areas across Dublin city and throughout the country have major flooding flashpoints whenever heavy rainfall occurs.  In my constituency, areas such as Artane, Coolock and Donnycarney are at risk and in the past 18 months I have witnessed the same families being moved out of their homes on a number of occasions.  When we have heavy rain warnings now, panic ensues and people contact local authorities to see what plan is in place.  They also contact their local representatives to find out whether there is a plan in place.  It is disconcerting that families have to huddle around radios and televisions for the weather forecasts in their worry about where they may end up living the following week.I accept that the responsibility in this regard falls to the local authority but I hope the Minister of State will address the issue.  Is he satisfied that the various programmes that have been outlined by his Department for flood relief and flood risk assessment have been rolled out?  Is he satisfied that in terms of the local authority response, his Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government give adequate support to that response?  It is only when one is faced with the chaos of a flooded street or home that people quickly realise that despite the bravery of local council workers and the fact they work around the clock and they put their own safety in danger, resources and plans should be in place that automatically come into play when these situations arise.  Are there weather alerts that will ensure these plans will be activated and that the various agencies will know how to respond?I am aware the local authorities are responsible for these issues but they are concerned with the long-term strategic view and plan of the Government, which is to ensure that investment is put into infrastructure in local areas so as to ensure when there is heavy rainfall - which may be a climate change issue to which we must get used - local authorities are fully equipped to deal with that.  Not alone that, we must ensure the State has taken its responsibility seriously and has made the interventions and investments required to correct any flood risks that exist.I urge the Minister of State to respond to these points.  We cannot allow a situation where some of our citizens are terrified at the prospect of heavy rainfall.  This is what I face this week for my constituents.  They want to know that they will not have to live under this cloud.  There are other implications to this, such as house insurance.  The Minister of State has been proactive previously in dealing with the Irish Insurance Federation on this but people whose houses are continually flooded cannot get house insurance.  Incoming buyers will not get insurance either, rendering the property effectively worthless.  This is the situation I face in my constituency and other Deputies face the same.  I would appreciate a response on this.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised.  I have some questions about how the OPW is assessing climatory change and the risk of flooding in the future.  I am delighted to note the level of investment at a national level.  I know he joins with me in sympathising with residents who are concerned about weather reports.  I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on his discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation regarding the difficulties in obtaining house insurance experienced by residents whose homes have been affected by flooding.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We never said that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The announcement of a new water body came as no surprise.  As a Deputy, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government communicated to me about a consultation period that would end on 24 February and would seek submissions from the public.  I engaged with my constituents and received a number of submissions.  Until recently, there has been a conversation with the public concerning the potential of a water charge.This debate gives the House an opportunity to discuss water conservation and reinvestment in water infrastructure.  It also gives us an opportunity to have a new maturity in Ireland about the connectivity between taxation and local services.  As Deputy Kevin Humphreys correctly stated, this connectivity was broken in 1977.  Since then, people have not seen any connectivity between the taxes they pay and the services they receive.We need a level of vision.  People will not accept it if we tell them they will pay for something that will not improve.  There is a significant water pressure problem in my constituency.  For two winters in a row, many areas in Dublin suffered water shortages due to freezing temperatures.  There have been boil notices in places like Galway and Ennis.  Everyone knows about the system's level of leakages.As Deputy Kevin Humphreys stated, it is difficult to attract FDI to my city while this situation persists.  How can people be convinced to spend a weekend break in Dublin at Christmas if they cannot be assured of getting water from taps?  The local authority system has depended almost completely on the commercial sector and schools to pay water rates.  This is not sustainable and I welcome the proposal of a more realistic model, which we will be able to discuss for two years.I have always favoured water rates, but there is a natural nervousness among those who are not in a position to pay.  We have a responsibility to them.  Where they have high levels of domestic water usage, there must be a generous free allowance.  There must also be a recognition of areas with poor water supplies and pressures.  However, it would be crazy to stand over a system in which up to 44% of treated water is lost within the system.Connectivity is important.  With the best will in the world one can have all the advertisements and public information campaigns on water conservation one likes.  Unfortunately, it will not be until water is metered that conservation is likely to occur.I have never believed in flat taxation on anything, be it in the form of bin charges or water rates.  I am delighted this has not been the suggestion in this instance and that there will be no upfront charge.  I also welcome that Irish Water will be a publicly owned body.We must tell people we have had difficulties with the water system and this new system is a unique opportunity to get past those difficulties and to make the water system dependable and quality-assured.  People state they pay taxes for wasteful and inefficient services they do not trust.  We need to show a vision and point to this as a fantastic opportunity.  Although it stems from the memorandum of understanding, from a social democratic perspective in a mature society the imposition of a water charge is progressive because it is environmentally minded and is aimed at conserving water.Connectivity between taxation and services is required.  As I believe in the public provision of essential services, including water, I would support the imposition of a charge.  If it ensures that we never have a water shortage again, that leaks are fixed and that areas of my constituency which have had diabolical water pressure for the last 100 years will finally get the water service they deserve, I will support it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have come a long way from the story of Anne Lovett, a girl of 15 years who died in her school uniform while giving birth to a child in 1984.  We have come a long way since a member of my own family was refused re-entry to her secondary school 20 years ago on becoming pregnant at 17 years.  Irish society has moved on, but our legislation has not.  It is important to recognise in this House that there are many schools around the country which deal with this situation every day in a compassionate, caring and understanding manner.  If we bring ourselves back to the days of Anne Lovett, we are back to a situation where we isolate and condemn and push teenage parents out of the education system.Pending the introduction of legislation, the Minister should ask the Department to issue a circular immediately to all secondary schools to advise them how to deal with such cases.  They are doing so under their own policies.  They need guidance and policy advice from the Department.  I recognise that the Minister has pre-empted this discussion by  creating a working group on admissions policies and indicating that the legislation is pending.  However, in this case, we need a circular immediately from the Department.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are fantastic models of practice, as we have heard.  Two months ago, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education visited a project in Tallaght which is run by Frances Chance on behalf of Barnados.  It also deals with student fathers, whose emotions also need to be cared for.  As was suggested when we visited the project, leadership is taking place within communities and schools, but it is not coming from the Department.  We are waiting for legislation on enrolment, which is fair enough.  However, we need an immediate communication from the Department to all second level schools giving policy advice on how to deal with a young student who finds herself pregnant or with a young father who may be going through emotional turmoil.  It is important we take that leadership.  I suggest the Minister of State talk to his officials and ensure it takes place.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not an army.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sinn Féin prefers austerity.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the further coordination of the activities of the National Educational Welfare Board or, in the Irish language, An Bord Náisiúnta Leasa Oideachais, in so far as they relate to matters connected with the prevention of non-attendance on the part of certain students registered with recognised schools and for those and other purposes to amend the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and to provide for related matters.This Bill aims to bring all enrolled four and five year old children in recognised schools under the remit of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  First, the House must acknowledge the level of political apathy in Ireland.  My constituency had the highest turnout in the recent referendum, but the figure did not even reach 60%.  When such a high proportion of the people are so disconnected from politics that they do not even show up to vote, it highlights the fact that we have a serious problem.  This is most evident in local elections in which often a candidate can be elected with a few hundred votes and have extensive rezoning powers.  We have had a long discussion about various tribunals and the inappropriate use of powers by local authorities.  When examining how we can address the issues of political reform and the funding of political parties, we have to look fundamentally at the disconnect between the public and the political system.  The local government reform proposals that will, I hope, be brought before the House will address this because the connectivity between the taxes people pay and the representation they receive is hugely important.  The dynamic in local elections is completely different from that on the doorstep in a general election.  Even at this most fundamental level of our governance system where politics start, we are not making that connection properly.  People do not see the connectivity between their vote, the representation they receive, the services provided and the accountability they require.  If it breaks down at local level, it makes sense that the connectivity between the public and politics in a general election will be similar.The level of voter turnout is a problem in poorer areas, while the lack of political participation is a particular problem among younger age groups.  I wonder about the validity of people only being allowed to vote once they reach 18 years of age.  I acknowledge this issue will be up for discussion in the constitutional convention which I hope will be assembled shortly.  When a young person turns 18 years, it is potentially the first time he or she will be disconnected from his or her community and live away from home.  It is the first time he or she will have the opportunity to vote.  The education system has responded by introducing a new civics course, CSPE, but I am informed by student bodies that it is not extensive enough.  Some strides have been made in the education system to awaken political interest among the student body, but a lowering of the voting age allied with local government reform and making a connection between voting and the responsibilities of local government could change voter and political apathy.  However, there is a sense that there are strokes and corruption in politics.  Comments are made to Members and councillors all the time about brown envelopes and so on.  Anybody who visits the Chamber realises it is particularly dysfunctional and not representative of society.  It reminds me of going to UCD on my first day as a young student and realising some people walked around as if they owned the place because, effectively, they did.  I get the same feeling walking into the Chamber because generations of certain families have served in the House and these Members feel like they own the place.  When I consider that 87% of the membership is male, it makes me realise something is wrong.  Only three Members are openly gay, which is unrepresentative of the people we are trying to represent.  Almost every Member is exclusively middle class and 100% of us are white.  If we are serious about addressing the issues in the country, the Oireachtas must be more representative of those we are trying to serve.I attended a report launch yesterday by the integration centre.  The speakers referred to the integration of new communities in Ireland, the stresses and strains in communities and the positive impact sport could have.  They spoke glowingly about the fact that one only had to be resident in Ireland for six months to have a vote in local elections.  That is a positive development, but it is clear that even though 13% of the population are not originally from Ireland, nobody in the Chamber comes from that background.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's office affording me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House to discuss this matter.I do not normally raise matters concerning constituents on the floor of the House.  However, a telephone call which I received last night from a distressed person distressed me so much I felt I had to raise this matter not alone on behalf of the person concerned but on behalf of all persons in Ireland who may be experiencing such financial constraints they cannot pay their bills.My understanding was that the Minister had reached agreement with service providers that no essential service, be it electricity or gas, would be cut off from a household so long as a payment plan was in place.  The person concerned is a working woman and single parent.  Her electricity was cut off yesterday by Airtricity and she spent last night in a relative's house.  She feels completely humiliated, dehumanised and shamed.  That this company believed it had the power to disconnect electricity from her home, which she needs to keep her household going, is shameful.  Perhaps the Minister will say if all service providers were party to the agreement reached with him.  If not, is it his intention to bring all service providers around the table again to ensure this does not happen again?I have a few specific questions for the Minister.  Have other similar cases come across his desk or been received in his Department?  I fear this is not an isolated incident.  Also, is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland Electricity has since 1966 operated a zero disconnection policy for domestic customers, except where fraud is identified?  Where domestic customers get into serious arrears a meter is installed in the home and a proportion of the money put into it goes towards paying off the arrears.  This policy follows direction from the North's utility regulator, which viewed electricity supply as a health and safety issue.  Does the Minister believe, as I do, that electricity supply is a health and safety issue?  Does the energy regulator have an opinion on competing service providers who offer inducements to customers to switch providers and who then utilise small print to punish them when they find themselves unable to pay?  Does the Minister or the energy regulator have an opinion as to the payment options offered to customers, which often restrict the capacity of some customers to pay, which is the situation in the case I have raised today?I understand that the Minister cannot respond to each individual case raised by a constituent with a Member of this House.  I raise this issue not on behalf of the person concerned but on behalf of all people throughout the country who may find themselves in a situation where they are unable to pay a utility bill.  I heard today on "Liveline" of a woman who borrowed money from a moneylender and whose life is now fundamentally falling apart because of the pressure being put on her by that moneylender.  People make unfortunate decisions when pressure is put on them.  Does the Minister share my concern in regard to utility providers cutting off essential services to households and what in his opinion can be done about this in the short and long term?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister's extensive reply.  The case to which I referred is one I hope will not be repeated throughout the country.  I am glad the regulator conducted an audit of all service providers late last year and that quarterly reviews take place.  It is important to reiterate to anybody in the country under payment pressure that these criteria are in place; this agreement has been reached; it happened because of a Government initiative; some of the companies not involved initially have come on board; and customers have armoury when dealing as individuals with service providers.  Companies competing in this market make the switch from one service provider to another seem seamless, profitable and beneficial to customers experiencing serious financial strain.  Customers may switch from a more traditional service provider to a new company on the market but before they know it, it appears to be the worst decision they ever made because the new service provider has found a glitch in the terms and conditions, which may have been glossed over by the customer, whereby the company can come down heavy with regard to payment.  There is also an issue with regard to the payment plans which companies permit customers to enter.I congratulate the Minister on his initial initiative.  We would not be having this discussion unless the initial initiative had been initiated.  I urge the Minister and the Department to be rigorous in this regard.  The phone call I received last night was very distressing.  I can only assume it is happening throughout the country.  I do not trust the companies involved.  The fear factor with regard to people having their services disconnected helps the companies to pressurise those in various communities to pay money they may not necessarily have.  I make the point that the last thing we need is people accessing money - which they cannot pay back - from moneylenders or loan sharks in their communities who give simple answers.  The problems are compounded.Service providers have a huge responsibility.  This is a health and safety issue.  If people are legitimately trying to get their house in order, their bills regulated and their situation on a more sound financial footing they should be assisted.  They should not be dealing with unscrupulous service companies trying to browbeat them into paying money they do not have.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, previously and he has engaged with the IIF, but not enough is being done.  Last night, I met residents in the Artane area who were still suffering the consequences of floods in 2008 and 2009 and on 24 October 2011.  If one cannot get house insurance, one's home is effectively worthless, as no incoming buyer can get a mortgage without house insurance.This situation is out of the control of residents.  Many of the areas were not affected in the 2002 Dublin floods and whatever has since occurred is probably a question for the local authority, but the residents are unable to get flood insurance for their homes.  Will the Minister of State ask the IIF to engage more readily with local authorities in finding solutions to the flooding problems that clearly still exist?  This is not just a local constituency issue, given the fact that the situation in Cork is on many people's minds as well.  The problem affects other constituencies.  The city council does not seem to be undertaking a process to reach a solution in respect of the River Naniken in Artane.  Will the Minister of State update us on the councils' negotiations with the IIF?  Residents need house insurance if their homes are not to be made worthless by a situation that is beyond their control.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The indication is that the IIF, while making underwriting decisions on insurance, considers the claims history of the property and any flood protection measures implemented by the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities.  Clanmoyle Road in Donnycarney is an example in my constituency and I am quite sure it is replicated nationwide.  Extensive works have been done by the city council but the position has not changed for those householders.  The council has indicated to me that a hydraulic analysis of the River Naniken is required but there is no funding to do it.  What happens then?  Works are required but there are no funds, although applications have been made to the OPW with little success.  What is the householder to do when there is a need identified by the city council but works have not been carried out and people are left with no home insurance?I ask the Minister of State to engage again with the insurance federation, the local authorities and the Office of Public Works to ensure that any identified needs necessary to expedite this problem can be carried out.  When a process is place, the works can be presented to the Irish Insurance Federation.  This cannot carry on and residents in my constituency and throughout the country should not be looking at dark clouds and wondering if the problem will happen again.  That is the exactly what is happening in my constituency and I am sure it is the same in other Deputies' areas.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply and I appreciate that much work has been done on these matters. In explanation, the communications protocol gives an assurance policy, so to speak, for children. In the short space of time the Minister has been in office, she and her Department have been doing a great deal to wipe away the history we have had of neglect of children. However, there may come a time in the future history of our State where we will once again neglect children and their rights. This protocol gives an international insurance policy for children and their advocates to appeal to the United Nations and have those rights vindicated.We have not yet signed it. The Minister has stated clearly to the House that she intends to sign it, which is to be welcomed, but the question is on the time line. I understand she is in a particularly busy period and the amount of legislation she is dealing with is impressive. The children's rights referendum is coming up. Hers is a particularly busy Department and it is also a fairly new one, but the signing of the protocol would mean a great deal in that we would be meeting not just our domestic obligations to children but our obligations on the international stage also. We now have a chance, given the way children have been treated in the past, to be a shining light internationally. The signing of the protocol as soon as we possibly can would ensure this. Can the Minister give a specific time line in that regard and also for ratification of the second one about which I have asked?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to share time with Deputy Bannon.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter because I believe it to be of particular importance. I passionately believe that we as legislators have an obligation to protect that precious place that is childhood. In the past we failed collectively as a society. Now is our chance to rectify that and stand united in this effort. I acknowledge the work of the late Ms Mary Rafferty who, in 1999, brought to our screens the horror of what so many of our children went through in industrial schools. Her programme, "States of Fear", led to widespread horror at the depth of abuse, both physical and emotional, that some of our citizens were put through. Last year, I had the honour of presenting Ms Christine Buckley, one such survivor of this abuse, with the Labour Party's Evelyn Owens award. Mary Rafferty's follow-up programme in 2002, "Cardinal Secrets", then documented how those in leadership roles failed to investigate or deal with complaints of abuse. However, what is equally distressing is how it also detailed the then political establishment's failure to protect those in the State's care. Let us never be found guilty of such failings again. Let us work together in protecting children. Many issues will divide us in this House but this is not one of them. I include in that reference the children currently housed in direct provision centres as their parents await decisions on asylum applications. They too need protection and I hope the Minister will ensure adequate safeguards are in place so that in 15 years' time we do not see similar horrific scenes on our televisions about abuse. The move by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to put in place legal requirements on mandatory reporting through the upcoming Children First legislation is most welcome, as is the imminent creation of a national children and family support agency. Alone, however, these moves are not enough. We need a cultural shift in which children are put at the heart of our social agenda. This referendum is the beginning in creating that dialogue as it sets down a legal minimum standard. The Constitution needs to be amended so that there is a general recognition and affirmation of the rights of the child. We need to ensure there is provision for the State to intervene in those very rare cases in which a child's parents have failed to protect him or her. We need the Constitution to treat all children equally regardless of whether their parents are married. We need to be certain that when proceedings affect children, their best interests are paramount in achieving a resolution.Finally, we need to ensure that the views of children are sought and considered in any proceedings affecting them. Last week I wrote a column for thejournal.ie about the long road this referendum has taken. Since 2007 there have been three different wordings proposed for a possible constitutional amendment. The wording before us tonight is the fourth such proposal. We have spent the last decade trying to make this amendment perfect. In using the term "we" I am referring to all of my colleagues in all political parties and those not in any party who have served the people during the past ten years. In 2007 the then Minister of State with responsibility for children proposed that Article 42.5 of the Constitution be deleted and replaced with a new article that affirmed the "natural and imprescriptible rights of all children". Later that year the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established to agree an all-party consensus. This committee met 62 times over a period of 27 months and produced three reports. The final of these reports, in 2010, proposed different wording to strengthen children's constitutional rights. More recently, in 2011, a third wording was agreed but never formally published by the Minister, who had been appointed in 2008. However, with the arrival of the troika and the change of Government in 2011 this issue was sidetracked and the task to put this to bed fell to the new Government and the new Minister. It is clear that before we set out to take on this challenge a significant amount of work had already been done on this issue and that should be acknowledged. Given the care that was shown by previous officeholders and the work that has been done by this Government and the last Government, we prioritised this measure as a stand-alone referendum to ensure that the debate could be clear and focused. It was also decided to hold the referendum on a Saturday to give maximum opportunity to all citizens to have their voices heard. It is crucial that those voting for the first time have the chance to help to bury the painful legacy of the past and to make history for our children. I am honoured to serve on the Labour Party's campaign committee on this issue alongside my colleagues, Deputies White and Conway and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Lynch. I look forward to working with those from all sides of the House to get this referendum passed. I hope that we will continue the debate on children's rights and child protection indefinitely in order that we ensure that we protect childhood for everyone. My long-term hope is that, as legislators, we can create a culture of listening and that children's views can to be taken into account in all aspects of their lives. This amendment empowers Members to draft and pass legislation to copper-fasten the rights of the child and mop up the anomalies in our law. I look forward to working with everyone here as well as the NGO sector to continue the advancement of children's rights in future. Childhood is precious and I am proud to be a part of the political system that has finally woken up to this fact.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for dealing with it. The latter has shown an excellent commitment to flood prevention measures generally and has responded to all of the issues I have raised in this regard in the House. I am obliged, however, to raise the situation of the residents of Maryfield Crescent in Artane, which was flooded in the summers of 2008 and 2009 and again in October 2011. On rainy days such as today, the residents become worried that they will endure further flooding. Dublin City Council has indicated that before any flood relief measures can be taken in the area, there must be a hydraulic analysis of the Naniken river. The problem, however, is that the council claims it does not have the €50,000 required to undertake that analysis. When I inquired recently as to whether the Office of Public Works might provide the council with the funding it needs to proceed, I was told that such an analysis is not eligible under the minor works scheme. The situation, therefore, is that the council cannot proceed with the hydraulic analysis which is a prerequisite to the implementation of any potential flood relief measures. The expenditure involved, at €50,000, is very little in the overall scheme of things but could have a huge impact for these families. Some of them have no home insurance and, as such, their properties are effectively worthless. Any potential buyer of a house in Maryfield Crescent would likewise be ineligible for home insurance and would not, therefore, obtain a mortgage. In other words, the residents are locked into their current homes for the foreseeable future. Will the Minister of State indicate whether the OPW will provide the necessary funding to Dublin City Council to carry out the required hydraulic analysis of the Naniken river? Without that analysis, the council cannot identify a long-term strategy for the alleviation of flood risks in the estate and the residents will remain in a no-man's land. I acknowledge that significant flood relief work is ongoing in other parts of the country and in other areas in my constituency, including the Clanmoyle Road in Donnycarney. In the case of Maryfield Crescent, however, no remedial process can commence until the hydraulic analysis is carried out, after which the council would be in a position to identify a way forward. As I said, an outlay of only €50,000 might be the first step in making life easier for the residents. Although I am loath to raise this issue in Dáil Éireann, I have little choice in the matter since Dublin City Council has washed its hands of it. It is probably not a matter for this House, but I am obliged to take this opportunity to seek the Minister of State's assistance in moving towards a solution.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply and his acknowledgement of my frustration and that of the residents in question. Will he give a commitment that the OPW will liaise with Dublin City Council officials in order to move the situation forward? I am sure he will agree that the current stalemate is unacceptable. Every heavy rain warning is a cause of great anxiety for the residents of Maryfield Crescent.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to contribute. When I was elected to the House, I realised that positive announcements would be few and far between during our time in government. However, when the Minister announced last April that the practice of incarcerating children in St. Patrick's Institution was to end, I was proud of what we were achieving and I believed we were moving towards a new republic. I visited the unit and met its residents and staff, but the report's findings are disgusting. Although Judge Michael Reilly is to be commended, why were the concerns of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, regarding St. Patrick's Institution not heeded? Judge Reilly's report states:I met a child on B Wing who was on 23 hour lock up. This child was quite fragile. He explained to me that he was now talking to himself.It also states: "This was the first time that any prisoner, in any prison, had displayed such fear in my presence." Another part of the report states: "The bed clothes were dirty, the toilet was blocked and he had no running water." By what date exactly will the practice of incarcerating children in St. Patrick's Institution come to an end? How will those who oversaw the maltreatment of children there be held to account for their actions?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his response. I agree that this issue is down to a minority of staff but how can we expect any child to be rehabilitated when the behaviour outlined in this report is ongoing? The individuals who were victims of this malpractice will have no faith in the justice system at any time in future until the people responsible for these actions are seen to be held accountable. Will the Minister expand on the issue? Will the Minister provide an assurance on direct provision centres, which are also causing much concern for those with child welfare on their minds? Will they be subject to the same type of investigation as is evident in this case?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I propose to share time with Deputies Kevin Humphreys and John Lyons. I will focus on reform, literacy and empowering the public service. What the Minister is trying to do in primary, secondary and further education at third level includes junior certificate reform, a literacy and numeracy strategy, a review of the enrolment policy expected in the new year, anti-bullying strategies and a forum on patronage and pluralism. A major amount is happening in the education sector. It is important to realise we cannot achieve any of these without empowering the public service. Major reform is being undertaken. I stress that it is disingenuous of Government backbenchers to talk about the Croke Park agreement and to issue disingenuous statements on the agreement that undermine the respect we have for public servants and that completely misunderstand the relationship Departments must have with teachers and those involved in the education sector. When we try to reform, we must bring people with us. When we try to reform the junior certificate, we must bring with us teachers, educators and school boards of management. When we reform elements of the further education sector, we must bring with us the people engaged in it. When trying to stress the importance of literacy and numeracy in primary schools, we must bring with us the people who will deliver such programmes. These people have taken a 14% pay cut and have been asked to work longer hours. They feel continuously under attack, under strain and undermined. I plead with so-called experts on the Croke Park agreement, who probably have not read it, to take time to pause and realise that none of this reform can take place without the goodwill of those involved in the sector. Many of our schools, further education bodies and universities run on goodwill. Undermining that goodwill undermines everything. It is almost impossible to achieve any reform without a sense of leadership and asking people to come with you. Issuing a poorly drafted, incoherent and disingenuous statement that completely misrepresents the Croke Park agreement and what it can achieve undermines the reforms these people are asking the Government to proceed with and deliver. Literacy is extremely important because we have convinced ourselves for so long that we are the land of saints and scholars. We have a literacy problem and it cannot be fixed by the education system. A three year old child from a welfare dependent family will have a vocabulary of 450 words, whereas a three year old child from a professional family has 1,200 words. The gulf exists before the children come near the education system.The education system can only do so much. We have prioritised literacy and numeracy at primary level and have empowered teachers to deliver that. We are doing the same at second level in conjunction with junior certificate reform, which also has a significant literacy component. I ask the Minister to act on the suggestion of the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and make a space on each of the education and training boards for an adult learner in order that they can complete the circle of the literacy process. We must empower all those involved in the education sector, including adult learners, students, teachers and administrators. We cannot reform from the top down. We must reform in conjunction and in partnership, and with a fundamental understanding of what happens in schools and in colleges of further education.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Remember Bertie.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He never said that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is much agreement across the House on what credit unions give to communities in every section of Irish society. In the past couple of weeks I have taken the opportunity to speak to members of Donnycarney Credit Union and members of the credit unions in my constituency in Fairview and Clontarf who have told me that the basic role of credit unions is now keeping the wolf from the door of many households which in previous generations might easily have turned to moneylenders. We should take the opportunity to give credit to the credit union movement for what it has done. It is a not-for-profit organisation that is community-based and oriented. Some of the sums of money credit unions deal with are very small, but they are a means of keeping a family on the straight and narrow and can make a huge difference in meeting the day-to-day expenditure of a family. Everybody who enters a credit union knows its ethos. That said, everybody must accept that credit unions need regulation. When I asked people working within the credit union sector about the Bill and their concerns, they said the one thing they would like to change was section 15(10) which deals with the directors of a credit union. They have genuine concerns that the way in which credit unions operate will be severely undermined if this section is allowed to continue unamended. It states an employee or voluntary assistant of the credit union or an employee or voluntary assistant of any other credit union are not eligible to become a director of a credit union. This is overly prohibitive. Most credit unions operate on the basis of good will, yet the people who work in credit unions and volunteer to help in them selected this section of the Bill as a concern. When I asked them to select one area of the Bill in which they would like to see a change, this was the section they chose. Section 15(14) is also a concern. It states a member of a credit union may not be appointed or elected to the board of directors if he or she has served for more than nine years, in aggregate, of the previous 15 on either the board of directors or the board oversight committee of the credit union. I understand this provision may be being made owing to significant bad practice in the past. Perhaps some individual credit unions operated in the manner of fiefdoms. However, as previous speakers said, we should not over-regulate the credit union system because of the sins of a few. Most credit unions have a long history of dedicated service in order to allow the credit union movement to survive. The nature of voluntarism and community activism has changed in Ireland and many of those working in the sector are looking at the next generation and concerned because most of their members are not young. Most credit union volunteer members are of a particular generation which had a different understanding of community interdependence. While understanding the need for regulation of the credit union sector, I suggest that if one element of the Bill can be re-examined, it should be section 15(10) dealing with the board of directors. The Minister should also reconsider the length of time for which they may serve. The overall thrust behind what the Department is doing is laudable and important, but we should also remember that it is the credit unions that are keeping moneylenders out of business. It is not in our interests, therefore, to put credit unions out of business.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for affording me the opportunity to speak on this matter and I thank the Minister for coming into the House to address this issue. I am sure all Members would agree that cyberbullying is a major and increasing problem. We are mindful of the families of Ciara Pugsley and Erin Gallagher who reportedly died by suicide as a result of cyberbullying in the recent past. I received responses to two parliamentary questions recently, one from the Minister's Department and one from the Department of Justice and Equality. The Minister's Department indicated that a working group is due to report by the end of November and, in fairness, it has been quite proactive in addressing bullying and is taking the issues in regard to cyberbullying quite seriously. Any fair-minded person would say that schools are not the only answer to tackling bullying. Children do not live in school, they live in communities. Parents and other members of the family have a huge role to play. If a parent is told their child may be involved in any sort of bullying it is very difficult for them to take that on board and they often assume their parenting skills are being brought into question but that is not the case. Bullying can happen to anybody and it can be carried out by anybody.  The response I received from the Department of Justice and Equality seems to indicate there is a grey area relating to cyberbullying because we are not sure if cyberbullying can come under section 10 of the 1997 Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act and it has been referred to the Law Reform Commission. I suggest a cross-departmental group needs to be set up to discuss this issue in order to tackle it properly. It does not only come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills or the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. The organisation SpunOut.ie believes such a cross-departmental group could potentially investigate a number of matters. It could investigate how schools could intervene in cases of cyberbullying, even if the bullying happens off-site. It could clarify if current legislation offers any remedy to victims such as barring or restraining orders as well as providing guidance to the Garda and schools on how to deal with cases of cyberbullying. Schools and members of An Garda Síochána need clarifications from the authorities that set out these guidelines. We need to examine the possibility of establishing a team within the Garda who can track IP addresses through Internet service providers. The Department of Justice and Equality indicates that the Internet providers are quite proactive on this and work not only within the law but within the spirit of the law, but we need to nail that down. We need to examine how we can encourage schools to work with parents to remind them to monitor their child's Internet use and help their children if they are victims of cyberbullying and also to help their children if they believe they are engaging in bullying behaviour. Often a victim of bullying is the person who becomes a bully after that experience. While the Minister's Department is doing great work and while the Department of Justice and Equality is mindful of the serious issue of cyberbullying, I request the Minister to consider the establishment of a cross-departmental group to properly tackle this issue. I would appreciate if he would respond to that request.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I accept that as cyberbullying is a form of bullying our response cannot be just technological. We must also deal with the reasons for bullying in the first place and we must have a whole societal response. Bullying often relates to self-esteem. There is an obvious connection between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Law Reform Commission in rolling out a more comprehensive response to the problem. The Minister stated the draft report would come back by the end of November and that a proper report would be done by the end of the year. This is speedy and I congratulate the Minister on this and I welcome it. I hope when the Law Reform Commission investigates the issue of cyberbullying that it expedites the matter quickly. I suggest that a cross-departmental group would examine the issue in more detail at that point. I ask that any consultation process includes students and young people because they are most at risk. They deal with social media on a much more regular basis and they are more aware of the effects of cyberbullying on them and their peers. While the work of the Department is laudable, as the Minister stated cyberbullying is a 24-7 phenomenon and the reaction to it cannot be just within the education system. It must be in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The cross-departmental response to this would be more comprehensive and might get further. I ask the Minister to respond to this suggestion.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter. I congratulate the Minister for his initiative. We need to be radical when it comes to education. Far too often, there has been a sense of "Sure, it is grand". It is important that we do this. There is a considerable gap between the political system and the staffroom and that gap is often filled with ill-informed or ill-advised media comment about what teachers do and their pay structures and responsibilities. In any reform package, it is impossible to achieve anything in education without bringing teachers with us. That disconnect, which I see far too often between the staffroom and the political system, is something of which we must be wary and which we must address. We must empower teachers to implement the reform packages that we propose. It is so important to bring teachers and students with us. I undertook a tour of my constituency and spoke to students in Manor House in Raheny, in Holy Faith, Clontarf and in Holy Faith, Killester, in Chanel College in Coolock, in Dominican College, Drumcondra and in Mount Temple. I am quite sure when I was speaking to them they were not sure whether I would address their concerns in Leinster House, but I am doing so. All those students, to whom I wanted to speak because they were the ones who most recently sat the junior certificate, were supportive of the 60:40 balance but had concerns about the restricted subject choice which was the original proposal. The latter has been addressed by the Minister, and I welcome that. I also spoke to a number of schools' staff about it and I am slightly alarmed about the disconnect between the staffroom and the political system. When I talked to staff about how they feel, I heard they feel completely under appreciated. They feel the sense of disconnection, a sense of disempowerment and a sense of not being appreciated for the hard work they do. They are asked to drive and be empowered by reform packages that come along, and yet they feel that their vital role in education is not being appreciated. I asked why they feel this. Sometimes they blame the Department, but they also blame society and media comment. I make this appeal to those who are concerned about education, to parents, students and anybody who feels strongly about the power of learning, and learning for its own sake which is at the core of the new reform package, that one cannot ask a teacher to engage in this process if one strips away the goodwill on which every school runs.Anybody who knows anything about education knows that schools run on goodwill. If one interferes with that sense of goodwill, it effectively interferes with a lot. Staff have told me of their concerns about tampering with the relationship they cherish as advocates for their students. The new assessment model is a concern for them. They are also concerned about a potential dumbing down of the junior certificate. I do not agree with their sentiments but I do know their sentiments are real. If they feel the new assessment model will change the vital relationship they have with their students as advocates for students' advancement, and if they feel there is a potential dumbing down of certain subjects, including history and geography, we have a body of work to do. We cannot ask teachers to engage in this process, take on the work of reforming the junior certificate, change the model of education in schools and bring in short courses if they feel at the outset that there is a disconnect. I ask the Minister and the Department to re-engage with the secondary school system by whatever means necessary. Teachers' unions and the Government have a responsibility for this matter. I believe there is cross-party support in this House for what the Minister is trying to achieve. We have a responsibility to encourage and empower teachers to bring these issues forward. If one starts off with a belief that this is not achievable, however, one will not believe in it. We cannot ask anybody to implement something they do not fundamentally believe in. I believe in what the Minister is doing and I know the Minister and the Government believe in it also. Across this House, people are accepting the bona fides of what the Government is trying to do on this matter. We cannot expect teachers to believe in it if we do not address their concerns, but we will do so. We must take those concerns seriously and work with teachers to reform the junior certificate for the benefit of students, which is at the core of what we are trying to achieve.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Being an advocate of legislation to deal with the judgment in the X case has been a lonely position to adopt. My party, the Labour Party, has fought a lonely battle on this front for 20 years. Before the last general election no other party mentioned the X case. We stood alone on that platform and suffered the consequences. As a a party, we take the flak, receive the vulgar letters and the abusive telephone calls and encounter the protests. It is our family members who are targeted, homes that are picketed and campaigning that is systematically disrupted. It is we who suffer the dirty tricks of other candidates, both party members and Independents, who scaremonger in whispered tones on the doorstep and laugh at us when the inevitable happens when we knock on the same doors. However, we have no difficulty with this when we know we are right. What we want to do is to protect women and vindicate their constitutional rights and the sacred votes of the people cast in 1992 and 2002. Neither I nor my party have any apology to make in regard to the course we are taking because we know that it will lead to legislation being presented to the House by the sovereign Government of the land, legislation that will be scrutinised by the Office of the Attorney General and survive the many challenges that will inevitably follow in every court. I thank the hundreds of my constituents who contacted me, horrified by recent events and determined not to be intimidated any longer, to demand legislation. I pay tribute also to the dignity of those who have taken part in vigils outside Leinster House, including this evening, and those who have marched through Dublin city and attended demonstrations throughout the world. My sister in London reported that she felt sick in her stomach thinking of Savita and that she had flash memories of the people who had shouted at us during the election campaign. In this debate what we witness from one side is a corruption of language. How dare they describe themselves as being pro-life if they let a situation persist where women's lives are endangered, rather than introducing the legislation the Supreme Court and the people have demanded? How dare they describe anybody as being pro-abortion? I do not know anybody who is. Abortion is always a tragedy, but it is a greater tragedy to put at risk the life of a mother to satisfy the washed-out ideology of a failed Ireland. I have no interest in political perception or showmanship. I vote to win. Unfortunately, the legislation before us has no chance of success in the House and it would have a smaller chance of success were it to be challenged in the Four Courts. However, I am convinced that we will legislate as a Government. Let us not be divided by tactics; rather, let us be united by our determination. We have more allies on this issue within the House now than we have ever had and refuse to be intimidated any longer. The day is gone when the fanatical tactics of a few dominated the considered compassionate view of the many. This is a Government that takes its responsibilities seriously. We will act in order that no woman or medical professional will be in any doubt as to his or her constitutional and legislative rights and responsibilities. Too often in the recent past we have been ashamed as a people internationally. On this issue we will not be found wanting.

Last Tuesday a constituent of mine was shot dead in Furry Park in Killester. A street was cordoned off, Garda barriers were erected and local children learned that a man was shot. Eamon Kelly was a notorious criminal but daylight murder should not happen in a civilised society. There are those who would openly argue that as long as these people are killing each other, it does not matter. There are those who say people who live by the sword die by the sword or that this was no loss. These people do not have a clue about what they are talking. I am thankful this murder did not injure or harm any bystander or other innocent party.However, such events imprint themselves on the consciousness of a community, which is not healthy. I know children who have lost family members to violent crime, and this has created a scar that will last a lifetime and poison their minds, possibly irreversibly. The killing of Eamon Kelly was connected to the murder, also in my constituency, of Alan Ryan, who was shot dead on 3 September last. The Irish Times reported the following in connection with the killings:Gardaí believe Ryan was shot dead in a conspiracy between a number of crime gangs as part of their efforts to resist the extortion demands of the Real IRA, with Ryan having led that extortion campaign. Intelligence suggests the Real IRA believe Eamon Kelly had assisted the gangs in organising the Ryan murder, with Kelly believed to have been gunned down as a result of his involvement.Deputy Kevin Humphreys and I represent areas where young children and men are dragged into gang culture as they seek a perverse sense of empowerment. I have a number of direct questions for the Minister. Does he agree that murder is murder regardless of who is the victim and whether he or she is known to the Garda? Does he have a view on how we can prevent this specific feud and feuds in general from spiralling out of control to avoid further bloodshed? Does he agree that constant attacks by politicians and media commentators on the pay, terms and conditions of the Garda Síochána are undermining Garda morale? Is he confident the Garda has sufficient resources to address this issue? How can we prevent young men and women from being sucked into this destructive way of life?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his response and ask him to elaborate on the following statement in his reply:It is also unrealistic to expect the Garda Commissioner to devote his entire resources to protecting individually people who are routinely trying to avoid the Garda in order that they can continue to engage in criminal activity. Such an approach could only come at the expense of ordinary Garda activity to protect the community generally.If there is a suspicion that someone may be shot, surely other persons in his or her vicinity will also be at risk? I will repeat my question and ask whether the Minister agrees that murder is murder. The Minister of State's reply did not give any of the Minister's thoughts on how the feud to which I referred could be prevented from spiralling out of control. We are aware of two killings related to this particular issue, both of which occurred in a small geographical area of my constituency. How can we prevent someone else being shot? Both of the recent killings took place in broad daylight. Such events do not take place in a civilised society and I do not want to see Garda tape about the place when I travel around my constituency. I am not convinced by the reply the Minister of State gave. While I do not expect the Garda Commissioner to devote his entire resources to protecting those who are at risk of assassination, at the same time, we must understand the nature of these types of murder attempts and who could be hurt or potentially killed as a result of them.  The Minister of State addressed the issue of Garda resources. Does he agree that when people consistently attack Garda pay and conditions, which are covered by various agreements, they undermine Garda morale? How can we prevent young people from disadvantaged areas being sucked into a criminal way of life to pursue a perverse sense of empowerment?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We will take the two slots separately.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I had a chance to speak briefly on this issue on the night of the legislation put forward by Deputy Clare Daly. This issue, as has been stated, is the single most divisive one in Irish politics. Every politician who talks about abortion always says it is a very sensitive issue, and then nothing happens. Effectively, this issue has seen the greatest amount of political cowardice and hypocrisy of any in Irish debate. I was not politically active in any way - I was only a child - in 1983 when the pro-life amendment was made to the Constitution. It was introduced by the same people who were against contraception, divorce and all other supposed social ills that would bring Ireland to its knees. In my view, and that of others, the 1983 amendment effectively reduced the status of a woman to that of a vessel, effectively, to that of a womb. Inevitably, regardless of those who warned against the actions of the group which was intent on pursuing that course of action, the X case arose in 1992. I need not go over the details of the case but it is sometimes convenient when we call a teenage rape victim X rather than give that person a name. It is sometimes easier for us to merely call a person by an initial rather than discuss a human being. The Supreme Court determined that a constitutional right to abortion existed when there was a real and substantive risk to the life of the mother and the constitutional right was vindicated in a referendum by the votes of the people that year. As it stands, that is the position. There is no legislation. The 2002 referendum - let us not recast what happened - was a cynical attempt to remove the threat of suicide by a Fianna Fáil Party in pre-election mode, and it also was rejected by the people. Where are we? There is a constitutional right which is left without any legislation. The 2002 referendum was not an attempt to legislate. It was an attempt to pander to pro-life voters and to subvert the X case judgment, and they failed. We are all told to be calm and respectful and Ministers make reference to a free vote so that Members can wrestle with their consciences. I was surprised at the speech made earlier by an Independent Member. I remember canvassing during the general election an hour after that gentleman and being confronted with the issue of the Labour Party and abortion at every door. It is amazing how the wind changes and people's positions change. I looked through the pre-election manifestos before I came into the Chamber. There was no reference to legislating for the X case judgment in the manifestos of the Fine Gael, Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil parties, or in the manifestos of any of the members of the United Left Alliance. Only one manifesto mentioned the X case. It was my party, the Labour Party. We have had a consistent approach to this matter because we understand law and we understand the responsibilities of legislators. I am bewildered by some of the contributions made in this House today and last night. Reference was made to a "herd mentality" and a "rush to judgment". A Member, only a short time ago, spoke about people "exploiting the death of Ms Halappanavar" - I find that quite offensive. How can one have a herd mentality and a rush to judgment after 20 years? The expert group makes it clear that legislation and regulation is needed. The pro-life stance states Ireland is the safest place in the world to have a baby - if I have heard that one time in the past couple of weeks, I have heard it a thousand times. If that is the case, if there is never a case when a woman's life may be at risk, then what is the problem with legislation? Of what are they afraid? The reality is when there is a problem, women simply travel to England. I have asked those who have experience of this to contact me in the past couple of days and some of them have. I will not name these women. I have an e-mail before me. In it, the lady writes that she found out she was pregnant on 11 November, the day of her partner's birthday. She gave the pregnancy test to him as a surprise birthday present, and he was doubly delighted as they had only been trying for three months. She then discovered that her baby's condition was incompatible with life. She writes that they travelled to Liverpool to the women's hostel where they talked her through the procedure, gave her the tablet to stop her body supporting her baby, and told her to go and rest in a hotel for two days. She writes that this was the hardest part. She did not want to leave the room, she felt as if she was going to die, and all they did was watch the clock for the next 48 hours until they returned to the hospital. Fortunately, the reserves arrived in the form of her aunt and mother who helped distract her from her partner. She writes that the hospital was great in accommodating all four of them with beds and food. That same morning they induced her and she went into labour by lunchtime, which went on until 10 p.m. that night when they finally had to give her painkillers.  Junior, as the lady calls her baby, was born asleep after 10 o'clock. She writes that they asked those taking care of them to hand him to her partner first so he could check that he looked okay and he sadly stated he was perfect. They then got to hold him and look at his hands and feet which were all perfect, and then they were able to have him blessed by a priest, and that during the blessing even the midwife cried with them. She writes that the midwife then gave them an imprint of his hands and feet and although she initially refused photographs in her dazed state, the midwife kindly took them anyway and informed her they would be put on file and she could collect them at any time, for which the lady is now very grateful. In addition to the emotional cost, the lady writes that financially, she and her partner were set back €3,500 as well as her extended time off work, that though the necessity of terminating a child would be no less traumatic in any situation, the fact that they had to slink off under a cloak of lies and guilt is unacceptable, and that she personally felt an overwhelming desire to explain to everyone she came across, even a taxi man, that she wanted her baby, she did not want to be doing this but she had to so that her baby would not suffer. Such a case will not be dealt with under X case legislation. Another lady wrote to me about her sister. She writes that after further scanning, her sister and her husband were told that the baby had severe abnormalities. The brain of this baby was never fully developed and it had other abnormalities, and they were sent home to be brought back the next day to have further scanning. She writes that she will never forget this day as long as she lives, seeing the devastation on her sister's face as she curled up on the sofa with her lip shaking while she tried to fight back the tears as she felt like her world was falling apart. She writes it was so hard to watch. The following day, after detailed scanning, doctors came to the conclusion that the baby was, in fact, incompatible with life and would not survive outside the womb if the pregnancy even managed to reach full term. She writes that both her sister and her husband booked flights to London, that when her sister went in for the procedure, she was devastated and kept explaining to the nurses that she really wanted this baby, that it would not survive once it was born, and that she was trying to justify herself. She felt like she was doing something wrong because her own country had made her feel this way by not providing this service.The person who wrote the e-mail continued that it is absolutely disgusting that in this day and age, women are forced to leave their own country to have terminations in cases where their much-wanted baby would never survive. A lady named Siobhán wrote about a condition called anencephaly, in which the brain and skull do not develop fully. She wrote that on the day of the scan, she found that her baby would not live. While that was devastating enough, she and her husband were then told she could continue on with the pregnancy for a further 20 weeks to her due date and, if she did not wish to do so, she would be obliged to travel to the United Kingdom to terminate the pregnancy as the law in Ireland would not allow anything to be done here. She writes that, consequently, she travelled with her husband to Liverpool and spent a few surreal days carrying on as if all was well with their world while it actually was turning upside down. They met the team in Liverpool's Women's Hospital, who were kind, gentle and compassionate and were sorry Siobhán and her husband had to be there with them. The hospital team gave her a tablet to take and then she and her husband were obliged to leave the hospital for 48 hours before returning. She writes these were 48 hours of trying not to think about what was happening and trying to act normally in a city they did not know while separated from their families and friends, including their two children, aged four and two. On returning to the hospital, she was given further doses of a tablet every few hours to induce labour and eventually, after 12 hours, her baby was delivered. Siobhán writes that she and her husband held him, named him and cried together for the death of their son. The hospital chaplain came in and blessed him for them. She writes he and all the staff were so sympathetic, caring and understanding at the horrible predicament in which she and her husband had found themselves. She concluded by stating this was her story, which she was sharing in the hope it would bring about change in our country, as the women of Ireland deserve better. A woman called Ruth, whose child unfortunately had the same condition, wrote she could never have been prepared for what she and her husband were told that morning, as the experts scanned her. Their baby had anencephaly, a neural tube defect that results in the absence of a major part of the brain and skull. The consultant explained that Ruth and her husband had two choices, that is, she could continue with the pregnancy and their baby would die as soon as she was born, or shortly thereafter if the pregnancy got that far, or they could terminate. Ruth wrote that ringing her dear mum and being obliged to break this news to her was utterly heartbreaking. She recalls her mother being so shocked, not by her awful news but by the fact that she and her husband would be obliged to travel to the United Kingdom for termination. Ruth wrote she does not really remember the days that followed, other than the amazing support from her husband, family and close friends. She wrote that she cried and cried and was so angry. The anger was not about their baby's diagnosis, as she had nursed for long enough to realise that bad things happen to people every day, but she just felt so angry that she and her husband were obliged to travel. She wrote she had thought that surely under these circumstances, termination was allowed in Ireland. She wanted to have the chance to stand up in front of a judge and plead her case to allow her to be looked after in her own country, but instead she and her husband were obliged to travel to the United Kingdom with all their grief, feeling like criminals. She then goes on to outline precisely what happened to them but she concludes with the damning statement that although they felt no shame about the decision they had made, this journey made them feel like criminals. The cases of none of the aforementioned women will be dealt with under X case legislation and Members are only discussing the risk to the life of a mother. Much now has been made of the issue of suicide but it is dealt with under the X case judgment of the Supreme Court. Moreover, it has been reinforced in the referendum results of 1992 and 2002. One cannot come into this Chamber and talk about mental health and suicide ideation or complain about budgetary measures in respect of mental health if one does not, in one's gut, trust a woman when she is suicidal as a result of a situation that brought about her pregnancy for whatever reason. One cannot do this if one simply does not trust her and simply thinks she is telling lies. Despite all the wind expended in this House about mental health and suicide, obviously Members do not trust women because, clearly, they will not be telling the truth. All of the e-mails I received came from devastated women, because they know that abortion is always a tragedy. It is as though women wilfully wished to discard their babies and pregnancies because they are so callous. Members must be clear about this suicide issue. It is part of the determination of the Supreme Court of this land in 1992. It was reinforced by the votes of the people in 1992 and 2002 and it must be part of this legislation. Members cannot walk away from this issue. Perhaps, in the fullness of time, when people stop being so cowardly and hypocritical, Members might return to the amendment that was introduced in 1983 and listen to what I consider to be the wise words of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in this regard. The time has passed for talking any further on this issue. I do not want legislation to be introduced to this House via a Private Members' Bill as it must come from the Government and must come from the Office of the Attorney General. Moreover, the idea of a free vote is an absolute nonsense in a modern parliamentary democracy that must deal with issues of conscience every single day. Members deal with issues of conscience each day. Each day they pass laws and budgets that potentially will hurt people but Members know in their guts that sometimes it is for the greater good. Consequently, this idea of a free vote, mentioned earlier by an Independent Deputy and previously by a Minister of State, is a nonsense and cannot be allowed to happen in this situation because the women of Ireland need to know the Government of the day is on their side.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«While I thank the Minister of State for his presence, I had hoped somebody from the Departments of Health or Education and Skills would be here.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes. I hope the Minister of State will pass on my concerns in relation to the Beechpark services of the HSE. Since a school in my constituency - Scoil Chiaráin in Donnycarney - contacted me about this service, I have been contacted by other schools about it. The authorities at Scoil Chiaráin have been told that Beechpark will not provide any more speech and language therapy services to children of primary school age in this term. No guarantees have been received with regard to the next term. There are 18 children in the unit at the school in question. According to the letter I received from the school, "twelve children will now rely solely on their class teacher for SLT support". This is an untenable situation. Beechpark has provided work for the children to do within their mainstream classes, which is not the best way to proceed with children who are so vulnerable and needy. According to a letter I have received from a parent at the same school:Our son is on the ASD spectrum and is currently attending an outreach ASD class in Scoil Chiaráin C.B.S. on Collins Avenue. We were recently informed that our son will not be receiving any in-school Speech and Language support during this new school term. The reason being that Beechpark, the HSE providers, are unable to fill a senior SLT position due to the on-going embargo on recruitment. Therefore their current SLTs are being stretched to the limit, resulting in our son losing out on crucial language therapy. It is imperative that our son has every opportunity to continue to develop his social and communicative skills. We are very concerned as to how this loss in support will hinder his development, going forward.The letter I have received from the school states:Twelve children will now rely solely on their class teacher for SLT support. Our children are enrolled in our outreach classes with the hope that they will be able to integrate full time with mainstream. How can this happen when their supports are being withdrawn? Communication is an essential area of development for children with autism.Essentially, I am asking why there does not seem to be any co-ordination with regard to special education between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills. It is needed if we are to tackle this issue. Everyone understands the economic situation, but that is cold comfort for parents whose children desperately need these services. We are faced with the prospect of saying to the parent of a child on the ASD spectrum that he or she will have to stay within his or her mainstream class for this term, and possibly the next term, because one of the senior speech and language therapy positions within this service cannot be filled as a result of the recruitment embargo. If we believe in education as a great liberator and if we believe in the potential of every child, regardless of his or her learning difficulties, surely we cannot stand over this position. I have been told by the representatives of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged schools in my constituency - the school in this case is a disadvantaged school - that they know of children who have been waiting for two years to access the services they need, including occupational therapy services and the speech and language therapy services that are provided by Beechpark. When they finally get those services, it is a great thing for the school. In this case, Coláiste Chiaráin has been told some of its pupils will have to do without certain services because of the recruitment embargo. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the children in this unit deserve an awful lot better. I will be interested to hear his response.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With all due respect, if I go back to the parents with this answer, they will not be very impressed. They will not be impressed with an indication of the overall economic situation, which they have been told of to death, and they will not necessarily be impressed by a review group. The situation is that a senior speech and language therapy position is not being filled. Reviews are wonderful, but the problem is there are 12 children on the autism spectrum who are being told to go back to class. They are being told, "Here is some work you can do in your classroom with your class teacher". It is completely unfair, not just to the children and their parents, but also to the teacher, who is completely incapable of dealing with the situation presented to him or her. I would ask for a more sympathetic and more realistic answer from the Minister. These are very needy and vulnerable children who have fantastic capabilities and potential. This school received a letter from Beechpark on 20 December stating that the senior speech and language position at the school cannot be filled and that it would not have any service in the first term of 2013 and possibly in the term after that. That is an unsustainable position. A school has to plan for an entire year. The Minister of State will probably agree with me that it is far from an ideal position. I would ask for more than a commitment to a review because a review does not take account of the specific situation in which we find ourselves, where the children are being left without the services they need.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated recently that the Bill to bring about a levy on online betting will be coming before the House very soon. I would like to know when that will be. He also indicated that the levy would not go to the horse and greyhound fund because all levies on bets currently placed in Ireland go directly to that fund. I would like the Taoiseach's assurance that that will not happen with this new levy on online betting.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the opportunity to speak on bullying. I commend Sinn Féin for bringing forward this Bill and for affording us this opportunity to discuss it. Much emphasis has been put on cyberbullying, but it is still bullying. Suggesting getting rid of Facebook, Twitter and the Internet as well as taking mobile telephones off every child and teenager will not change the fact that homophobia existed before Twitter, as did racism and discrimination against Travellers. We must get to the real issue involved in bullying, which is a lack of self esteem on the part of the bully and those who engage in bullying behaviour, and also define properly what bullying is. Bullying is not a once-off occasion of a person falling out with another person. It is a sustained, persistent and negative behaviour, a dominant behaviour of one over another. Parents must understand that. Teachers are generally doing an excellent job in tackling bullying in their classrooms and schools. As has correctly been said, it is a whole-school approach. However, children do not live in schools. Society must understand that. Often we say "if only the teachers taught them in schools" about whatever the social ill of the day is, but children do not live in the schools. Parents must understand that teachers can only achieve a limited amount. Bullying before school, after school and at the weekend is not within the remit of the teacher. Parents must also accept that if they are confronted with the realisation that their child is engaged in bullying behaviour, they should not take that as an indication of poor parenting. A child can be bullied, react to that in a particular type of way and turn into a bully or engage in bullying behaviour. That is not a reflection of bad parenting but sometimes the way these things work out. In my experience, however, parents often find it very difficult to accept that their children are engaged in bullying behaviour and it is therefore very difficult to tackle it properly. A number of great initiatives are under way in the school system. I commend the Irish Traveller Movement on its yellow flag programme, which celebrates diversity, Traveller identity, multiculturalism and sexual identity. Schools can initiate such programmes. We do not necessarily need to be overly negative about what it is happening in schools. Much of what it is happening is positive but we have a culture of humiliation in our society. There is a drive in media and political circles to humiliate and make somebody feel he or she is worthless. If that is a societal issue, we have to address it as such. The Government's proposals, which will be released by the Minister for Education and Skills on Thursday, will be the start of that process but we, as a society, have to reassess how we view people with different identities. I do not know about blaming the method by which people bully each other. There have to be tough constraints on how children can access the Internet, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor alluded to, but pupils have anonymously posted comments about other pupils on toilet walls in schools forever. While I commend Sinn Féin's attempt to bring this issue to the floor to the House and to open it up for discussion, the Bill has flaws. I refer to the proposal for the board of management to have one designated person to deal with bullying complaints and to initiate an investigation into such complaints within three days. That is almost unworkable. The significant work engaged by the Minister should be acknowledged. Acknowledging what is bullying is a societal issue and we must face up to it as a society rather than leaving it to teachers and parents. The school is not the only forum in which bullying needs to be tackled.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We never said that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Never once did we say that.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue of the restrictions announced by the Health Service Executive, HSE, Beechpark services for autistic children in north Dublin and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, for being here in person to discuss it with me. When I previously raised it several months ago, I was told there was an ongoing review with which I should engage. However, that has not been successful from my end. There are a number of autistic units in a number of Dublin northside schools with which I deal frequently, including Scoil Chiaráin CBS and Our Lady of Consolation in Donnycarney and Scoil Bhríde and Scoil Naomh Colmcille in Donaghmede. Beechpark services provide several services for children in these units such as speech and language services, occupational and play therapies and psychological services. These are vulnerable children and the staff are doing their best to serve their needs. There are varying viewpoints as to what Beechpark services can do for a school. Many schools state once they receive the services, they are delighted with them, while others say it is difficult to even access them in the first place. I have also been informed some private diagnostic assessments are not being recognised by the HSE for referrals to Beechpark services, which is an added problem. Schools are now being told that new children will not receive these services. All children will be played off against each other, as the HSE will assess their needs and allocate resources on the basis of the needs various children have. One child may have more needs than another. I do not know how anyone can assess the difference between one autistic child and another. I accept that there are various degrees on the spectrum, but I would have thought any child admitted to a unit needed all the supports he or she could possibly get. School principals will be looking at older children in their units continuing to receive services, while new entrants - younger children - will not receive the same level of service or allocation of resources. Has the review of Beechpark services being completed? Can a communication which brings clarity to the issue be brought to all schools that depend on these services? There is significant uncertainty and trauma associated with this issue. Last Friday the Autism Bill 2012 was introduced to the House and it was graciously accepted by the Minister for Health. Several speeches were made on all sides of the House on how Ireland had grown up on this issue. However, when curtailment of services happens, parents who care deeply about their children and feel strongly about their advancement in life begin to wonder what will happen next. They had a sense of certainty that their child would receive these services but now that is gone. I know budgets are tight and difficult, but it is the haziness, lack of clarity and total uncertainty surrounding this entire issue that need to be cleared up. The schools need to be dealt with in a more professional and compassionate manner. We need to ensure schools and the children's parents know where they stand. We cannot have a dichotomy of services in any autistic unit in which older children receive services younger children do not.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am impressed not just by the Minister's attendance in the Chamber but also his willingness to move off script to give an impressive and impassioned defence of the services the children in question need. I take it at face value that he will communicate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on this issue and revert to me in due course. We are agreed on the need for the children in question to access the services they require. We must also acknowledge, however, that there is significant disconnect between schools, parents and the service providers. This is not good for the relationships that need to be built up over time. This issue needs to be ironed out. The very least the schools and parents should expect is clarity. I thank the Minister for his commitment to deal with this issue and appreciate his offer to revert to me on it. I hope we will have positive news for the parents involved.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«First, I commend the Minister on bringing to the Houses of the Oireachtas the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Bill. When thinking about this subject, it is important that everyone recognises that Ireland is a complex place. For many generations and decades after independence, one was told it was a kind of simple place in which everything was black and white or green, white and orange. Moreover, one was told our identity was quite narrow and to step outside that identity was a dangerous place to be. It has only been in recent years that many families in Ireland have looked back on their own family history and have realised things were not always so simple. As Deputy Nash already has mentioned and in the case of my own family, many people fought in the British forces while many in the same family, who were related to one another, also fought in revolutions here in Ireland.  The context of that time is not as simple as might have been suggested and if one is to be serious about the Republic in which we live, one should note a republic is not the absence of a monarchy. This is what we grew up thinking or believing in and perhaps that is what the struggle was for during the 1920s and earlier, that is, the sense the Republic was the absence of a monarchy. However, a republic is not simply the absence of a monarchy. A republic is a place where all people are equal. A republic is a place in which there is compassion, forgiveness and understanding, as well as respect for people's past, for their allegiances, for what they sought for their families and for what economic necessity sometimes forced them to do. In the main, this Bill pertains to working-class families and is about men who sought to do something they felt was right. I believe there now is a generosity within the Republic to look back at things that happened in the past and to have a different sense of them.  Later today, Members will discuss the issue of symphysiotomy and they recently discussed the position in respect of the Magdalen laundries. It was a kind of dark and repressive Ireland with a highly simplistic view of what was right and wrong and of what was Irish and what was not. Members of the generation to which Deputy Nash and I belong have a completely different view of what is a republic, of our value system and of what we wish to hand on to the next generation. It is not a closed view of Irishness or of nationality. It is not a black and white view of what the country believes in or stands for and is not a green, white and orange view of nationality because life just is not that simple. This move on the part of the Minister means a huge amount to many families. Unfortunately, it has come too late for some men, such as Con Murphy, a former RAF man, who died in Cork recently. However, for people such as my constituent, Peter Mulvanny, who has campaigned on this issue for many years, and those Deputy Nash already has recorded in the Official Report, it means so much that what they did can be legitimised to a degree and that this House and this Republic finally can come to terms with our complicated past. Were we to recognise the complexity of that past and realise things are not always that simple, perhaps we would have a chance to build an Ireland and a republic of which everyone can feel a part. I again appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is something on which one needs to reflect. In the past, nationality in Ireland has been a divisive subject. One was obliged to speak a certain way, look a certain way, dance in a certain way, play a certain game or speak a certain language to be considered to be Irish. We are more generous now and have a better sense of ourselves. We have much more self-confidence to be able to bring legislation such as this Bill to the House and to speak on it with generosity and understanding. I commend the Minister on his action. This means a huge amount for the families involved. They are excited and relieved and believe that finally, they can look back on their own family history and not in any way be obliged to apologise for what their family members or they themselves did. Far too often in the past, indirectly or directly, people were required to apologise for their family histories or to pretend that some family members did something they did not do. There are areas of my constituency in which people are proud of their British Army heritage and why should they not be? We so often pretended that Irish people did not fight in the First or Second World Wars. For so many years, we pretended, for example, that Irish women do not travel across the Irish Sea to gain access to facilities of the health system there that are not available here. We have colluded in a kind of collective silence that makes us believe that Ireland is a simple place. However, it is not; it is complicated. It has a complicated history and today, we finally have come to terms with part of that complicated history. I commend the Minister on so doing and appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy is an embarrassment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«After 20 years.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for being here in person to discuss this issue with me. As he will be well aware, Allied Irish Banks is 100% in State ownership. Yesterday it announced it was adding 0.4 percentage points to its standard variable mortgage rate and raising variable rates at EBS by 0.25 percentage points. As the Minister will know, this move by AIB will adversely affect 70,000 AIB variable rate mortgage holders and put struggling households under further pressure. AIB's average variable rate mortgage is around €130,000 and this rate increase will mean an increase of almost €300 annually for its variable rate mortgage holders. AIB's standard variable customers absorbed a total increase of 1 percentage point in their mortgage rates in 2012. AIB will say that the decision to raise its variable rates is driven by the need to ensure that the bank's lending is at a sustainable level long-term. However, this is the same bank into which the taxpayers of this State have pumped €21 billion during the past four years. It is true to say that AIB has been at the lower end of mortgage lending but there is a genuine concern that it is the variable rate mortgage holder who is being asked to pick up the tab and is being unfairly hit. There is obviously a connection between this announcement and the expected announcement next week from the ECB of a reduction in interest rates, which will be welcomed by those on tracker mortgages. However, it is clear that what AIB and other banks are doing is robbing Peter to pay Paul, and that in order to absorb whatever move the ECB makes, variable rate mortgage holders will be asked to pick up the tab. Considering our relationship with this bank, the €21 billion we have put into it, the level of resentment in Irish society about what the Irish taxpayer has had to do to save it and the amount of pressure mortgage holders are under, any mortgage holders who listened to radio reports or read newspaper articles on the rate increase this morning would have got a cold shiver down their spines when they realised that mortgages they find almost impossible to service will be even more difficult to service as a result of this announcement. Is there a plan to break the toxic link between the pressure faced by those on variable mortgages and those on tracker mortgages? There is obviously a connection between what the ECB will do next week and what AIB did yesterday. Does the Minister have any words of comfort or a direct message of comfort to offer to those who are paying variable rate mortgages and who will do so for the foreseeable future? Mortgage holders who heard yesterday's announcement will have thought about the 1% they were asked to contribute last year. There is a further increase now and they are wondering what is around the corner in terms of what more they might be expected to contribute. Every time there is word from the ECB about a lowering of interest rates, they will expect an increase in their variable mortgage rate. I ask the Minister directly if there is a plan to break this link. Is there some effect he can have on the situation? What words of comfort can he offer those mortgage holders who are literally terrified not just about yesterday's announcement but about what is to come in the coming months and years?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his reply. He states in his reply: "It would not be fair for 2.1 million taxpayers to subsidise 138,000 owner occupier mortgages, especially when the vast majority of these mortgage holders can afford to pay their mortgages." It is unfair that variable rate mortgage holders are asked to subsidise those on tracker mortgages. Those on tracker mortgages are protected by contract yet nobody in this House can speak up for those on variable interest rates. It is our responsibility to do that. Would the Minister commit to coming before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to offer us a three to five year plan to deal with those on variable interest rate mortgages because this situation will get worse? If we are serious about tackling the mortgage crisis we must have a three to five year plan because every time the ECB decides to decrease interest rates that has a positive effect on tracker mortgages but it is being subsidised by variable rate mortgages. That is not sustainable. In order to be proactive and constructive will the Minister come before the committee and offer us a plan to deal with those variable rate mortgage holders? The insolvency legislation is very welcome. It is a first step in tackling this problem. It will be of great benefit to those in mortgage difficulties but we cannot deny that the variable rate mortgage issue is gathering momentum as a problem and it will continue to be a problem unless we have a three to five year plan in order to deal comprehensively with it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht seans a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar seo a chur faoi bhráid an Aire. I am delighted that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is here to discuss this issue. I express my disappointment, however, that this House will be debating the X case legislation for the next two and a half months, during which time parliamentary party meetings will be convulsed in heavy debate and we will all be under intense pressure to deal with an issue that has dogged us for 20 years, yet when a problem pertaining to 6,300 children in care and their educational needs arises, there is only one backbencher - me - to raise it. I find the hypocrisy galling and odious. I refer the Minister to the report published yesterday by the ESRI, commissioned by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, Education of Children in Care in Ireland: An Exploratory Study, which details some of the difficulties children in care have in maximising their educational potential. The Minister is well aware of some of these difficulties such as attitudinal barriers on the part of teachers and principals, placement breakdowns, inadequate care planning, as well as delays and shortfalls in assessment. The Children's Ombudsman has said she was shocked at the lack of adequate information on schooling for children in care. She said, "When encountered, these challenges place children in care at higher risk of suspension, exclusion, absenteeism and early school leaving." It seems there are no data on this issue within the Minister's Department, the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Health. In my experience, where there is cross-departmental responsibility, problems such as this fall through the cracks. In respect of data collection and research, the report states: "A mechanism needs to be established for systematic gathering of data on the educational experiences of children in care in order to inform evidence-based policy making". We cannot have a policy on the education of children in care and how to maximise their education potential unless we know what we are dealing with.  There are some good news stories within the report. There is evidence to suggest that when children in care are placed in foster families and experience a stable family background, they can achieve their potential and do quite well. Without the essential data, however, and the required information as outlined in the report, or unless some scientific research is conducted on the educational experience of all of these 6,300 young people in the system, we cannot plan properly for the future. These are the most vulnerable children in the education system. That is an oft-used term, but these children have been placed in care because of dysfunction in their own families or other particular family situations and they need the education system more than anybody else. Education is the great liberator. It is the only thing that can change one's life, regardless of what happens, whether one is placed in care because of a family breakdown, or one's relationship breaks down, one falls sick or loses one's job. Education is the one thing that will always rescue someone and ensure he or she always bounces back. If we have no data on what is happening to children in care and if we are not digging deep into the reasons they are falling out of the system and underachieving, that is a major failing on our part. Is the Minister aware of the report and, if so, has she read its findings and is she prepared to act on them?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the action the Minister has taken in this regard. If the Minister is appalled and the Ombudsman for Children is shocked at the lack of data, then I am comforted by the fact the Minister has sought to change this. We cannot work on policy to empower the most vulnerable of young people unless we have statistics. Considering schools are falling down on adapting to children in care, do we need to have a circular sent out from the Department to advise school principals and teachers on this? It is one thing to have a policy in place but another to have a circular guiding, encouraging and requiring schools to behave in a particular way. The Minister stated that 96% of children in care between the ages of six and 16, inclusive, are in full-time education. That is a statutory requirement, however. The National Education Welfare Board does not deal with young people outside this age bracket. Any child who is four or five does not come under its remit. I will be introducing a Private Members’ Bill to deal with this soon. Neither does the NEWB deal with any young person aged 17 or 18, another failure in the system. The report’s outstanding recommendation is to have a mechanism in place for the systematic gathering of data on the educational experience of children in care to inform evidence-based policy making. I hope this central issue will be addressed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not want this controversy to distract the Minister from her intention of providing a second year of free child care in the next budget. We must examine the entire model, however, because effectively we are funding private companies to deliver a public service. Does the Minister not think it is time for the Department of Education and Skills to have a central role in this to roll out the Aistear and the Síolta programmes? What we saw last night just would not happen in a primary school, as I know from being a primary school teacher and principal, because of the management structures that are in place. The parents who send their children to these centres want to know what will happen to the centres their children have been in where the incidents took place. Do they have a future and will they continue to receive State funding? Most people in the House would question whether the State should be funding such companies. I do not want to wait for another RTE investigative programme to have a hidden camera in a direct provision centre in Ireland. If we are outraged about this situation in child care provision, as we should be, there are direct provision centres in this country that are also abusing children. We must not just look at the issues raised thanks to the RTE programme last night, but at the provision of State care for children across the State.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her reply and I know her commitment to the area is unquestioned. In her reply she indicated that none of the children depicted in last night's programme would have been in receipt of the free preschool year as they were too young. If we are to convince the Irish people that we need a second free preschool year, we will have to deal with younger children and we must be able to ensure Irish people will have confidence in the system and that the second preschool year will be worthy of taxpayers' investment. I would like the Minister to respond to my question about direct provision centres as the issue is connected to how we deal with children under the care of private providers funded by the State and those funded directly by the State. The Minister knows that direct provision centres are dealing with children who are not being adequately cared for. We all know about this so we cannot let the opportunity go by without addressing that issue. As others have said today, we need a fuller debate at an early stage to flesh out these issues in a more prolonged debate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and thank the Minister for being here in person to discuss it. The Minister has seen the reports that Fingal County Council has identified the site at Clonshaugh as the potential site for its sewage treatment plant. I am sure he is familiar also with the concerns of local politicians and of residents' groups. Effectively, what we have here is Fingal County Council choosing the least contentious site for itself because the only residents it will affect around that site are actually Dublin City Council residents in a different council area. This is where the Minister's Department has to step in. When there are two competing interests between Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council, there has to be a higher authority that can adjudicate between the two situations. I know of residents in Darndale, Priorswood and Clonshaugh who are furious with the potential for a Fingal-based plant to impact on their lives. Most people have always argued for a series of smaller plants, and seven is the number that has been most agreeable. From the point of view of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, does the Minister not believe that to have seven plants would be more environmentally sound and would make more sense? The plant would also impact on a local GAA club, Craobh Chiaráin, and its lands. The idea of having a plant the size of Croke Park at that location is surely environmentally unwise, does not take into account the 10,000 submissions that were made from Fingal residents and certainly does not take into account the 2,500 homes that would potentially be beside this site.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The main point I want to register with the Minister is that, in my view, Fingal County Council has made a decision which is politically advantageous for it because nobody in Fingal will necessarily be affected by this plant being beside them as it is Dublin City Council residents who will be affected. I would like to get the Minister's response on that point.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his reply. I take issue with the suggestion that there has been an extensive consultation process because, as I have already said, the bulk of the residents who will be adjacent to this proposed site in Clonshaugh are resident in the Dublin City Council area and have not been involved in any consultation process undertaken by Fingal County Council. There is a suspicion that this location was chosen purely because it would not have an impact on any residents Fingal County Council is charged with looking after. I reject the Minister's statement. Given that the funding is coming from his Department, we must question the construction of something as large as Croke Park in a place such as Clonshaugh and the environmental implications thereof, because it will surely be shot down by Europe at the end of the day. Why are we waiting for that process to be completed instead of looking at a more low-scale development, such as the proposal for seven plants across that area to facilitate what we are trying to do? The vast majority of residents who have contacted my office about this colossal plant have not been consulted about it. We need to look again at what I consider to be a wrong-headed project.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome that the Legislature is finally reacting to the 20 year old Supreme Court judgment in the X case. This subject can be broken into two parts, the constitutional element and the substantive issue. In respect of the constitutional element, no other parliament in the world would be allowed to disregard a judgment of a supreme court and the decisions of the people in two referendums. It is clear that the legislation only goes as far as the Constitution permits. I implore the Minister for Health to regard this Bill as the beginning of a discussion on a new constitutional amendment which would remove Article 40.3.3° in order to enable women to protect their health during pregnancy and deal with issues of rape and incest, as well as the sensitive issue of fatal foetal abnormality. These issues cannot be addressed in the Bill before us because of the constitutional constraints under which we must operate. It is outrageous for anybody to suggest that we should not legislate. We are required to legislate if we take our Constitution and this Republic seriously, regardless of the substantive issue at hand. We have a Supreme Court and constitutional referendums for a reason. I reject the suggestion by Deputy Martin - I listened to him but he does not appear interested in listening to me - that the previous Government should be congratulated for suggesting that a suicidal victim of rape should be forced to go through with her pregnancy. Supposedly it was a compassionate gesture to put that to the people in 2002. Thankfully, people's opinions have become much more nuanced. Those who argue that we should not legislate for the X case or the referendums of 1992 and 2002 imply that we should stage a constitutional coup. We are being asked to disregard the basis of this Republic. We cannot do that. It has been suggested that the Bill should not be allowed to become a political football but, as a member of a party that has been on the receiving end of political kicks on this issue for the last 20 years, I find that difficult to accept. Every other political party in this House has used it to score political points against the Labour Party. It has been thrown at every Labour Party candidate and canvasser in local, European and general elections in order to distort our party's views and label us as pro-abortion. I do not even know what the term "pro-abortion" means. Our election manifestos for the past 20 years have committed to legislating for the X case. That commitment has been manipulated by others. Hushed conversations have taken place on doorsteps questioning what the Labour Party really wants to do in government and suggesting that we cannot be trusted on this issue. We have been accused of supporting abortion on demand. Thankfully, the position of my party, which has been consistent for the last 20 years, is finally in the political mainstream. People now accept the need to legislate for the judgment in the X case. That is what the people want and the Supreme Court demands. On the substantive issue, all of us have received correspondence arguing that the Bill does not go far enough or that it goes too far. We have been intimidated and put under pressure. Our personal space has been invaded. I cannot understand why somebody would argue that a woman who is suicidal as a result of a crisis pregnancy should not have options. I do not understand the mentality of somebody who believes that a woman should be forced to go through with her pregnancy even though it means she will kill herself. As a society, we are still saying that in respect of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities. If a woman's health is at risk or if she is a victim of rape or incest she has no options if she is not suicidal. Tragically, nothing in this legislation will change that. Who can honestly say it is justifiable that someone we love would be denied options if she is pregnant due to rape or incest? Representatives of a pro-life group suggested to me in my constituency office that a woman in that situation would have the option of going to England. The central issue in this debate does not pertain to the unborn or to abortion; it pertains to abortion in Ireland. We have no difficulty with 4,000 women travelling to England every year but when it comes to upholding a woman's constitutional right to protect her life in this State through medical intervention, the national debate continues for 20 years. That is outrageous. When people from other jurisdictions are told that our debate is about situations where a woman's life is the risk, they are given to wonder whether this Republic is still in the dark ages. We have come a long way in terms of realising the debate is more nuanced than trenchant pro-life or pro-choice arguments would suggest. The debate has been used to blacken people and score political points. There was no political advantage in the stance my party has taken. We were the only party in the last general election to refer to the issue in our manifesto. However, it is a question of doing what is right rather than what is popular. When one knows something is right, one must stand up for it. Thankfully, it appears we are on the verge of legislating for this issue.We must revisit the Constitution in order to provide for those women whose health may be threatened by pregnancy. We should ask ourselves whether such women have options and choices.. Should a woman who has been raped, or a woman who has been the victim of incest, have options? Alternatively, as a State and as a Republic should we demand in all cases that such a woman should be always forced to go through with her pregnancy? I wish cases of fatal foetal abnormalities were covered in this legislation, but unfortunately they are not. I understand that constitutional restraints mean a referendum would be possibly required. As a Republic, how can we force women in each of these circumstances to go through with their pregnancies? How can we do that and call ourselves civilised? Until we have a proper conversation about having a constitutional referendum that would potentially allow these things to take place, we will remain a Republic only in name and we will continue to rely on the UK to help our citizens. These women go to England feeling like criminals. Their health can be at risk. They may have been raped, or be victims of incest. They may be carrying pregnancies that suffer from fatal foetal abnormalities. This State makes 4,000 women a year feel like criminals. All we are providing for in this legislation is that a woman whose life is at risk will be protected and the appropriate interventions will be made. The Supreme Court said it should be so 20 years ago. The Irish people said it should be so ten years ago. This has been a long, lonely, difficult and emotional road. It has not been a popular road to take. People in my party and others who have taken this road have had their points of view distorted, poisoned or misrepresented when they have been trying to save women's lives. Under this legislation, which I hope will be passed even though it is possibly the most restrictive abortion legislation anywhere in the civilised world, this State will continue to tell women whose health is at risk that they have to go through with their pregnancies or go to England. I suggest that from a constitutional perspective, we have no option other than to proceed in this manner. This debate has never been about whether to legislate - it has been about how we should legislate. There has been a conversation around suicide, but we have to legislate for suicidal ideation because that is what the X case was all about. The people said in 1992 that they wanted to retain this provision. I find it remarkable that Fianna Fáil has tried to congratulate itself in some perverse way on the action it supposedly took in 2002. It is bizarre to suggest to the people of Ireland that they should stand back and laud Fianna Fáil for trying to ensure a suicidal woman who wants to kill herself should be forced to go through with her pregnancy. It is monstrous to suggest that this measure was progressive, or that it progressed this argument along. All we are saying now is what the people have said twice, and what the Supreme Court said 20 years ago. The Constitution is quite clear. Anybody who does not stand by this proposal does not stand by the Constitution or by the Republic. On the substantive issue, we should ask ourselves again whether we are really serious about forcing women to go through with pregnancies that would kill them. Are we seriously talking about forcing women to go through with pregnancies that would kill them, or do we just want them to go to England like criminals? I am almost tired of this debate. I am looking forward to the conclusion of the debate on the X case and the enactment of legislation that has been promised for so long. I hope we can then move on in a compassionate and non-party political way and start talking about a constitutional referendum that would ensure women whose health is at risk, women who are victims of rape or incest and women who are carrying foetuses with fatal abnormalities are not forced to go through with their pregnancies. Otherwise, this is not a Republic.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I commend the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House. This is a day which will largely go unnoticed, unfortunately, but it is the day on which we will effectively criminalise slavery in Ireland by defining "forced labour" and reinforcing it as a specific criminal offence. Like my colleague, Deputy Robert Dowds, I congratulate Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, Ms Denise Charlton, Ms Siobhán O'Donoghue, Ms Gráinne O'Toole and others who have worked so hard to bring the legislation to the House, with the assistance of the Minister. Some of the victims are in Leinster House today. They never lost faith in the Republic and engaged with the political system and are seeing their rights vindicated today.Over 180 cases have been dealt with by Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, over the last number of years. I remember that my first political election campaign came in the teeth of the citizenship referendum in 2004, when official Ireland did its very best to have a cloud of suspicion hanging over our newest and most vulnerable communities. We have come a long way since, and this Bill is part of the process, but the political system must show much more leadership across Ireland in dealing with our newest and most vulnerable communities. How brave must a person be to land into a country after seeing civil rights and human dignity suppressed, with nowhere to go and no understanding of the language, and yet still have the opportunity to come to the House today to see legislation passed that will criminalise forced labour? A particularly brave person believes in the Republic and has the Republic believe in him or her. I commend the Minister on what he has done, and what we have achieved is very special. We should focus on certain matters for victims of forced labour. If and when a criminal offence is proved to have taken place after criminal proceedings have concluded, there may be an issue regarding the lack of support and assistance being provided to victims. I hope the Minister will specifically address the issue when he makes his concluding remarks. I celebrate the fact that there is support for the Bill right across this House, but it is important for us to recognise that regardless of how vulnerable or disconnected a person feels, how many rights have been impinged or how lonely a person feels, there is always a group of decent, progressive people who will stand up for rights, using the system for the right end to vindicate those rights. The Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is the group in this case and I heartily congratulate it. We cannot rest on our laurels and we must consider what the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has pointed out in this Bill. It is a good day for the Republic but we must continue to assist those who have been proven to be victims of forced labour, and after criminal sanctions have been imposed, they must be given support to rebuild their lives as citizens of this Republic. That should be the next focus for the Minister, although I commend him and the Bill. I also commend those people who campaigned on the issue, and Deputy Dowds and I have been centrally involved in the matter. We must take stock of today's achievement.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I very much welcome the Minister's comments on the qualification standards that are being rolled out. Compared to child care workers, education professionals such as teachers have a level of job security and status, as well as being trusted and respected. They are reasonably well paid in addition to having solid terms and conditions. People who work in the child care sector tell me that they were horrified by what they saw on the RTE programme. It is for their benefit that these qualification standards will be rolled out in Síolta and Aistear. However, they feel that their terms and conditions of employment are not great. They do not have much job security and their pay is very low. If we are to genuinely invest in this sector, we need people who feel they are respected and wanted and that their contribution is valued. Not only must we concentrate on the qualifications of such workers, but we must also ensure that their terms and conditions of employment are improved, for their own benefit and that of the entire sector.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister knows the importance of this issue for so many young people who have decided to make their career in the noble profession of teaching. When I became a primary school teacher 13 years ago, there were not so many people who were willing to take on that career. It was difficult to find people who wanted that career and to give of their time and expertise and involve themselves in that vocation. However, times have changed. Unfortunately, in my constituency office I am encountering a number of not just students but also their parents who are extremely anxious about the future young teachers have in our system. It is not that they are asking me where are the jobs. Obviously, there have been changes in the training schedule for teachers. There are new online courses to which the previous Government gave recognition. That is fair enough and we are where we are in that regard. We have a number of newly qualified teachers but we do not have jobs for them. That is a fact. It might change over time because of the number of students coming into the system, which is expected to be nearly 70,000 over the next few years. That gives some hope. However, the problem is not just the inability to obtain employment, but also the inability to even get probated. After a three year degree it is necessary to spend almost a year in the classroom to be inspected and given one's diploma, or what is known within the profession as the "dip", to be properly probated, after which one can become a fully permanent teacher. The students I have encountered are dying to get into the classroom and have their own class, but they must be probated before they can seek employment within the system. It is devastating for them that they cannot even get their foot in the door. We have discussed previously what is happening in the system. It is an issue across Ireland. When a teacher takes maternity leave or where a long-term substitution is required, it is not the newly qualified teacher who tends to be called immediately, but a retired teacher or somebody well known to the school. The problem is that the new teachers who need to get into the system to be probated and have the chance to be more employable are not given that opportunity. I wish to put this on the record of the House and to discuss with the Minister ways of overcoming it. It is not necessarily simply the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills. Obviously, teacher unions, management bodies and the patrons who oversee those management bodies have a role. Nobody wants a situation where newly qualified teachers who simply want to get started on their teaching career cannot even get the most basic validation of their teaching qualification, being probated in a classroom, from which they could move on and, hopefully, get their teaching career started. Ireland is going through a difficult time and we have a difficulty in financing the type of teacher body we require. Everybody accepts and understands that the bulk of what we spend on education goes on pay. However, for the dreams and aspirations of these teachers, not even being able to get started at the first point on the scale is something that must be addressed. I look forward to the Minister's comments in that regard.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his reply. Perhaps he would expand on it. He said the Department has directed the managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones.Will the Minister indicate how successful this initiative has been? As stated, this matter could be tackled by means of a cohesive approach across the entire education system. I am sure those who work within that system would agree that we must give the best and fairest start to those commencing their careers. The Department, teachers' unions and managerial and patron bodies have a part to play. The teachers to whom I refer are seeking fairness in the context of starting out on their careers in education. We must ask whether it is fair to take into the system each year the numbers that are currently being taken in for jobs that just do not exist. Effectively, are we just training these young teachers for export? I intend no criticism of what is happening in the context of the online course. The latter has been given recognition and such recognition cannot be withdrawn. However, there must be some mechanism whereby we can control the number of teachers entering the system because otherwise these individuals will be given completely false hope. The latter has been the position with regard to those graduating from the more traditional teacher training colleges in recent years. I am interested in the Minister's response to these matters. We are trying, on a non-partisan basis across the House, to assist those who those who obtain excellent leaving certificate results - they are the best academic results achieved by people in that age group anywhere in Europe - who have decided to enter a profession in which there are difficulties and challenges and which does not necessarily offer levels of remuneration as high as those available elsewhere in the economy and who are trying to get into classrooms but who cannot even get probated. The Minister accepts the difficulties to which this matter gives rise for people. I would appreciate it if he could indicate how the managerial bodies have dealt with the request from his Department and comment on the oversupply of teachers in the system.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise the topic with my colleagues and I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for being here in person. I think the Minister will agree with all of us that this is an unbelievably appalling scenario that has played out in front of our eyes in the past number of days. In the short amount of time allotted to me, I wish to make two main points. The first relates to the independence of the inquiry that needs to take place and what happens to the report when it is given to the Ombudsman for Children. Will it be published and will we be able to dig deep into the reasons this was allowed to happen? I am willing to accept the bona fides of the gardaí and the HSE to a certain extent. I hope the Minister will agree with me that what is really at the core of this episode and circus is a pure, raw, naked and poisonous racism that lies at the heart of Irish society. This goes across the political system and into journalism, the gardaí and the HSE. We are willing to believe the worst of some of the communities that live in this land, most notably the Roma and Traveller communities. There are journalists and politicians who will not be involved in these investigations and will probably not appear in whatever report is produced on this situation who have significant questions to answer about the climate of fear and the undermining and dehumanising of communities that is taking place day in, day out in daily newspapers and our television screens that makes people in this country believe the worst of the Roma and Traveller communities and many other communities in this State. I will read out a line from a journalist from the Irish Independent who wrote a scurrilous piece about the Roma community recently. I must apologise for my language. The journalist discussed an encounter with a member of the Roma community. The article included the line "cue the usual bullshit you get from the Roma any time you challenge them – lots of spitting and evil-eye finger pointing". The article went on to state that:But if we allow the Roma, or the indigenous junkies, to completely sap our native instinct to dip into our pocket when we see someone who is in a bad way then we won't just have lost one of the better aspects of our nature. We shall have given it away.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I understand that my time is short and my colleagues want to come in. My two points relate to the independent nature of the investigation but also the responsibility of journalistic and political representatives to whom I may refer afterwards who are at the heart of this racism that is at the heart of this problem.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am not a member of the Roma community, but if I was, I would not trust anyone at the moment - the Garda, the HSE, any politician and certainly not a journalist, particularly as I would have been portrayed in recent months as some sort of subspecies, demanding of Irish society that the worst be thought of me. This is why it is so crucial that we get this investigation right. If we want the Roma community, the Traveller community or any disadvantaged or marginalised community to feel as if it belongs in this Republic, its members must see transparency and accountability. They must believe in the system and there must be a level of independence. If we get this wrong, I fear for the future of this country and the potential integration of the Roma community in this Republic. If it is happening to Roma today, it will happen to someone else tomorrow. I plead with the Minister. We could be at a crossroads in our relations with the Roma community and many other communities that live in this Republic. If they do not believe in the State's institutions and if those institutions let them down this time, we will regret it in the years to come and we will deserve all that we get.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Wrong; the Deputy told us to do so.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They should apologise.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Well, that was a disaster.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for being here to discuss again this issue of insurance companies' non-engagement with areas of the country, particularly in the city and my constituency, where householders have undergone much hassle, discomfort and, in some circumstances, displacement because of the irregularity of weather patterns over the past number of years. There have been quite a number of severe weather events over the past and this has caused considerable distress to areas across the city. What has caused even more distress, as the Minister of State will be aware, as he has been quite to the forefront in this discussion with me previously, is the non-engagement of insurance companies with these individuals. What we have done in Dublin City Council, based on the Scottish model, is establish a flood forum. The flood forum goes to local areas, deals with the particulars of the areas on an individual basis, gives advice - more than any financial support - to individual householders and talks about what could be done, what could be changed and what could be applied for. We learned yesterday at a Dublin City Council meeting, however, that when the flood forum was trying to engage with the insurance companies, it was being stonewalled. The insurance companies have no interest in engaging with them. As a result, individuals, through no fault of their own are, due to extreme circumstances, house location etc., losing their house insurance. If one has no house insurance, one cannot sell one's house and it is worthless because no prospective buyer can get a mortgage without house insurance. What we have here is a small number of individuals who are living in worthless homes because of the inability of the local authority or whoever to engage with the insurance companies who are not taking this issue seriously. It is crucially important for this small number of individuals that this be resolved. It is also crucially important, as the Minister of State will be aware, for areas like Maryfield Crescent in respect of which the local authority, through every strategic policy committee and every area committee, has accepted that €50,000 should be spent on hydraulic analysis yet city councillors are not willing to spend the money to find out the problem in order that we can rectify it, go forward and not have this issue hanging over our heads in the long term. However, the main issue is that when we establish the flood forum, we ask residents to engage with it - residents can be justifiably untrusting of any new forum that is set up if they think it is a committee or talking shop that will not have any real effect. If the forum engages with residents on the issues concerned, a level of expectation is raised and the residents think that perhaps some solutions can be found to put this issue behind them, and then the flood forum goes off and tries to engage with an insurance company and does not get anywhere. We ask citizens to engage with the process, to believe in their local authority, to understand that the OPW has a certain responsibility here as well, to talk about the issues concerned and to trust in the agents of the State so that they can finally find a long-term solution, but when that flood forum, which is an agent of Dublin City Council, goes to talks to an insurance company, there is non-engagement. As a result, there is the problem of individuals with homes that are effectively worthless. I would be interested in getting an update on the Minister of State's interaction with the insurance companies and the insurance federation. It is only reasonable that a request would be made, through the flood forum. Dublin City Council or any local authority should be able to provide proof to the insurance company of works undertaken. That should be enough for the insurance companies. The householder should be able to get on with his or her life, and not have the matter constantly hanging over his or her head. It is so serious that every time there is a black cloud residents get nervous, start worrying and think there will be a major weather event that will impact seriously on their lives again. They cannot move on; they are stuck. I ask the Minister of State to update the House and myself on his engagement with the insurance federation and individual insurance companies.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State is well aware of this issue and I appreciate his response. A flood forum has been established, residents are in need of cover and insurance companies are not engaging, and meanwhile a recommendation has been made that a hydraulic analysis be undertaken on the river in question, but it is not going ahead. We cannot have a solution for the insurance companies until a hydraulic analysis is undertaken that could identify a long-term solution. We are in a classic catch-22 situation. Insurance companies are not engaging because they have a certain understanding of the risk. We would have a better understanding of the risk if the city council agreed to spend the €50,000 that was unanimously agreed to by every councillor in Dublin City Council, yet the city council is not willing to spend the money. Where do we go from here? The residents will stay in limbo and we cannot go anywhere with this. What are the long-term ramifications of this, not only for the particular street concerned, which obviously is of importance to me in my constituency, but across the city and country? When we establish a flood forum that identifies certain solutions, what power does it have and what changes can it make? If it just descends into being effectively a talking shop that gives information, people will quickly lose interest in it. They will lose faith in it and will stop engaging with it and they may take some other route which could be much more expensive for the local authority and for the OPW in the long term.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. I wish to address two main issues. Many Members have already discussed the dangers of online gambling and that the social interaction in the bookie's shop in the main street would be replaced by a more private engagement online which, as Deputies Spring, Seán Kenny and others have already said, is particularly dangerous and worrisome. However, I wish to concentrate on where the money raised through levies on betting ends up. Anybody who takes a cursory glance at the horse and greyhound racing fund and the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act that underpins that fund will probably be surprised at the mechanisms behind it. Most people would be unaware that the levy from every bet laid on anything, including soccer, rugby and the GAA, goes directly into the horse and greyhound racing fund even though only 10% of bets placed in Ireland are on horse or greyhound racing, which is remarkable. When I discovered this a number of years ago, it struck me that this must be the most cosseted industry in the State in terms of public funding. No other sporting organisation gets this type of support; it is unbelievable. If the majority of people began to realise this they might believe we should re-evaluate this funding mechanism. Can it be justified in the new age? Can it be justified when we have such social unease, social problems such as childhood obesity, problems such as hunger among schoolchildren, anti-social behaviour and children being dragged into various different courses in their lives that are destructive? The 2001 Act introduced by the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, still rules the roost in this House and levies from all bets placed in the country go to that fund. Two years ago the fund was worth €57 million and on average the Irish Sports Council gets about half that from the State each year. I would be horrified if this new online betting levy were to go anywhere near the fund. I understand that many Deputies across the House will fundamentally disagree with me on this point. Many Deputies, including some from my party, feel very strongly about the horse racing industry and what it adds to the economy. I have heard figures of €900 million mentioned for the horse racing industry and €500 million for the greyhound racing industry. I am willing to accept those figures, and the employment and tourism that come therefrom. However, we cannot let this lie without re-evaluating it. On drilling deeper into the figures we discover that approximately 80% of the money from the horse and greyhound racing fund goes to the horse racing industry. The vast bulk of that is spent on prize money, which is much more lucrative in Ireland than elsewhere in Europe. I am led to believe - I am open to contradiction on this - that five named individuals are the main beneficiaries of that prize money and their tax status is open to plenty of controversy every year. I strongly welcome that we are regulating the industry, placing a levy on it and bring it out from the darkened bedrooms of people and into the light by focusing attention on it. If the State is to benefit from a levy on it, we need to be open and transparent as to where that money will be spent. In view of all the social ills that are caused by gambling and other excessive behaviour in society, if we are to continue to funnel such a level of levy receipts from the existing betting arrangements to the horse and greyhound racing fund, we need to have a more honest and open debate on it. We need to have an honest and open debate on sports funding and what it is for. Is it for participation of children? Is it for the betterment of society? Is it for connectivity? Is it for health and exercise? Alternatively is it for this industry? Perhaps we have not had a sufficiently open discussion on that. I welcome the Bill which is justified in its purpose. However, I would have a deep distrust of the types of individuals and companies behind this. There is a difference between a person having to go into a bookie's shop where one must engage socially and doing it in one's own bedroom. Doing it behind a computer screen using credit cards and not engaging with anyone is very dangerous and worrying, as Deputy Spring has already said. The connectivity between the levy we will receive from this and the expenditure on the other side is key to this. Like everything in Irish society and public policy, people have more belief in the taxation system and the society in which they live if they can see the connectivity between the charges they pay, including the levies placed on things and the services they get as a result. We need to be much more open and honest about the horse and greyhound racing fund, the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act that underpins it and the type of sports funding that is available. We need to have discussions with every other sporting organisation in the country as to what they need. We should not be afraid of talking honestly and truthfully to those powerful individuals in the horse and greyhound industry who may have a different point of view. I welcome the Bill, but it needs to represent the beginning of a discussion as to where our levies go, how we support sport and leisure, and with whom we are willing to talk tough.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have been working very closely with Councillor Jane Horgan Jones of Dublin City Council and Councillor Judy Dunne on Fingal County Council and with Brian McDonagh on this issue. I join Deputy Kevin Humphreys in thanking the council workers, as I know the Minister of State will too, who did excellent work on the ground over the Christmas period. The 2005 Royal Haskoning report which covered the entire northside strip of north County Dublin, going up to Clontarf, has not been fully implemented. I would like a report on its implementation. Not all of its recommendations are necessarily desirable, much of the work must be done in consultation with relevant stakeholders but it needs to be worked upon. If it had been implemented some of the damage caused would not have happened.  The main artery between Baldoyle and Portmarnock has been very badly affected and people have been flooded out of their homes, particularly the O’Rourke family there. The local authority there does not view this as a main artery but there has been huge development there since 2005 and there is a lot more development planned. I would like the Minister of State and his Department to assess that with the local authority if he could. I echo Deputy Kevin Humphreys’ comments about the insurance companies. We have discussed flood insurance many times and its effect on the householder and the collapse in value of the property. It is of key importance that the Minister of State engage with the Irish Insurance Federation as improvements are made and investment comes on line, to keep it informed of improvements day by day and so that its members reflect them in their dealings with individual householders. This will not go away. It will recur year after year because of climate change. We have to work together to find a long-term solution to it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Justifiably.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, for being present. I express my intense irritation at having to come here to raise a Topical Issue on which I tabled a parliamentary question last week to which I received a one line answer. It is not the best use of my time, that of the Minister of State or the Department to have to draft a memo when such matters could be readily dealt with by furnishing me, an elected representative, with a half-decent answer a little longer than one sentence. I have come to the national Parliament to raise what is effectively a local issue. I would not have to engage in a 12 minute debate in the national Parliament on an issue affecting a housing estate beside a hospital with regard to a helicopter landing site if I had been furnished with a half-decent answer by the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, or the Department, but that is where we are. Last January Beaumont Hospital made a statement on helicopter landings adjacent to it. It stated the football pitch at Our Lady of Mercy College, Beaumont would be used as a landing pad for the air ambulance service and that the initiative would be trialled over the following 12 months. It stated approximately six landings per year were envisaged, with no increase in the number of patients transferring to the hospital. It also stated the national aeromedical co-ordination centre, NACC, would manage the activation of the helipad and that the control centre dispatched Air Corps and Irish Coast Guard helicopters in support of the ambulance service for emergency calls. A reply to a parliamentary question from a Government colleague of mine which was more complete than the one with which I was furnished stated the NACC dispatched Air Corps and Irish Coast Guard helicopters for emergencies, as well as for planned and routine aeromedical transfers, which is completely different from the response given by the area manager of Dublin City Council in July 2013 who, in answer to a question tabled by Councillor Andrew Montague, stated the national ambulance service had admitted to two test runs using the grounds earlier this year and that, having proved suitable, the grounds had been used on four occasions since. The expected six uses of the service had happened by halfway through the year. It was confirmed that transfer by helicopter was less desirable than transfer by road and that the helicopter service was used only in life and death situations, which is completely different from what was stated previously about planned and routine transfers. It was also stated the service representatives had accepted planning permission had not been granted to use the sports ground as a helicopter landing pad and would examine their options in this regard. Mr. Liam Duffy, the chief executive of Beaumont Hospital, stated in a communication with a resident that he had raised concerns about safety standards for the helipad. There are various points of views from various agencies, including Dublin City Council, the management of the hospital and those running the service. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health to try to obtain clarification on how long it would be used, whether it would be used forever and whether the hospital had a plan for a permanent helipad. Nobody wants a situation where helicopters cannot be used, but the residents are asking a reasonable question as to how long it is envisaged helicopters will land in their estate. I received a one liner stating it was a HSE problem. The Minister of State knows as well as I do that Deputies can wait months for an answer from the HSE. Part of my frustration is due not only to the fact that the residents are trying to find out reasonable information, but also to the fact that have I had to come to the national Parliament to raise an issue about a small housing estate beside a hospital because the Minister for Health or the Department could not be bothered to give me more than one line. Now the Minister of State will make a four minute speech to flesh out the problem.If I had been given the text of the Minister of State's reply previously, I could have worked on it and I would not have to spend 12 minutes of my time, the Minister of State's time and the Parliament's time trying to flesh out the problem.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister of State's reply but I am sure he will agree that if I had been provided with it in response to a parliamentary question, I would not be in the House now wasting everybody's time. This is a reasonably detailed reply. It indicates that the helipad has been used on 17 occasions in the past year, although it was supposed to have been used only six times. However, that is information about which I was not aware previously and I also have an indication as to the reasons for that. If I had received this in reply to my parliamentary question, I would have been able to work on the issue, talk to residents and find out from HSE management when the helipad on this housing estate will no longer be in use and when the helipad in the hospital complex will be used again. A one-line reply to parliamentary questions such as the one I tabled shows zero respect for Members and for the people whom we are trying to represent. We are not trying to annoy anybody. I asked a genuine question about an important service that the people of the country need, that the hospital deems important and about which residents have a concern. If I had been furnished with this detailed answer previously, I would not have had to raise it as a Topical Issue. I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle affording me the opportunity to do so and I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State. However, there needs to be continuous oversight of the use of this helipad because it emerged out of nowhere and residents and people further afield have concerns about it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«One of the most important things we have in this Republic is the opportunity to vote and participate in elections. The Minister has announced that the date for the European and local elections will be 23 May. One difficulty we have in Ireland is with the disconnect between the electoral system and the population and the fact that many people do not believe politics is working for them. One point I have made previously several times relates to the crucial responsibility we have in this House to re-engage with the populace and ordinary people and ensure people recognise the connectivity between their vote and the influence politics can have over their lives. Unfortunately, what happens generally in political systems is that those who have power are those who are richer and who utilise their vote more often. The political establishment, political system or the body politic tends to move around these circles. I have done some research on the matter and spoken to people who are politically involved in Australia. What is interesting about the political system in Australia is they have had compulsory voting for a long time. The interesting thing about electioneering in Australia is that campaigning happens in the poorest of areas and the richest of areas, it happens with the youngest people and the oldest people. Politics does not generate itself around middle class people who are middle aged, simply because they seem to have all the voting power. It goes everywhere, everyone feels empowered by it, everyone connects with it and everyone feels as if the politician or the political class will listen to what they have to say. We do not have that in Ireland. What we will have in four months' time is an election in which the majority of people will not participate. Average voting rates in general elections are higher, but in European and local elections the rate is rather low. Why is that? It is because people take the view either that politics is not working for them or they have no connectivity with what the European Union does for them. They do not necessarily have connectivity with what the local council does for them either. What we have now is an opportunity, perhaps, given that we are in such turmoil politically, socially and economically, with this election to highlight to the people the importance and power of their participation. Those who know the power of their vote use it and tend to have more power and those who do not know or do not appreciate the importance of the franchise tend to lose out. I know this from the areas I represent and where I have worked extensively over the years. Certain people lose out because they do not vote in the same numbers. If people do not vote in the same numbers, politicians realise it and they know it is worthwhile to spend more time in an area where people vote rather than an area where people do not, or they will spend more time with a group of people who vote rather than a group of people who do not. I have in mind members of the Traveller community and immigrants. Such groups are often easy prey for politicians to criticise because they do not have the same voting power bloc others may have. How are we going to re-engage with the people? How do we put it to them that the European Union is important and that, whatever their view of it and what has unfolded in recent years, it certainly has a major influence over all our lives? Why do half the people in Ireland not bother to show up and vote on election day? We should have a proper conversation not only about our connectivity with the European Union but about what type of European Union we want. I hope we can have an ideologically driven debate because too often this becomes a referendum on the Government or it becomes about tribal politics. What is our vision for the European Union? What kind of value system do we believe it should espouse? More important, how can the electoral commission that will potentially emerge from the Constitutional Convention ensure we reconnect with people who are so disconnected that either they do not care or they simply do not want to know? Given these powerful forces that engage in these decisions which affect all our lives, why is it that people are so turned off by the European Union or by elections in general? It is our responsibility to step up to the mark and this is a chance for us to do so. This is the first election in this governmental term to ask these questions of ourselves and perhaps to provide some answers for the future.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Fianna Fáil councillors rezoned those areas.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the opportunity to speak on the current situation in Northern Ireland and on the recent work that has been undertaken by the Government and, in particular, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in seeking a successful resolution to the talks chaired by Dr. Richard Haass. It is with a sense of regret that I point out that almost 20 years since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires, 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement and seven years since the restoration of the Assembly and Executive in 2007, over the past 18 months, negative events in Northern Ireland have come back on the political agenda. Whether it is ongoing paramilitary activity by dissident groups, protests over flags and parades and related disturbances, dealing with the legacy of the past through books and television programmes on collusion, the publication of the Smithwick tribunal report or the ongoing search for the disappeared, matters relating to tension in Northern Ireland have been to the fore. Regarding the latter issue, I, along with several colleagues in the parliamentary Labour Party, Deputies Nash, Wall and Dowds, travelled to Belfast last November, where we were privileged and humbled to meet the relatives of the disappeared. Their courage and dignity in their ongoing search for the remains of their loved ones who were abducted and murdered by the IRA during the Troubles stands in contrast to the callous cowardice of their killers, as well as the embarrassing denials by the leadership of Sinn Féin that they had any hand, act or part in these events. We also told the families that the Labour Party would be proud to facilitate the bringing of their simple and moving exhibition on the disappeared, which we visited in Belfast City Hall, to public spaces and civic centres across Ireland so that people do not forget one of the saddest outstanding legacies of the Troubles. I am glad to inform the House that their exhibition will open in Drogheda next Monday, facilitated by my colleague, Deputy Nash, where it will be on display for a number of weeks. Family members of those whose remains have not yet been found will be in attendance. I have requested the Lord Mayor of Dublin to facilitate this exhibition in the capital. With regard to the Smithwick report, I want to place on record my support for the apology given to the Breen and Buchanan families by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last December. It was not easy for those of us who abhorred the violence of the IRA during the years of the Troubles to hear that agencies of this State were culpable in the murder of the two RUC men. In particular, it was a difficult day for an Garda Síochána. I commend the manner in which the Garda Commissioner acknowledged the report's findings on publication. However, it was important the Government took a leadership role in fulfilling the commitments it gave to have an open, honest and transparent investigation into the murders of the two men. Following publication of the report, it was fully appropriate for the Tánaiste to offer the apology that he gave. The type of courage he displayed in doing so must be replicated by others. In this I include paramilitaries from either side, as well as the British Government regarding activities by the British State and its agencies during the Troubles. The Government has led; others must now follow. It was significant that both the Breen and Buchanan families welcomed the Tánaiste’s apology with great dignity. For too long, the needs of the victims of the Troubles have come second to the understandable need to keep the political process on track. One of the positives to be taken from the Haass process, however, is the significant progress made on dealing with the outstanding legacy of the past. The final Haass document is 40 pages long; dealing with the past takes up 50% of that. There was considerable agreement among the political parties on this section. I welcome this development and urge the two Governments to safeguard the extensive agreement that was reached. There are some in Northern Ireland who would like simply to wish the past away or draw a line under some of its horrific events. It is possible to do so. If we are to have a fully reconciled society in Northern Ireland, however, then we have to deal with the past. I pay tribute to those political parties, in particular the SDLP, which have over recent years argued that the needs of victims and their families have to be dealt with. This is supported by the Labour Party and we continue to support the efforts of groups seeking the truth. A Labour Party delegation met the Ballymurphy families in Belfast last November. We welcome the support that was given to them by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government last week. Similarly, the Labour Party continues to support the call for an independent inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane and encourages the Tánaiste to continue to raise this with his British counterpart at every opportunity. In saying this, I pay tribute to the Tánaiste for the work he has put into seeking agreement in Northern Ireland over recent months. While in recent years the Irish and British Governments largely gave the political parties in the North the time and space to sort out local issues under devolution, in response to recent events there has been a clear need for the two Governments to reassert their roles as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement. I know the Tánaiste devoted significant time to the Haass process - largely behind the scenes - as well as undertaking frequent visits to Belfast, Derry and Armagh. While it is regrettable that these efforts did not lead to agreement at the end of the talks process, I urge him to continue his efforts over the coming months. In particular, the effort the Government has put into the process over recent times should be reciprocated on the British side. Intergovernmental co-operation remains an important element of the process. I know that the Tánaiste has developed a positive working relationship with the UK’s Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There may be a need for increased activity by the two Governments over the next several weeks and months to keep the process moving. I urge all parties in this House to give their support to the two Governments in this regard. Traditionally there has been a large amount of consensus among the main political parties in Dáil Éireann on the political process in Northern Ireland. It has been an unspoken rule that we do not play party politics with the peace process. Regrettably, over recent times, this consensus has been broken. Earlier in this debate, I heard an extremely partisan speech by the Fianna Fáil leader, Deputy Martin. His unhelpful criticisms of the Government were consistent with his recent remarks in which he has tried to score political points rather than support the process.I point out to Deputy Martin that many of the issues with which the political parties in the Executive and Assembly and the two Governments were dealing in the Haass talks were live when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was not able to get agreement then and he should know better than to snipe from the sidelines now. He knows the failure to extend the remit of the North-South bodies or regarding the construction of the Narrow Water bridge in Louth is not down to the Irish Government. Rather, it is down to opposition within the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland. I support fully the development of both and we in the Labour Party will continue to work in whatever way we can to advance both these projects. In conclusion, I welcome this opportunity to speak on Northern Ireland and hope there will be further opportunities to speak as the process continues over the coming months. Many issues remain unresolved that have an impact on all of us who live on the island, just as they do on the population in the North. I thank the Tánaiste for his work to date and pledge the Labour Party's full support for the period ahead.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They were delighted.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I must apologise for my voice which has been affected by some dental work, but I will try to struggle through. I wish to raise the important issue of the new referral procedure for children in the north side of Dublin to the Mater child and adolescent mental health service. Mater CAMHS deals with the mental health needs of children aged from birth to 16 in Dublin North-Central. Sixteen and 17 year olds are also continuing to use the service. Dublin postcodes 1, 3 and parts of 7, 9, 11 and 6, Dublin North-West, Glasnevin and part of Cabra are also covered. The services provided are psychiatry, clinical psychology, social work, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, administration, registrars in child psychiatry, trainees and students in all disciplines.  The referral process is for children from birth to 16 years with persistent mental health problems such as emotional, behavioural, developmental and other psychiatric disorders. It also concerns problems that impact on functioning at home, in school or in relationships that have not been resolved by primary care level intervention, including the National Educational Psychological Service. We are talking about deliberate self-harm, suicidal thinking, depression, mood disorder, complex and severe anxiety, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, significant emotional and behavioural difficulties, post-traumatic stress disorder, complex behavioural problems, conduct disorder, complex behavioural response, psychosis, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and complex developmental problems. Local school principals dealing with these very vulnerable children in an acutely disadvantaged area, which is the team A area in Dublin North-Central, are being told they can only get referrals to use the Mater CAMHS service through their local general practitioner. Children in Dublin 2 or 4 can therefore be referred by their local school principal, but children in Dublin 1 and 3 have to go through their GP. This is completely unfair, unwarranted and unnecessary. We are asking school principals to bring a parent and child to their local GP before they can make an essential and sometimes immediate intervention to save a child's mental health or potentially save a child's life. People working within the service are saying this is completely unworkable. Why is a child in Dublin 1 being treated differently from a child in Dublin 2 or 4? The referral process should be uniform throughout the system. Will the Minister ensure principals in the team A area for Mater CAMHS will continue to be allowed to refer vulnerable children to this most important service?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his response. I note he said that "the service can confirm that in advance of its referral criteria being brought in line with national policy, it will continue to consider all referrals, including those from schools". The problem though is that the Mater CAMHS is telling local school principals something different. While people within the service are quietly telling principals that they think this is unworkable and they want the previous criteria to remain, the Minister's message and the message local principals are getting from Mater CAMHS are two very different things. I ask the Minister to ensure local schools dealing with these vulnerable children are aware they can still refer such children to the local Mater CAMHS and that the situation has not changed. Will the Minister also communicate that to the service itself? We do not want mixed messages to be coming from the Minister and the local Mater CAMHS. According to a presentation for principals by that service, the HSE is recommending that referrals come through the local GP. Two very different messages are coming out here, so we need clarity. We are dealing with very vulnerable children in serious situations who will potentially need life-saving interventions.We cannot play around with words in the circumstances. Principals and school communities need to know what protections they have and what line of responsibility they have. Mixed messages from CAMHS or the Department do not help. If the Minister could clarify the matter or ensure that it is clarified, it would be deeply appreciated.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Why do I have confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter? I have confidence in the way he is closing St. Patrick's Institution for Young Offenders and ending slopping out in Mountjoy Prison. I have confidence in the way he has criminalised forced labour and his belief in equality, especially in the areas of women's health and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, rights in the workplace and society. I have confidence in the legislation he introduces, especially in the area of personal insolvency, and his decision to introduce a Garda authority. However, some of my confidence in the Minister has been shaken by the handling of this issue in recent months, the matter of direct provision centres, the potential of the legal services Bill to prevent top barristers and solicitors taking on pro bono work because of the multidisciplinary structures it will apply and the delay in properly recognising Traveller ethnicity. Much work remains to be done and more reform is needed. While I have confidence that the Minister can achieve this, some areas need his urgent attention.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What is the status of the legislation regarding collective bargaining? Also, what is the Government's position on the proposed financial transaction tax which is being discussed Europe-wide this week?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was extremely supportive of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2013, which was introduced in the Seanad last year. When will the Bill, the purpose of which is to ensure that State employees of religious-run institutions will have the same rights as all other employees, be introduced in this House?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Cabinet has approved legislation on collective bargaining? Will he indicate when the relevant Bill will be introduced?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue of direct provision centres has been troubling many people for quite a while. During the recent controversy about mother and baby homes, I came to the conclusion that there has always been a view in Ireland that some children are somehow lesser children. This cannot be dismissed as something that happened in the past. It is clear from the way Irish society views Roma children, Traveller children or poor children in general that it sees some children as lesser children than others. It is very difficult not to agree with this conclusion when one examines the way the State deals with children who are in direct provision centres. As the Minister knows, these centres were designed as a six-month solution for asylum seekers on their arrival in Ireland. We have 35 of these centres in the Republic. Given that three of them were purpose built, it is clear that most of the time we are talking about hostels or other such unsuitable accommodation. The weekly allowance received by asylum seekers in direct provision centres is €19.10. The payment in the case of children is €9.60. This amount has not changed for 14 years. Some 59% of all residents have been in direct provision for more than three years. I remind the House that the initial intention was that this would be a six-month solution. Some 31% of residents have been in direct provision for more than five years and 9% for more than seven years. The number of people we are talking about - approximately 4,300, some 1,700 of whom are children - is higher than the State's prison population. The inspection regime in these centres is managed by the Reception and Integration Agency, which I understand outsources a substantial number of health and safety inspections to the private sector. I do not think this is good enough. Responsibility for overseeing the health and mental well-being of 1,700 children should be given to an agency like the Health Information and Quality Authority. It is inevitable that 50 years from now, people will look damningly at this Republic and this Government for the way we have treated and accommodated these children. Do we have a policy on how to move from the current direct provision scandal? Will we commit to putting in place a system that will allow families to move on, for example, by guaranteeing them a definite decision on their status within six months? Why are we overseeing a system that can cause a child to spend seven or nine years in a direct provision centre? Do we view the children who live in these centres, many of whom are Irish born, as members of society and citizens of the Republic? Are they seen as lesser children with lesser rights under this Republic, just as the children in the mother and baby homes were seen back in the day? Obviously, the Minister has an intimate understanding of this situation due to her previous role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Now that she has been appointed as Minister for Justice and Equality, she is ideally placed to rid this Republic of this scandal. There will come a time when we will know about the long-term damage and mental trauma caused by requiring children to live their lives in this limbo. Articles will be written about this issue and the Dáil record will be investigated. When these arrangements come back to haunt us in years to come, people will ask what this Government did about them. Regardless of what previous Governments did and irrespective of who established these centres in the first place, deep and challenging questions will be asked about what we did at this time to resolve this situation. I will conclude by repeating my fundamental questions. Are we going to commit to reverting to the six-month understanding? Will we transfer the inspection regime to a more suitable agency, such as HIQA?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her reply, which shows she is well aware of the realities of the direct provision system and the challenges they present. The fact that she has visited a centre gives me great hope that she will be in a good position to address the problems in the system. Nevertheless, I hold fast to the view that the subcontracting out of the inspection regime to the private sector does not offer sufficient protections and that it should be brought under the auspices of the Health Information and Quality Authority. It is clear that the Minister recognises what needs to be done to tackle this issue, including the necessary legislative changes. Moreover, she seems keenly aware of the damage caused when children spend years in these types of settings. There is no requirement to for that point to be reinforced. Will the Minister indicate the type of timeline she envisages for the legislative measures to which she referred? Can she give a commitment that we will revisit this issue in a structured and timetabled fashion rather than discussing it on the basis of media reports or by way of a Topical Issue debate or parliamentary question? Will she give a further undertaking to the House that in the time left to this Government, be it two years or less, reform of the direct provision system will be a priority? We should be able, at the end of our term in government, to say we have made solid progress for the sake of the children and families involved. We should be in a position to point to the steps we have taken and the results achieved.  We should at least be able to say we did that much for these vulnerable children. These children are not lesser. They are living in this Republic, and that means something. After all that has happened in this country, we have a deep understanding of the trauma and long-term damage that can be done to children if there is not a proper focus on their social, emotional and educational needs at this vulnerable time in their lives. To summarise, I am asking the Minister to elaborate on the potential for HIQA to step in as inspector and, second, to give a timetable for nailing down the improvements in this area which the Minister is clearly committed to driving forward.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Mine was about the climate change Bill, which the Minister has already addressed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«During the bubble period, when the State was overly reliant on stamp duty and VAT as a source of income, people in Dublin and the commuter belt contributed disproportionately to the coffers of the State. It would be extremely unfair if they emerge from that situation to a new one in which they are doubly punished because of property prices in Dublin and the local property charge. Council services benefit the most vulnerable and poorest in our society, whether through housing, sheltered accommodation, libraries, parks or playgrounds. All of the essential services that councils provide benefit the poorest and most vulnerable, who have the greatest need for public services. The suggestion that central government grants to Dublin City Council or any of the other Dublin councils could be affected because of receipts from the local property tax is patently unfair. Given the historical context of what happened during the bubble period, the bankrupt nature of the funding mechanism and the fact that Dubliners were unfairly treated during that period, to disadvantage those living in the Dublin region by cutting central government funds is doubly unfair. Dublin has a higher proportion of marginalised and disadvantaged communities who depend on council services for their very survival. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to ensure they are not cut off from central government.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Last year, Dublin City Council scraped its budget through and last minute proposals from city management in regard to cutting homelessness services and adaptation grants for the disabled and potential increases of 14% in local authority rents were avoided because of an intervention from the Government. Without ongoing and sustainable intervention by the Government, the services that protect the most vulnerable in Dublin will not survive. This is a matter of equality and social solidarity.It is important to underpin the essential services of housing, community infrastructure, library services, etc., with sustainable funding. This should come from the local property tax, which I support, and also from the central government to ensure such services can continue in future without a threat hanging over them from year to year.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is scaremongering.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, is in the Chamber because we are both happy to talk about something that matters rather than talking about Garth Brooks, as we have been doing the whole day. I work closely with Age Action Ireland in my constituency. I have a number of senior citizens fora and Age Action Ireland attends regularly. It tells local people about its care and repair programmes, which are of great benefit, and it does a lot of sound work. However, it got it wrong with this campaign. The campaign has unnecessarily worried people and got them frightened.They know how important their travel pass and independence are to them. They value that independence and the very suggestion that it would be interfered with scared them. I believe Age Action Ireland was mistaken in embarking on this campaign, because there was never a threat to this scheme. At this juncture, considering that the Ministers for Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport have said there is no threat to this scheme, this debate should stop now, the motion should be withdrawn and we should debate something genuinely important. It is important to discuss the concept of universality. Often we can be quite complacent about some of our social infrastructure and the reason for it. We will have a debate soon on free GP care for children under six and some people will say it is unnecessary for people of a certain income bracket to have or avail of social infrastructure or supports like this. However, if we live in and believe in the essence of a republic, services such as free travel passes, free GP care or free education for everybody are constants we cannot lose sight of, even in straitened times. I had a meeting with Dublin Bus recently and was told that the €75 million it gets from the social protection budget is vital to the survival of Dublin Bus as a public transport entity in the city. Therefore, it would be nonsense to suggest this investment from the Department of Social Protection would be interfered with. I must touch on the issue of Fianna Fáil hypocrisy, because this issue is being used by Fianna Fáil as a political football to scare people who are terrified their travel pass may be interfered with. I remind the House that if the Government had followed the four-year plan as laid out by Fianna Fáil when it signed up with the IMF, we would have seen €1.7 billion more in cuts to the social protection budget. In that scenario, it would have been practically impossible to maintain essential services such as the travel pass. Fianna Fáil should be grateful the Government did not follow its four-year plan and that €1.7 billion extra was not taken from the social protection budget. As a result, schemes like the travel pass can be maintained. I thank the Ministers for their clarity on this issue. There has been no ambiguity. Their language has been straightforward and there has been no obfuscation or clever use of language. Ministers from across the spectrum, involved in transport and social protection, have been categorical that there is no need for this motion and there is no threat to the travel pass. It stayed for the past three years and stayed under the previous Administration. Therefore, there is no point in discussing the issue further.  The best thing for Fianna Fáil to do is to apologise for raising the fears of senior citizens and apologise for the tone of its motion and withdraw it on foot of the categorical statements given by the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Fianna Fáil should also thank the Government, on the basis that by not following the Fianna Fáil plan, the social protection budget is more intact than it would have been if Fianna Fáil had remained in power.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Aiken Promotions is having a laugh.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is against it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Just like Garth Brooks did.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Fianna Fáil did nothing about social housing.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputies for their kind remarks on my appointment. I welcome the opportunity to speak on disability services and to outline the extent of this Government's commitment to people with disabilities. I commend my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her single minded commitment to achieving a better and fairer outcome for people with disabilities. This goal is also relevant to me in my new role as Minister of State with responsibility for equality. My objective until the end of this Government's term is to set out the equality agenda not only as a societal need, but also as an economic need. As has been noted on all sides of the House this evening, countries that are more equal do better. There was a perception in the past in this country and most other jurisdictions that people with disabilities should adapt themselves to society. It is important to restate what the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said last Tuesday, namely, people with disabilities are not ill and do not need to be fixed. Thankfully, there is now recognition that society needs to change. People with disabilities must be supported as full and equal citizens of this country who participate in Irish society on the same basis as any other citizen. This principle is at the heart of the Government's approach to issues affecting those with disabilities. As Deputy Maloney correctly pointed out, no side of this House has a monopoly of wisdom in this regard. Tremendous work has already been done to improve supports for families, provide early intervention services, streamline access to therapy services for children and provide dedicated resources for children with special education needs, an area close to my own heart. Ten years ago the special education budget amounted to approximately €450 million. At the height of the boom in 2009 it was €750 million. Now it is approximately €1.3 billion, or 15% of the entire education budget. At the end of this year, nearly 11,000 special needs assistants will be working in the Irish education system, which is more than ever, and the number of special classes has increased by 60% since the 2010-11 academic year. We still face challenges, however. For example, in the context of an increase of 2% in the student intake last year, the number of students with special educational needs increased by 11%. As students progress to adulthood, disability services are being transformed. We are moving towards the delivery of a person centred model of support whereby people with disabilities are no longer the passive recipients of an often segregated service but instead have more control over their own lives. We are also rationalising administrative processes to make services more effective, efficient and responsive. One example is the success achieved this year in the provision of life skills training and day supports for school leavers with disabilities. The Government's commitment to implementing a comprehensive employment strategy will be a vital aspect of the whole of government approach to disability issues. The inclusion of the strategy in the Action Plan for Jobs and the subsequent monitoring through the Cabinet committee of Pathways to Work reinforces the principle of mainstreaming. This is a central tenet of the national disability strategy and it means that issues which affect people with disability should be addressed by the public bodies which have responsibility for these issues. Deputies Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, Michael Wallace and Clare Daly referred to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This is a priority for me. I understand that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, which is awaiting Committee Stage, will deal with most of the issues that hinder ratification. Further legislation will be needed to deal with other issues, such as reasonable accommodation, but most of what needs to be done has already been scoped out. I expect to bring proposals to Government on further necessary legislation in the next six months. The necessary consultation with relevant Departments is under way and should be finalised shortly.  Speakers on all sides of the House raised the issue of funding for advocacy groups. I will take on board the comments made and commit to the House that I will discuss the matters raised with the Minister of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. Services are provided to people with disabilities across many areas of government. New developments in housing and employment activation show that the Government is pushing out the boundaries to enable people with disabilities to participate more fully in society. Funding provided to programmes outside the health budget, in addition to the HSE's annual expenditure of €1.4 billion, enables people with disabilities to avail of an extensive range of financial supports and services. The challenge for all of us will be to ensure this funding is used to best effect to facilitate full participation in society by people with disabilities.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following :"recognising that:- the current system of direct provision has existed for 14 years;- that the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, having visited several centres, both agree on the need to review the current system; and- a key concern identified by those working in the sector is the length of time people spend in the system, with over half of residents being in the system for over four years;welcomes the commitments in the statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016 to:- establish an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements with the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers; and- to reduce the length of time the applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single applications procedure, to be introduced by way of a protection Bill as a matter of priority.I genuinely welcome the motion from Deputy Thomas Pringle and the Technical Group. I appreciate his sentiments in this regard.  I welcome the opportunity to speak about the system of direct provision because, as made clear in the new statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016, the Government is committed to addressing not only the issues arising in relation to the system of direct provision but also the issues which need to be addressed in the context of the wider protection process. The statement of Government priorities contains a number of interconnected commitments in the area of international protection for this purpose. These include the commitment to legislate to reduce the length of time an applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single application procedure by way of a dedicated protection Bill; and the commitment to establish an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements in the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. The single protection procedure we will put in place will ensure Ireland continues to meet its international obligations and in a way which is both efficient and fair. This reform will simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the direct provision system and the costs to the taxpayer. That will equally allow us to address issues which now arise in the context of the system of dispersal and direct provision. It is no secret that I have been and continue to be a critic of the direct provision system as it currently operates. I want to see it reformed into something of which we can be proud in a civilised society that describes itself as a republic. I have described the system as inhumane and intolerable and I refuse to stand over it in its current form. I am particularly mindful of the position of families and children. We need to ensure the facilities we have in place are capable of meeting the needs of families in circumstances where their cases are ongoing for protracted periods. We need to ensure, in particular, that the length of time people are spending in the system does not mean that children's only experience of life is of life in the direct provision system. The needs of children will be a key issue to be addressed in the reform of the system. Therefore, I want change. In particular, I want to see changes made to the system in the short term which will have a direct benefit for those residing in centres as quickly as possible. That is why I very much look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and my other colleagues in government in taking forward these commitments in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality. The motion appears to acknowledge that change cannot occur overnight and I welcome this. We need to be sure the changes we make are ones we are capable of delivering on and sustaining into the future. We also need to take account of the fact that the system of direct provision does not operate in isolation from the overall protection process and that it is important that we address all relevant issues in the context of that process as a whole. There are lessons to be learned from the circumstances in which the system of direct provision and dispersal were introduced and it is important that we do not lose sight of this. Direct provision was the public policy response to a major accommodation crisis at the time. We must be careful not to create a new one in circumstances where there are already considerable pressures in the housing market. The Government introduced the system in 1999 in response to an increase in the number of persons applying for asylum, which rose to 7,724 in that year from a figure of 424 only four years previously. That upward trend and the concentration of asylum seekers in the Dublin area meant that the accommodation services there were, understandably, unable to cope. The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, was consequently established to put in place arrangements which would enable the accommodation needs of protection seekers arriving in the State to be met. The direct provision system has, nonetheless, succeeded in the period since in meeting the housing and other immediate needs of over 51,000 asylum seekers. No one has ever been turned away or left homeless. The difficulty is that a short-term emergency measure has become long-term policy.  The system of direct provision and dispersal has also enabled the housing, education and health needs of asylum seekers to be met in a manner which has avoided overburdening services in Dublin and other urban areas. It has in this way facilitated the mainstreaming of these services for asylum seekers, ensured they access the same services and that their children attend the same schools as their peers in the communities in which they live. We need to ensure these beneficial aspects of the system are preserved. The system of direct provision has shown itself capable of responding in a flexible way as the number of asylum seekers arriving in the State has ebbed and flowed. The number of persons residing in direct provision accommodation peaked at 8,080 in 2005. The decline since has meant that the number of direct provision centres has fallen from over 70 to the 34 now in operation. The most recent closure took place in July 2013. The annual budget for direct provision accommodation, at its highest, in 2008, exceeded €91 million. This year the cost will be approximately €51 million, a reduction of 40%. The number now in direct provision accommodation is approximately 4,300 which represents a reduction of 3,780 persons or 46% compared with the high point. The numbers residing in direct provision accommodation reflect, in part, the number of asylum applications being made. The number of applications had increased from the low hundreds in the early 1990s to 7,724 in 1999 when the decision to introduce the system of direct provision was made and was later to peak at 11,634 in 2002. The number of asylum applications has declined in the period since, reaching 946 last year. The numbers of asylum seekers presenting themselves can clearly have implications for processing times, as well as the nature of the accommodation that can be provided. That is why it is important that we consolidate the improvements made in recent times in processing times. The reducing numbers being accommodated in the system also offer the possibility of improving conditions for everyone. The average length of time persons spend in the direct provision system has been increasing year on year for some time and is a particular issue of concern to the Government, as well as to me. There are, however, many reasons this is so. An analysis undertaken earlier this year revealed that approximately 50% of persons in the direct provision system had either judicial review applications pending, were the subject of deportation orders, or were seeking leave to remain in the State for non-protection reasons. A recent examination of cases in the direct provision system suggested that, in the overwhelming majority of cases in the system longer than four years, the applicants or their family members had legal proceedings pending, having exhausted all of the processes in the protection system. I mention these facts for the purpose of setting out the context for the work we have to do, not in any way to apologise for the system as it is constituted. That also explains why we have decided to proceed by way of the establishment of an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements to the protection process as a whole, as well as the system of direct provision and supports for asylum seekers, in particular. The necessary work for the purpose of establishing the working group is well under way.  Both the Minister and I hosted a round-table consultation on 18 September. The round-table discussion brought together a wide range of organisations that have been working in the field of refugees and asylum seekers or have a particular perspective to bring to their needs. I take the opportunity to thank the Irish Refugee Council for its assistance in organising the round-table discussion. The groups represented were the Irish Refugee Council, as well as a representative of its core group of asylum seekers and refugees, AkiDwA, Cultúr, Doras Luimní, the Jesuit Refugee Service, Mayo Intercultural Action, NASC, SPIRASI, Tralee International Resource Centre, the Crosscare Migrant and Refugee Project, Dublin Aids Alliance, BeLonG To Youth, Children's Rights Alliance, FLAG, Barnardos and the Integration Centre. Representatives of the UNHCR and Amnesty also attended. Both the Minister and I benefited greatly from their insights into the operation of the direct provision system.  The main purpose of the round-table discussion was to enable the groups to outline key issues for them concerning the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers and the direct provision system. The outcome of the round-table discussion has helped to clarify the issues the working group will need to address.The results of the round-table consultation will inform in more detail the terms of reference of the working group, which the Minister will announce shortly along with the membership of the group. The working group is to be chaired by former High Court judge and presiding officer of our citizenship ceremonies Bryan MacMahon.
I expect that the membership will include representation from a wide range of interests in this area and include NGOs, advocacy groups working with children and other vulnerable people, refugees and representatives from all relevant Departments that have a role to play in providing supports and services to protection applicants. The Minister's intention is that the working group will be asked to submit a first report to the Government by the end of the year.  In advance of the round-table consultation, we had already identified a number of indicative themes with a view to guiding the discussion without limiting those contributing to those themes. These were the material needs of applicants in direct provision, including the direct provision allowance and exceptional needs payments; the needs of families and persons with special needs in direct provision, with reference to the accommodation portfolio; the arrangements for handling complaints and inspections; how linkages with local communities can be improved; support for residents when transitioning to life in the community; whether limitations should be placed on the length of time persons spend in direct provision; supports for protection applicants, including in regard to education, training, health care, social welfare entitlements and access to employment; and issues relating to the international protection determination process. The final remit of the working group will now be determined in the light of the outcome of the round-table consultation. This will ensure that all relevant issues are approached in a structured and considered way. There is a sovereign requirement for Ireland to maintain balanced and appropriate immigration controls while at the same time ensuring that those who come to our shores to seek the protection of our State are dealt with fairly, humanely, expeditiously and in accordance with both domestic and EU law and rules. As a country and a people, we can justifiably say we are playing our part in this respect. Over the past 14 years or so, close to 40,000 immigrants who came here and utilised our protection and related processes have been allowed to remain in the State on a permanent basis. Indeed, very many of these have proceeded to become Irish citizens.  We will, of course, continue to honour our solemn international duty in the area of protection. However, we do not have limitless resources and we simply cannot operate an immigration policy which leaves us open to being targeted by those who trade in human misery, no more than we are in a position to provide for the vast number of economic migrants who seek a better life. It would be wrong for us to pretend otherwise or to offer simplistic solutions to what are truly complex and difficult issues of public policy with which governments all over Europe are struggling to grapple.  The statement of Government priorities also includes a second key commitment, which is to legislate to reduce the time an applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single application procedure by way of a dedicated protection Bill. This is a key Government priority as it will be essential to removing structural delays, which are a feature of the existing protection system. Work on the Bill has already commenced. We are aiming to publish it in January 2015 with a view to its enactment by Easter next year. The key purpose of the Bill is to establish a single applications procedure and, as I indicated, simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. It will mean that all aspects of protection - asylum and subsidiary protection – in addition to any non-protection grounds that may prevent the Minister from deporting a person in the event of protection being refused, will be investigated and decided upon at the same time. It will, as a consequence, reduce the time that applicants spend in the direct provision system.  There has been some comment on the single procedure being of no benefit to persons already in the system. The benefit of a single procedure would not necessarily be limited to new applicants. The introduction of a single procedure for new applicants would raise the question as to what extent the new procedure could be applied to cases already in the system. The details in that regard are currently being examined in my Department.  I would like in closing to refer to some recent events. As Deputies will be aware, there are a number of ongoing protests in direct provision centres around the country. I fully respect the right of residents to protest and express their concerns about the living conditions or the protection process. At the same time, I am concerned about the impact the protests can have on children and other vulnerable persons living in the centres. Other aspects of the protests have been quite disquieting. These have included the targeting of individuals working in certain direct provision centres and the stopping of people going about their work. I know from my visits to the centres that the persons working there, in addition to those in the Reception and Integration Agency, are working on a day-to-day basis in the interests of the residents and bring real commitment to their work that often goes far beyond what is required of them. I would not like to see the good relationships that exist in most centres undermined. Issues outside the control of the Reception and Integration Agency and local centre management, such as the time spent in centres and the right to employment, are issues that will be addressed by the working group which is being established. Direct provision, as the motion makes clear, has existed for 14 years now. It is not something that can simply be wished away or ended immediately. The Government has also to take account of the broader context of the challenging picture in regard to the public finances and the competing demands on them. The Government is nevertheless committed to change and to bringing about real improvements to the protection process and the arrangements in place for accommodating asylum seekers. That is why we will be tasking the working group to report back to the Government within a very tight timeframe. We have form in this regard. We pledged to end the degrading practice of slopping out in Mountjoy and we did so. We pledged to close St. Patrick's Institution for Young Offenders and we have done so. We will not be found wanting in respect of direct provision. I ask the House to allow the working group the time to undertake that work and to support the Government’s counter-motion. 
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I propose to report to the Dáil on the Government's response to the sixth report of the Constitutional Convention, which proposes the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. The convention was established by Government in 2012 to consider a range of issues on which constitutional change may be needed and to report on its conclusions to the Houses of the Oireachtas. This House approved the convention's terms of reference and the issues to be considered. The latter include the removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution, which is the subject of the convention's sixth report. The Government welcomes the sixth report of the Convention on the Constitution and thanks it and its members for their high level of engagement. The Government accepts the main recommendation contained in the report, namely, that a referendum should be held on removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. Members will recall that the guarantee relating to freedom of expression in Article 40.6.1°(i) of the Constitution also includes, by way of limit to the general guarantee, a sentence providing that publishing or uttering blasphemous material is to be a criminal offence punishable by law. The crime of blasphemy under common law referred to material insulting to the State-established - that is, Church of Ireland - religion. In the Corway case in 1999, the Supreme Court underlined that the constitutional reference to an offence of blasphemy could not be interpreted in such a narrow sense and would have to be understood in a manner appropriate to "the circumstances of a modern State which embraces citizens of many different religions, and which guarantees freedom of conscience and a free profession and practice of religion." The Supreme Court added that it was for the Legislature to define how this would operate in practice. The offence of blasphemy is duly defined in section 36 of the Defamation Act 2009 as publishing or uttering material which is grossly abusive or insulting regarding matters held sacred by any religion and which intentionally causes outrage to a substantial number of that religion's adherents. There is a defence if a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic or other value in the material. The penalty on conviction is a fine not exceeding €25,000. In practice, there have been no prosecutions under the 2009 Act and the last public prosecution for blasphemy in Ireland appears to have been brought in 1855. The convention devoted its seventh plenary meeting, held on 2 and 3 November 2013, to the question of whether the Constitution should be amended to remove the offence of blasphemy. The convention's report indicates that it received very many submissions on this issue. It notes that the submissions suggested a very high level of support for removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution and that it is clear that this issue is regarded by many of those who made submissions as forming part of a much wider debate, including the role of religion in the Constitution and the relationship between religion and the State. The convention reports that, in keeping with its general principles of fairness and efficiency, it sought to present the fullest possible range of perspectives to its participants both for and against retaining the existing text. It also heard detailed expert presentations on the origins and development of the offence of blasphemy, on its practical operation in Ireland historically and today and on how this compares with other jurisdictions. The outcome of the convention's deliberations was that a substantial majority of its members recommended that the offence of blasphemy should be removed from the Constitution, with 61% of members voting in favour of removal, 38% voting against and only 1% undecided. The sixth report of the convention recommends, therefore, that the offence of blasphemy be removed from the Constitution. I am pleased to inform the House that the Government has agreed, at its meeting on 30 September, to put this question to the people and that a referendum should be held on the question of amending Article 40.6.1°(i) of the Constitution to remove the offence of blasphemy. As regards the detailed content of any constitutional or legislative change, the convention's report raises a number of further issues, namely whether the offence of blasphemy should simply be deleted from the Constitution or replaced with a new provision prohibiting incitement to religious hatred, and whether we should retain a legislative provision for the offence of blasphemy or replace this at statutory level with provisions prohibiting incitement to religious hatred. The convention voted in favour of including a new constitutional provision against religious hatred, with 53% of members in favour, 38% against and 9% undecided. There was no clear majority on whether to keep a legislative provision for the offence of blasphemy, with 49% in favour, 50% against and 1% undecided. If a legislative provision is retained, the convention favours replacing the existing offence with detailed legislative provisions against incitement to religious hatred; in this regard it voted 82% in favour, 11% against and 7% undecided. These recommendations will require more detailed legal and other consideration. For example, there is already relevant legislative provision in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, which will need to be taken into account. The Minister for Justice and Equality has been charged by the Government with the task of further examining these issues and undertaking the work necessary to prepare both a referendum Bill and another item of legislation to amend the current legislative provision for the offence of blasphemy. With regard to timing, the referendum will take place at an appropriate date to be decided by Government after the necessary further consultations have been completed and the required legislation has been prepared. I wish to take this opportunity to update the House on the overall position regarding the Government's response to the convention's reports. The convention produced nine reports in total, all of which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government has already agreed to the holding of three referendums in 2015 on foot of the convention's first three reports. These referendums will be on reducing the voting age, reducing the age of candidacy for presidential elections and same-sex marriage. Preparation of these referendums is relatively advanced. As regards the fourth report, Government has agreed that work should commence on the establishment of an electoral commission. Work is ongoing on the remaining reports, which, as the House will be aware, deal with matters such as giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections, Dáil reform, economic, social and cultural rights, and the Convention's conclusions and final recommendations. The Government expects to respond to all of these reports before the end of the current Dáil session. There is merit, therefore, in ensuring that the timing of referendums can be decided in the context of the overall programme of proposed reform, not least in order that the costs relating to the holding of referendums can be combined, where feasible, in the public interest. I again express the Government's appreciation of the innovative, thoughtful and participatory way in which the convention and its members have debated the relevant issues. I commend the convention on its work and thank it, on behalf of the Government, for its sixth report, the recommendations of which we intend to take forward as I have just outlined.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious that there are some secondary school students in the Visitors Gallery who may be interested in this debate because the Constitutional Convention was established because we wanted to have a Constitution that was not reflective of the Ireland of 1937 and was more reflective of the Ireland in which young people lived. This is interesting because, when the convention was established, it was suggested it was a waste of time and money and a vanity project. We were experiencing an economic disaster and economic issues were regarded as much more pressing and it was said we should not spend our time discussing issues related to the Constitution. However, in fairness to anyone who held that view but delved further into the issues presented in the weekend debates, generally in the Grand Hotel in Malahide, adopted a different view of how the Constitutional Convention worked. I echo the sentiments of Deputy James Bannon on the chairmanship of the debates by Mr. Tom Arnold. As a result of the work of the convention, there are to be three referendums next year, one of which will definitely be of interest to the students listening to the debate in the Visitors Gallery because it will be on the lowering of the voting age to 16 years. There is to be a referendum on same-sex marriage and one on the Presidency. A number of criticisms were made in the House and I appreciate the comments made. One was that debates such as this should not be happening at all because there were more pressing matters than a discussion on blasphemy. Another was that we should not be tagging on this debate at the end of the week in the Dáil. A reasonable position probably lies somewhere in between. As echoed across the House, there is a danger of referendum fatigue. We have had quite a few referendums and there are to be some more next year. It was announced today that the intention was to hold a referendum on blasphemy. The issue is not so much that we have two competing rights but two very deeply cherished rights, one being the sacred right to freedom of speech, while the other concerns the freedom to practise one's religion. The suggestion of the Constitutional Convention and my belief is that the provision on the offence of blasphemy does not belong in the Constitution. It is the kind of matter Members should be charged to address legislatively. There is no intention to replace the provision within the Constitution in legislative frameworks, but, at the same time, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 could readily deal with the issues being discussed. We will have plenty of time to toss over and back the arguments on this issue. The Constitution should be a living document, not one necessarily set in stone. People should be sufficiently comfortable with it and sufficiently open-minded and generous of spirit to revisit it as time passes and different circumstances arise. I appreciate the comments made. There has been much discussion on the 2009 Act which, in fairness to the previous Government, emerged as a result of the Corway case and a recommendation from the Attorney General that the judgment be legislated for. That was the context to the 2009 Act on blasphemy. If we were to remove the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution, we would have a better chance of revisiting the Act. I thank all contributors whose contributions are very much appreciated. We will have a chance in public discourse to discuss this issue much more thoroughly before it is put to the people in order that they can make their final decision on it.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on behalf of the Government on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Niall Collins. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is, unfortunately, not in a position to attend today owing to other unavoidable commitments. The substance of the Bill should be taken in the positive spirit in which it is presented. The Deputy has outlined the objectives of the Bill and I do not propose to repeat what he has said. As Members will be aware, the Bill was published last February and a lot has happened since, with reference to strengthening the operation of the criminal justice system. This is especially the case with regard to the delivery of a quality and effective policing service in which all of the people can have full confidence. In April this year the Government announced a new programme of justice reform in response to the series of issues that had come to light in relation to An Garda Síochána. These issues are familiar to Deputies and are, as they know, wide-ranging and serious. The term "systemic failure" has been applied to the situation that has emerged. In that light it must be fully and honestly acknowledged that the policing system, with the standing of the Garda organisation, has gone through a difficult and challenging period. Given the overall circumstances that have developed, it is not going too far to say we are at a pivotal juncture in Irish policing. We have to look back and thoroughly examine what went wrong. At the same time, we have to look forward and decide, here and now, what kind of police service we want for the country. The Government's programme of justice reform provides a comprehensive and concrete platform for these two sets of actions. It is evident from the events to which I have referred that an essential element of the reform needed is an enhanced system of police accountability. This is, of course, a matter that is referred to in the Bill we are discussing. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's programme of justice reform includes the establishment of a new independent policing authority, which is a very positive step. The Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform, chaired by the Taoiseach, is charged with overseeing the development of legislative proposals for the new authority. This is a project to which a very high priority has been attached and it will continue to be addressed on that basis.  The accountability of the Garda Commissioner is one of the most important matters being addressed in the drafting of the general scheme for the policing authority Bill. In that context, the Government has made it clear that, in policing matters, the Garda Commissioner will be accountable in the exercise of his or her functions to the new authority. The preparation of the general scheme is at an advanced stage and the Minister has confirmed that she will bring it before the Government as quickly as possible.  The Government appreciates the work undertaken by Deputy Niall Collins on this Bill. At the same time, I am sure he will acknowledge that, apart from the urgent work under way on the policing authority, the Government has been proactive in bringing forward measures which cover the same ground as that covered in the Bill. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 was recently initiated and is expected to be debated in the House in the coming weeks. The Bill is another important element of the Government's reform programme. Its main purpose is to amend the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. To a certain but more limited extent, this is one of the objectives covered by Deputy Niall Collins's Bill. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill is concerned with a number of areas and a significant measure in its own right. In particular, it provides for the first time that the Garda Commissioner will come within the investigative remit of GSOC; will confer additional police powers on GSOC for criminal investigation purposes; provide greater autonomy for GSOC in examining Garda practices, policies and procedures; and enable the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to carry out inspections on its own initiative without the need for the prior approval of the Minister for Justice and Equality. On a point of information, the Minister has indicated that she will further consider legislative changes with regard to GSOC within the framework of the policing authority Bill.  In addition, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which came into operation on 15 July deals with Garda whistleblowers by way of provisions similar to those proposed in the Deputy's Bill. The new Act inserted a section into the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to allow members of An Garda Síochána to make protected disclosures to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct. The Government has committed in the programme for Government to the introduction of legislation to protect whistleblowers. I note that Deputy Niall Collins's Bill contains provisions to allow GSOC to access the Garda PULSE computer system. No specific statutory amendment is needed for this purpose and I understand it is being catered for operationally on the basis of technical co-operation between GSOC and An Garda Síochána.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality commenced a review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 earlier this year and has held hearings with interested parties, including GSOC and An Garda Síochána, following a public consultation process.The Minister received interim recommendations from the committee in June. A number of the committee's recommendations are catered for in the Government's No. 3 Bill and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. The joint Oireachtas committee is continuing its review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Minister understands that it will bring forward a more detailed and comprehensive report. She is looking forward to receiving this and she will consider all the recommendations made by the joint committee. The Government's reform programme is not confined to legislative measures. In other areas, substantial progress has been made and the current momentum is being sustained. Last month, the open competition for the recruitment of the next Garda Commissioner was announced. An appointment from this competition is expected in late November-early December. An independent review mechanism has been established to review complaints alleging Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of such allegations. A panel consisting of senior and junior counsel was established and the aim is to have the majority of cases reviewed within a period of up to 12 weeks.  The Fennelly commission of investigation into the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda stations and related matters has been up and running since June and is due to report to the Government by the end of this year. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate's crime inspection report is imminent. This report will cover a wide spectrum of policing activity including the recording, investigation and prosecution of crimes. The report will also deal with a number of concerns raised in the report submitted to the Government by Mr. Sean Guerin SC following his review of certain Garda actions. The Government has committed to establishing a commission of investigation into matters arising from the Guerin report. The terms of reference of the commission, including the timeframe and the appointment of a member, are under consideration and will be finalised shortly.  The Government published Judge Cooke's inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC in June. Recently, GSOC published a redacted version of the report commissioned from Mr. Mark Connaughton SC into the possible disclosure of confidential information. I welcome the publication of GSOC's report in the interest of public transparency. I might add, importantly, that the Government's No. 3 Bill meets a number of key commitments made arising from the publication of the Cooke report. These relate specifically to ensuring that GSOC can conduct a public interest investigation without reference to a specific complaint and also enhancing the effectiveness of the existing statutory provisions concerning the exchange of information between the Garda Síochána and GSOC. The Minister published the report of the Independent Review Group on the Department of Justice and Equality in July. Since its publication, an open competition to recruit a new Secretary General to my Department has been announced and the Minister is working closely with management to implement the report's recommendations. The Garda Síochána has been included within the scope of the Freedom of Information Bill 2013 in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government to extend freedom of information to all public bodies. The Heads of the Bill were previously extensively debated in committee in the Oireachtas. The Bill has concluded all Stages in the Dáil and has been tabled for the Seanad. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted quickly. A review under the Haddington Road agreement will make recommendations on the use by the Garda Síochána of the resources available to it with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in its operations and administration. The review encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána. The review is expected to be completed by mid-November and will form a platform for the new Garda Commissioner to oversee a programme of comprehensive reform in the organisation.  The concept of organisational culture has been referred to in many quarters over the past several months in respect of the Garda Síochána. September saw the Garda College in Templemore welcome new recruits for the first time in a number of years. We want these men and women and the further recruits that will follow them to be members of a police force that upholds the finest and most professional standards in policing - members of a force that I and citizens of this State are justly proud of. The Government has committed itself to having in place and, as required, to changing Garda structures and systems that will provide our communities with the policing service they deserve. It is not a process that is being undertaken just for its own sake but is directed towards ensuring that the Garda Síochána will be fully up to the task of meeting the challenges of modern policing throughout the country. With that in mind, it is very important that the measures to be put in place in the area of policing reform are properly co-ordinated. This is what the comprehensive Government justice reform programme is about. As I have indicated, the programme has already produced important results and I am fully confident that it will bring about the necessary changes so that confidence in policing can be fully restored. Bearing in mind the overall objectives of the Deputy's Private Members' Bill, the Government does not intend to oppose it on Second Stage in this House. However, the Deputy will appreciate that since he originally introduced his Bill, the Government has embarked on a very substantial programme of criminal justice reform. In that regard, I wish to make it clear to the House that the Government intends to proceed fully with the programme. It will, of course, be dealt with as a major priority.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to respond to the debate on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Niall Collins. I thank him and all other contributors to the debate. Debates such as this are invaluable as they enable us, as Deputies, to reflect on the critical issues of Garda oversight and accountability. Reflection is the foundation of effective policy-making. We are at a pivotal juncture in Irish policing. Collectively, we are charged with moulding the type of service we all want. I hope the Government's decision not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage will be viewed as a genuine indication that it wants to seize this historic opportunity to work collectively for reform. While it accepts the principles of oversight and accountability and decided not to oppose the Bill, it has been actively pursuing its programme of justice reform. One facet of that reform programme is new Government legislation to expand the remit and powers of GSOC and establish a new policing authority. In this context, some of the measures provided for in the Deputy's Bill have already been achieved, while others are in the process of being dealt with.I have spoken about the Government's legislative reforms in the course of the debate. The Government is absolutely committed to progressing the new legislation as a matter of urgency and this is being overseen by the new Cabinet committee on justice reform established this year and chaired by the Taoiseach. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 will be debated on Second Stage soon. Legislation to establish a new independent policing authority is at an advanced stage. The Government appreciates the importance of establishing the policing authority and is pursuing the matter with urgency. The Government's reform programme is ambitious in its scope. I outlined many aspects of the programme in my opening contribution, including the commissions of investigation, the independent review mechanism, the Cooke inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC and the establishment of the policing authority. However, as a Government, we must be ambitious. It has been a very difficult year for policing in the State and our chief aim is to restore not just the public's confidence in the Garda Síochána but also the Garda Síochána's confidence in itself. So much good work is done on a daily basis by gardaí throughout the country. There is much to be proud of. I suggest that those who would welcome this reform most are the decent, hard-working and patriotic gardaí who regularly put their bodies on the line for the security of the State. I refer to instances outlined by Deputies which have shaken the confidence of the public, such as the Corrib gas situation, for example. I know from my experience of instances of the difficulties encountered by young working-class men and the stories they tell me of their treatment in Garda stations. This is an issue. The relationship between working-class communities and An Garda Síochána has been a difficult one but there are many thousands of instances from all around the State of good members of the force doing excellent work beyond the call of duty in the service of those communities and of their State, an example being the CLAY project in Crumlin which I visited recently. While I am aware of some of the disturbing and difficult cases which feed into a culture which needs to be addressed, now is the opportunity for us to address it. I also have responsibility for new communities and there are questions about how these communities feel confident in reporting issues to An Garda Síochána and how the force reflects the society it is charged to serve. No more than other areas of public service such as this House, I ask if the force represents the community it polices. This is a question we need to address. It is critical that the current momentum of the Government's programme for justice reform continues over the coming months so the serious failings that have come to light can be dealt with effectively. We need to acknowledge that there have been serious failings. The reform programme will remain a central concern for the Government and we are determined to establish a system of police accountability that will be rigorous and robust.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am taking this topical issue debate on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, who is in Armagh attending a North-South Ministerial Council meeting with his counterpart from Northern Ireland. Cuan Álainn, situated in Tallaght, is a refuge for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence. Since the centre opened in 2012, a total of 55 women and 82 children have accessed its services. Respond! has provided €350,000 in funding to the centre. The Child and Family Agency does not fund Respond!'s Cuan Álainn refuge through its domestic sexual and gender-based violence services programme. The agency has advised that a meeting is planned with Respond! next week to discuss the services provided. It might be helpful for members of the House if I share some background to the arrangements for dealing with this issue at a strategic level. Due to the complex nature of the issues involved in domestic and sexual violence, and the need for a co-ordinated and effective response to these issues, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, Cosc, was established as an executive office in the Department of Justice and Equality in 2007 and that Department currently has overall policy responsibility in this area. Cosc formulated a comprehensive cross-Government strategy, which combines the efforts of a very broad range of organisations and individuals, to combat all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. This strategy runs to 2014. Cosc is in the process of preparing a new cross-sectoral strategy from 2015 onwards. With regard to service delivery, the new Child and Family Agency has since its establishment on 1 January this year, taken on responsibility for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services previously funded by the Health Service Executive, HSE. Specialist domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services are primarily provided through a large number of non-governmental organisations. In 2014, some €19 million in funding is being provided by the Child and Family Agency by way of grant aid to 62 specialist domestic violence and sexual violence services. These include 16 rape crisis centres and sexual violence services; 44 domestic violence services, including 20 refuges; two national networks, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, and Safe Ireland. For the first time, this area is under national direction. We now have a single line of accountability and a consolidated national budget which is reserved for allocation to these particular services. Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services can now be delivered within a broad child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model. In recognition of the policy priority which the agency is attaching to this issue, a dedicated position of programme manager for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was created within the agency and the post holder took up the position earlier this year. This will help to bring greater cohesion to service delivery. A review of domestic sexual and gender-based violence services has been under way in recent months to get an in-depth understanding of current service provision and identify priorities for developments in these services. The findings of this review will be used in planning for future developments in service provision. A roadmap setting out strategic priorities for domestic sexual and gender-based violence service provision over the next three years is due to be completed shortly. While the emphasis is on front-line services, issues such as training support, quality assurance and preventative measures are also being considered. Through this process the Child and Family Agency is engaged in ongoing consultation with domestic violence and sexual violence services about planned developments. I am pleased to say that the consultative process has been very positive. The discussions will have regard to key aspects of planned developments and a commissioning approach for 2015 service provision will be established. The new Child and Family Agency is committed to working in partnership with domestic violence services and other services providing support to women and children experiencing domestic abuse and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is awaiting the outcome of the agency's discussions with Respond!
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and will raise his concerns again with the Minister upon his return. The Child and Family Agency is a major reform and has been welcomed across this House. The issue in the Deputy's constituency will be the subject of a meeting next week and we will follow up with discussions after that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to discuss this crucial issue with the Deputy. In effect, the life expectancy of certain people in certain parts of Ireland is lessened. We need to take this serious issue on board. I will present the reply from the Department of Health to the House on behalf of the Minister and we can expand on it. As we have been making progress with cancer control over recent years, we have focused on improving the quality and equity of cancer services through reorganisation and expansion. We have moved from a fragmented system of care to one that consolidates cancer treatment in larger centres, with multidisciplinary care and decision-making. The national cancer control programme has reorganised cancer surgery into eight designated cancer centres and ensured these centres have sufficient activity to provide and maintain ongoing surgical expertise. The programme has also established symptomatic breast disease clinics and rapid access clinics for lung and prostate cancer at the designated centres. These clinics are available to all patients, regardless of income. The HSE also provides free screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer. The Government recently announced the extension of the BreastCheck screening programme, which offers women between the ages of 50 and 64 a free mammogram every two years, to women between the ages of 65 and 69. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors. Tobacco use is considered to be the single most important risk factor for cancer. The Department of Health and the HSE are promoting healthier lifestyles to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including cancer. Policies include the achievement of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025. The National Cancer Registry, which publishes data on cancer incidence, treatment and survival in Ireland, has presented figures to demonstrate that regional variations in survival patterns are not statistically different. Long-term survival from cancer has greatly increased in the past decade. Survival at five years from diagnosis among men increased from 42% in the 1994-99 period to 60% in the 2005-09 period. The increase among women over the same period was from 52% to 62%. It is estimated that the five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2009 was 84.9%, which represented an increase on the rate of 75.1% for people diagnosed between 1994 and 1999. It is expected that survival rates will increase further due to the combined approach of prevention screening, early detection and improved treatment. The issue of health inequalities, as well as prevention, will be examined as part of the development next year of the next cancer strategy, which will run from 2016. Of course much of this is about the treatment of illnesses in certain areas. I feel quite strongly about the issue of life expectancy. The Government has adopted an area-based approach to tackling child poverty and disadvantage, using models like Young Ballymun, the Tallaght child development initiative and the Preparing for Life programme in Darndale. These models focus on parental empowerment, for example. Issues of maternal depression are becoming quite acute in certain disadvantaged areas. If mothers become isolated from the rest of the community, it can lead to destructive patterns of behaviour. When one focuses on the geographical dimension to the blackspots of disadvantage in this State, it is clear that the potential exists for different agencies to work together collectively. Often in disadvantaged areas, many people who are doing fantastic work are not in communication with each other. Models like Young Ballymun, the Tallaght child development initiative and the Preparing for Life programme in Darndale have broken down many of those entrenched positions. We are rolling out more of those area-based approaches. They might form part of the solution to tackling the issue that has quite rightly been raised by Deputy Kelleher today.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the raising of this equality issue by the Deputy. I agree with what he has said about the schools system. Children do not live in schools. They are influenced by many things outside the school system. They start school at the age of four or five when so many things have already happened to them and influenced their lives. They key to this is empowering the parents in terms of diet and lifestyle in the home. If one comes from an area that is steeped in disillusionment, one can be sucked into a pattern of addiction in which one is attracted by vices like alcohol and substance abuse. Obviously, that has knock-on effects on the wider community. It is about empowerment and prevention. As the Deputy quite rightly said, it is also about providing services and resources to those who are suffering from cancer-related illnesses. A wider societal approach is necessary here. As I have said previously, if we take an area-based approach, if we ask agencies to interlock with each other and - fundamentally - if we empower people, particularly young mothers, to think differently about diet, oral language and literacy skills and lifestyle and to take a fresh approach to parenting, it can be a starting point that leads to a long-term change in the life expectancy of people in certain disadvantaged areas. A report like this is a wake-up call for everybody. It is refreshing to have a discussion like this in the House because it is the real stuff of equality. It is an area in which policies and politicians can make a real difference. I appreciate the raising of this topic by the Deputy. I will personally raise it with the Minister when he returns. I think that, collectively, we can make some real differences in this area. It is not just a health issue. Many different strands are involved in it. Unfortunately, in government and in policy formation we sometimes tend to compartmentalise these areas far too much.However, we are in broad agreement as to the strategy we should take. We should have a continuing discussion on this matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Timmins for raising this important matter. The national clinical programme for acute coronary syndrome aims to increase the percentage of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI, patients who get PPCIs by ensuring that patients are being taken to the right place, their treatment is standardised and processes are in place to ensure prompt investigation of all acute coronary syndrome patients. Under this programme, St. Vincent's University Hospital, St. James's Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital operate as designated PPCI centres for the greater Dublin area on a 24-hour, seven-day per week basis. The HSE has advised the Department that, unfortunately, a premature decision was taken last week to withdraw St. Vincent's University Hospital as a 24-7 PPCI centre without the normal notifications to relevant stakeholders. This resulted in a temporary suspension over last weekend of ambulance transfers to St. Vincent's for patients suspected of having STEMI. From 4 p.m. last Friday until 8 a.m. on yesterday, ambulances were instructed to take confirmed STEMI patients in the greater Dublin area to either of the other two 24-7 PPCI centres - St. James's Hospital and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital. The HSE has confirmed that three patients suspected of having STEMI who would have been brought by ambulance to St. Vincent's over the weekend and Monday were transported by ambulance to St. James's Hospital for appropriate treatment. All patients who presented directly to St. Vincent's with suspected STEMI were able to avail of PPCI in St. Vincent's 24-7, if deemed clinically necessary. I am happy to report that St. Vincent's resumed its 24-7 PPCI service at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 November. A redesign of the PPCI programme, particularly the out-of-hours service, is under way within the HSE. The HSE acute hospitals division, in collaboration with the acute coronary syndrome programme and the National Ambulance Service, will enter into discussions with all Dublin hospitals currently delivering PPCI with a view to devising the most effective and sustainable model of care for PPCI in the region.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy raises a valid point. I will be sure to relay to the Minister his concerns as well as Deputy Kelleher's two points about health issues in his constituency and those disadvantaged areas nationally with a higher proportion of people who suffer cancer. Deputy Timmins has raised issues and deserves a comprehensive response from the Minister concerned. I will endeavour to ensure that he receives it.

Níl sé ceart ná cóir an milleán a chur ar éinne eile, ar nós na meáin chumarsáide nó na páirtithe polaitíochta eile.

I have a deep respect for many members of the Sinn Féin Party. Many of the stances they have taken have been quite brave. The spokesperson on justice and equality has campaigned for the rights of Travellers, as has Deputy Dessie Ellis, and this has been quite admirable and inspirational. However, it is easy to stand for the rights of people when there are no consequences. It is much more difficult to stand for the rights of people when there are consequences. It is easy to blame everybody else. I found it quite troubling that a man for whom I have deep personal and political respect, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, in his contribution could not even mention Maíria Cahill's name. He could not bring himself to mention her name. Rape has been a deeply troubling issue in Ireland for a very long time. It is not just about the republican movement, the Catholic Church or any church, sporting organisations here or the entertainment industry in Britain. It is everywhere and one is far more likely to be abused by a member of one's own family than anybody else. We cannot have a culture of "yes, but", which is the problem with the issue in Ireland. We have had a culture of "yes, but": "Yes, you say you were abused and yes, you say you were raped, but". This is what caused the problem in the church, swimming organisations, other sporting organisations, entertainment organisations and families which have had to deal with this problem. What we are getting on the airwaves from people I genuinely respect is, again, this attitude of "yes, but".I am not a victim of rape or child abuse, but if I was, the debate in recent weeks and months on this issue would suggest that Ireland is again saying to me, "yes, but". It is saying: "Keep quiet and shut up because there are more important things at stake here." I fully agree with what Deputy Conway said earlier. What is more important than the dignity of a victim of child rape? Getting a history lesson of the reality in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland insults the intelligence of every Member of this House and insults the intelligence of every Irish person, North and South, because it again goes to the culture of "yes, but". It is not correct that it is a media conspiracy or that the party political system is terrified of Sinn Féin and therefore that is the only reason these issues are being raised. This country has a deeply troubling history on this issue and we want to rebuild a country where we can talk openly about our problem in this area in order that young girls and boys will not have the culture of "yes, but". I wish to make three final points. I think the first has already been alluded to. Will those who have information come forward with that information and not keep asking others to do it because that has fallen on deaf ears in the past? Will Sinn Féin call off its hounds on social media because what they are doing is despicable? Can Sinn Féin assure everybody in the House that if in the future somebody is raped or sexually assaulted by a Sinn Féin member or supporter, it will defend the victim's rights to the end or will it again say "yes, but"?

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«This motion of confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government has been tabled in response to Sinn Féin's motion of no confidence. I take the opportunity to nail this idea that Sinn Féin is a left-wing party. Sinn Féin is an extremist Nationalist party. What extremist Nationalist parties across Europe do is attach their logo to everything that is popular and reject everything that is unpopular in order to get nationalist sentiment going. When they think the bank guarantee is popular, they support that and then they pretend that they did not. They say defaulting is a good idea even though we know the devastating effect that would have had on social protection, on public service jobs and on the country in general. That is not a left-wing position. Sinn Féin states it is in favour of a wealth tax. The property tax is a wealth tax but, of course, Sinn Féin cannot see that. Only two months ago, when Labour councillors and Green Party councillors on Dublin City Council suggested that rather than having a 15% reduction in the property tax in Dublin city they would have a 7.5% reduction and have €4 million put into homeless services, Sinn Féin councillors voted against it. When faced with either a populist decision on a real wealth tax and a populist decision of defending the homeless, they opted for the populist decision on a wealth tax. They cannot get their head around the fact that the property tax is a wealth tax and they voted to reduce it by 15%, meaning that the average €1 million home owner in Dublin city got €375 back while the homeless of Dublin did not get the €4 million that we hoped they would get.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is Sinn Féin populist politics.If Sinn Féin members believe in justice, they should talk to the family of Robert McCartney and the family of Paul Quinn. They say they are in favour of gender equality. They should talk to Maíria Cahill and her family and listen to what she thinks about their protestations on gender equality. Sinn Féin never talks about education. The left-wing credentials of my party is that we teach children to read. We put literacy at the heart of everything we do. What Sinn Féin does in the Republic and in Northern Ireland is teach children to be angry and to hate. As soon as anyone suggests that the influence of the Catholic Church in education should be reduced in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin goes right back to its sectarian mindset and ensures it will never stand over integrated education there. Sinn Féin is not a left-wing party. It is an extremist Nationalist party. It has no interest in jobs, growth or the real interests of people in this country and it cannot abide the fact that the Labour Party in government with Fine Gael led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, is recovering people’s pay and self-worth and is putting them back into employment in a country of which people can be proud compared with the country we inherited four years ago.

For more than two decades, successive Irish Governments have provided financial support to build the institutions of a Palestinian state, to promote peace building and to meet the immediate needs of the Palestinian people. The motion before the House calls on the Government to do all it can to assist in the development of the democratic and state institutions of the Palestinian state. I believe we are already doing this. Ireland, like other EU members states, is committed to supporting the Palestinian Authority as part of our overall programme of support for the Palestinian people. This support, which enables Palestinians to build institutions and provide essential public services, is critical to laying the foundations for a future State. We now provide more than €10 million annually in support to Palestinians to help them deliver on their development priorities, to support the promotion of human rights and to meet immediate humanitarian needs. Ireland is one of five partners working directly with the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education to support it in delivering its education development strategic plan. This year we have provided €1.5 million in funding, bringing our total support to €7.5 million, but Ireland also provides technical support to the education sector. There is clear evidence that our contribution is helping the Ministry to provide better quality education services to more Palestinian children. I am aware from our contacts with officials across a number of Palestinian Ministries that our work with others in improving education is seen as making a real difference to Palestinian institutions and is held up as an example. Other EU partners have engaged in parallel work with other Ministries, such as finance, and the EU has for a number of years operated a significant police training mission, known as EUPOL COPPS, assisting the Palestinian police in developing and improving professional and human rights standards. Seconded Irish staff have played a valuable role in that continuing mission. In our work to build up the capacities of the Palestinian institutions and prepare them to assume the responsibilities of a sovereign state, we know that merely reaching that goal of statehood is not enough. After decades of occupation, we want Palestinians to achieve a state that can be a model for a troubled region and can deliver real improvements in the lives of its citizens.A Palestine based on the rule of law and respect for human rights is the best guarantor of the longevity of any peace agreement, and the future security and prosperity of Palestinians and Israelis alike. While we work to strengthen the institutions on which a Palestinian state will be built, we must ensure that the Palestinian Authority can meet the immediate needs of the people living in the West Bank and Gaza. Their capacity to deliver essential public services such as health and education is not only essential for the immediate welfare of the Palestinian people but also critical to the creation of a Palestinian state. In the current difficult context, delivery of public services is simply impossible without significant external support. Since 2008, working through a European Commission mechanism known as Mécanisme Palestino-Européen de Gestion de l'Aide Socio-Economique, PEGASE, we have provided €12 million to the Palestinian Authority to deliver public services. Our support has been focused on services in the areas of health, education and social protection. I know, however, that strong institutions alone will not guarantee the viability of a Palestinian state. We are funding a number of Palestinian and Israeli organisations that are working to address human rights issues. They focus on addressing freedom of movement, absence of rule of law, rights of prisoners and detainees, women's rights, and democratic development. These organisations play an important role not only in reporting human rights abuses but in holding their own authorities to account, a key element of all democracies. Regrettably, while we work to ensure that Palestinian institutions are ready for statehood, we continue to have to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people. The humanitarian situation continues to be precarious, as the key drivers of vulnerability remain in place. The protracted crisis is compounded by recurrent escalations in hostilities, such as the appalling tragedy in Gaza this year, which increase humanitarian needs. The conflict in Gaza this year had devastating humanitarian consequences. At present, approximately 100,000 people remain displaced and are in need of food, water, health services and shelter solutions. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, some 20,000 people are still living in schools in Gaza. It is estimated that 18,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, leaving approximately 108,000 people homeless. Damage to public infrastructure was extensive, and despite repairs to the water and sanitation network in Gaza, significant constraints still impair the delivery of these services. Electricity outages for 12 hours a day continue in most areas across Gaza. Critical infrastructure was severely damaged or destroyed: 50% of all medical facilities sustained severe damage, 22 schools were completely destroyed and 118 damaged, and more than 70 hospitals and clinics were damaged. This latest conflict has compounded an already serious humanitarian situation with widespread poverty, an extremely fragile economy and aid dependency. Approximately two thirds of the population of Gaza were receiving food assistance prior to the crisis and after seven weeks of conflict, most Palestinians in Gaza can no longer meet their most basic needs. Earning a livelihood is simply impossible. We provide €4 million annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA; this year we responded to the crisis in Gaza by providing an additional €1 million to UNRWA. This support is helping to provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families, many of whom had to flee their homes. Over the next two years we will provide a further €2 million to the Palestinian Authority and UN partners for long-term recovery assistance in Gaza. Ultimately, of course, we see the end of the occupation as the essential step in addressing the problems of Palestine, including Gaza. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for European affairs and data protection, Deputy Dara Murphy, has set out the ways in which the Government is working to achieve that end. Within that context, the Government will continue to reflect, both nationally and along with our EU colleagues, on the role that the specific step of recognition of Palestine could play. We have made clear that the Government has an open mind about any action, including early recognition of Palestine, which can positively contribute to the goal we all share of an end to the conflict and a secure future for Palestinians and Israelis. This Government will continue to do all we can to ensure that a future Palestinian state will be built on strong institutions capable of meeting the needs of the people of that state.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The Minister regrets that she is unable to be present as she is abroad on official business. The Minister has asked that I emphasise that the initial decision to introduce outsourced safety cameras came after a number of years of detailed analysis and was identified as a key additional measure to reduce deaths and serious collisions on our roads. I need not remind the Deputy that the Road Safety Authority, An Garda Síochána and many others working in the field of road safety, continue to emphasise the role played by speeding in serious collisions. Excessive and inappropriate speed is the number one road safety concern. The advice to the Minister is that in many instances, reducing speed by even a few kilometres per hour can made all the difference to the severity of a collision. It was against this background that GoSafe was awarded the contract to provide outsourced safety cameras in November 2009, following a tendering process. Operations commenced in November 2010 and were supported by advertising and an awareness-raising campaign highlighting the life-saving objective of the cameras. The Minister wishes to clarify that GoSafe is paid according to the number of hours of surveys and monitoring. The number of detections has no bearing on the payments made. The service provided by GoSafe operates under the overall direction and oversight of An Garda Síochána, including with respect to scheduling of speed monitoring, training and quality assurance. Vans operate in defined speed enforcement zones, the location of which is in the public domain, including on the Garda website. These zones were identified following an objective and evidence-based analysis of collision data and speed surveys. Compliance has increased across the zones since the network was introduced. For example, between January 2011 and October 2013, compliance in 50 km/h limit zones increased from 62% to 98%, while compliance in 80 km/h zones increased to 96%. The Garda authorities are reviewing the location of the zones on a continuous basis to ensure the cameras are located where they can have the most impact on safety. All of the analysis carried out points to the conclusion that the safety cameras have saved lives and therefore bring very significant human and economic benefits. Moreover, research carried out on behalf of the RSA earlier this year found that 81% of adults surveyed supported the use of safety cameras and 71% surveyed believe them to be effective in influencing motorists to drive more safely. It is also important to bear in mind that the safety cameras free up Garda resources for other road safety enforcement, including more mobile operations, as well as carrying out alcohol checkpoints. The Minister is aware of the recent court cases in which GoSafe speeding detections have been dismissed. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment on the outcome of specific cases before the courts. She has, however, discussed the matter with the Garda authorities and understands that they are carefully studying the recent rulings and taking legal advice, including with respect to the possibility of seeking clarification from the higher courts. This is being addressed by the Garda authorities as a matter of urgency and developments will be reported to the Minister. In so far as the question of reviewing the law is concerned, the legislation governing the operation by An Garda Síochána of speed detection cameras and the use of outsource safety cameras, is contained in section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The advice from An Garda Síochána, however, is that the recent court cases do not identify issues which would warrant amendment of the legislation. I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and I will certainly communicate the points he has made to the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputy for his contribution. I acknowledge his contribution was not about the effect of the speed cameras. The Deputy will appreciate that the reply as provided indicates the Minister takes the issue seriously and has liaised with the Garda authorities.I am not in a position to discuss the individual cases the Deputy has outlined. The Garda is studying the recent rulings and taking legal advice with respect to the possibility of seeking clarification from the higher courts. I take on board the points made by the Deputy and will communicate them to the Minister for Justice and Equality. It is convenient the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is here. I will endeavour to get a more detailed response for the Deputy. The Minister for Justice and Equality is unable to comment on individual cases. The issues raised by the Deputy have been discussed with the Garda authorities and they are aware of them. We will endeavour to work on a cross-departmental basis to provide the Deputy with a more direct response if he requires one.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who unfortunately cannot be present, I thank all of the Deputies who have contributed to this debate. The Minister is pleased that the Bill before us has attracted a significant degree of consensus, particularly regarding its key provisions which provide for the expansion of the remit and powers of both GSOC and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate. The Minister is grateful to Deputies for their support for these aspects of the Bill and hopes, given the level of consensus that has been demonstrated, that it will be possible to enact this Bill quickly. As the Minister outlined in her opening contribution, this Bill is one of a series of measures being taken by the Government as part of a comprehensive programme of justice reform which will substantially strengthen Garda accountability. This reform programme is being informed to a substantial extent by the excellent work undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. In line with the recommendation of that committee, for example, section 11 of the Bill will allow the Garda Inspectorate to conduct, on its own initiative, inspections or inquiries relating to particular aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda Síochána. At present the inspectorate can only do so with the prior consent of the Minister.  I wish to inform Deputies that this Bill is not, and was never intended to be, the only or primary legislative response of this Government to the relevant work of the aforementioned Oireachtas committee. Deputies will be aware that the Minister has published the scheme of a Bill for the proposed new policing authority which takes into account a significant number of the recommendations made by the joint committee. The Bill is being drafted on a priority basis and the scheme has been considered by the joint committee in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny. The Minister is looking forward to publishing the Bill and bringing it before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. In addition, the Government has approved the nomination of Ms Josephine Feehily as the chairperson designate for the policing authority and she participated in the selection process for the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, Ms Nóirín O'Sullivan by the Government, following an open and competitive competition organised by the Public Appointments Service. Ms Feehily will be involved in the arrangements for the establishment of the authority.  Overall, the recommendations made by the joint committee are being examined in the context of the Government's reform programme. Deputies will be familiar with the fact that on 19 December 2014, in accordance with the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the Minister laid before this House a draft of the order, which includes the terms of reference, proposing the establishment of a commission of investigation to address the recommendations of Mr. Seán Guerin, senior counsel, in his report on allegations made in respect of certain Garda matters. The Minister also made a statement outlining the reasons for the establishment of the commission. All of the matters recommended by Mr. Guerin for inclusion in a commission of investigation are included in the terms of reference. A resolution approving the draft order is required to be passed by each House of the Oireachtas. The relevant resolution has been tabled for discussion and approval by this House on 28 January. This will provide an opportunity for Deputies to debate the matter. Subject to approval by the Houses, the Government will then take the order establishing the commission.  In the course of the debate on this Bill, Deputies referred to the independent review by a panel of counsel about allegations of Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of cases. The Minister previously outlined that the role of the independent review is, effectively, to assess those cases with a view to determining to what extent, and in what manner, further action may be required. Where counsel recommend further investigations, the Minister will be very strongly guided by that advice. Clearly there are a number of possible options for further investigations, in particular by way of referral to GSOC.Any recommendation for a referral of a case to a commission of investigation will be very carefully considered, including whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission. Reference was made to a number of specific topics, including the significant contribution to policing made by the Garda Reserve. The Minister is very much aware of the excellent work undertaken by members of the reserve. In terms of overall Garda recruitment, reserve members are provided with an opportunity under the Garda admission and appointment regulations to demonstrate the experience they have acquired as reserves. This takes place during the interview process managed by the Public Appointments Service and enables reserve members to highlight their skills. In that regard, it is significant to note that of the 100 Garda recruits who entered the Garda College in September last year, 23 were members of the Garda Reserve. As Deputies will be aware, this was the first intake of Garda recruits since 2009 and it was followed by an intake of a further 100 new recruits in December last which also included former Garda Reserve members. An additional intake of 100 recruits is due to enter training at the end of this month, bringing to 300 the number of recruits in the Garda College since last September. This development is a measure of the Government's commitment to the Garda Síochána.  The first intake of recruits will attest as members of the Garda Síochána in May 2015 and will be assigned to Garda stations by the Garda Commissioner. It is a key objective of the Garda Commissioner to allocate all the resources at her disposal in a manner which maximises their impact on the protection of members of the public and prevention and detection of crime. In that context, Garda management keeps under continuing review developments in respect of security assessments, crime trends and policing priorities to ensure the best possible use is made of resources. The operation of Garda rosters was also raised. The new Garda roster was introduced on a pilot basis in April 2012 after negotiation and agreement by Garda management and staff associations. It was developed in compliance with the European working time directive to better match the supply of and demand for resources and took on board best practice from a welfare perspective. The pilot period was extended under the Haddington Road agreement to June 2014 and has been further extended by agreement. As is the case with this pilot, the practical application of the complex systems involved has identified where changes may be required. The purpose of the current review is to identify and implement any necessary changes and this process is being actively pursued.  A number of Deputies also referred to providing the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission with access to the Garda PULSE system. In that regard, GSOC has confirmed to the Department that it is satisfied with the level of access to PULSE being provided. In addition, section 9 contains a provision that will underpin any requirement on the Garda Commissioner to provide information to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The section, which inserts a new section 103A into the Garda Síochána Act 2005, places a statutory obligation on the Commissioner to provide GSOC, as soon as practicable, with information the commission requires for the purposes of carrying out its functions. Deputies may also be aware that an additional €1 million in funding has been made available to GSOC in 2015 to resource the organisation's activities this year. Arrangements have been put in place for a recruitment campaign for additional staff. The issues of efficiency and resources are being kept under continuing review by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. A short technical amendment is required to section 8 and the Minister intends to introduce such an amendment on Committee State. On behalf of the Minister, I express my gratitude to Deputies who have expressed support for the Bill. The Minister looks forward to its early enactment.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«As the House will be aware, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015 was published last Monday. I acknowledge the substantial work done by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and, in particular, its Chairman, Deputy Michael McCarthy, in laying the groundwork for what has become the published Bill. Publication of the joint committee's report was an important milestone in shaping the debate on the legislation. The report informed, in a genuine and meaningful fashion, the further development of the heads of the Bill. While the report did not make recommendations as such, it outlined a number of possible courses of action that might be considered in the further development of the heads of the Bill. As the joint committee made considerable efforts in preparing its report, it is only right that I spend some time addressing each of these possible courses of action. In the first instance, the committee proposed that Ireland's existing annual greenhouse gas emission limits, as agreed under the European Union's so-called effort sharing decision of 2009, constitute the required mitigation objectives of the Bill for the period 2013 to 2020. The Government agrees with this approach. However, as the targets set down under the effort sharing decision are already legally binding on Ireland, there was no need to explicitly include them in the legislation. It should be noted that the Bill, as published, explicitly refers to the European Union's effort sharing decision as one of the existing obligations on the State which must be respected. The second possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that Ireland's annual emission limits for the periods to 2030, 2040 and 2050 should ultimately be agreed by member states under the EU Roadmap 2050 or any future burden sharing arrangement agreed at EU level. I am pleased to note that the committee and the Government are at one on annual emission limits up to 2050 and that they should arise from EU negotiations, rather than be unilaterally self-imposed in the Bill without regard to the wider EU and international sphere. The third possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the intervals between proposed national low carbon roadmaps for emission reductions should be not greater than five years. An interval of seven years was proposed in the original outline heads of the Bill. Nonetheless, having regard to the committee's views, I am pleased to note that we took on board this advice and the published Bill specifies a five-year rather than a seven-year
cycle. The fourth possible course of action is that the preparation of sectoral roadmaps for emission reductions should be subsequent to the publication of the national roadmap for the relevant period and should, in aggregation, be consistent with the prior targets established by the national roadmap. With respect, this advice is to somewhat misunderstand the process of preparing national roadmaps or national mitigation plans as they are now called in the published Bill. In this regard, the preparation of sectoral mitigation measures will be closely co-ordinated across Departments so as to ensure that, when aggregated, the subsequent national mitigation plan will provide for meeting the relevant mitigation targets. This co-ordination will be facilitated by extensive modelling work undertaken across the main emitting sectors. The fifth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that national policy for future agricultural emissions to 2050 should be predicated on the basis of zero emissions growth relative to 2013. This does not appear to be a realistic option having regard to Food Harvest 2020, the medium-term strategy for the development of the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sectors for the period to 2020. Moreover, it may be in contradiction of the committee's proposal in respect of carbon neutrality in agriculture, an issue to which I will return. The sixth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should investigate non-national-based emission management strategies at European Union level such as an agricultural emissions trading scheme, in which efficient and sustainable Irish agricultural practices would be rewarded with increased emission quotas. This advice did not specifically relate to the further development of the legislation; therefore, I will not dwell too much on it. However, suffice it to say I appreciate the intent behind the proposal in that it recognises Ireland's unique emissions profile, in which agriculture features prominently, not because of any lack of agri-efficiency but solely relating to the size of the agriculture sector relative to other sectors. The seventh possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that, in preparing the sectoral roadmaps for agriculture, a target of carbon neutrality should be established for 2050, with measurable progress towards it scheduled for 2020, 2030 and 2040. The intent behind this proposal is correct; carbon neutrality is the appropriate avenue of policy development in respect of future greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, by making use of appropriate carbon sinks. I am certain that the sectoral mitigation measures proposed for the agriculture sector will fully reflect this goal.  The eighth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that, for the purposes of the Bill, low carbon development should be interpreted as near zero emissions for 2050 in the energy, buildings and transport sectors and carbon neutrality in the agriculture sector. Since publication of the committee's report, further consideration was given to a national vision for low carbon development. The outcome was communicated with the publication, last April, of the national climate policy position, which sets out a long-term vision of low carbon transition based on an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors and, in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. Given that Ireland will likely be subject to binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets up to 2050 as part of the EU process and that a long-term vision of low carbon transition has been set out in the national climate policy position, the Government does not consider it either appropriate or necessary to include a national 2050 target in legislation. The ninth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the Bill should provide for the establishment of a national green climate fund ring-fenced within, or separate to, the environment fund. It would be used to support climate mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries and constitute Ireland's contribution to the international green climate fund established under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC. While I applaud the intent, the reality of our fiscal situation militates against this course of action. In this regard, any future funding by Ireland of the international green climate fund should be part of the annual Estimates process, rather than a matter of statutory obligation. That is not to say nothing is being done in this regard. Despite difficult fiscal circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, including public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries. Although the vast majority of Ireland's annual climate finance flows through Irish Aid, Ireland's overseas development programme, which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it should be noted that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government also made a contribution of €33 million over two years during the fast-start finance period 2010-12 in supporting the Global Climate Change Alliance and the Least Developed Countries Fund. Moreover, as articulated by the Minister, Deputy Alex White, in his Lima COP plenary address, despite our recent difficult economic circumstances, Ireland has maintained flows of public climate finance at fast-start finance levels, delivering approximately €34 million in grants in 2013. We expect to match this in 2014 and are actively exploring all options for scaling up our mobilisation of climate finance, including in the green climate fund. The tenth possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the expert advisory body should consist of a chairperson and not more than five other members, all of whom should be independent of State or stakeholder interests, and that it should be supported by a technical secretariat, comprising the heads of the EPA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the ESRI. The Government does not share the committee's view in this regard. Pursuant to the published Bill, the expert advisory council will comprise a chairperson and between eight and ten ordinary members, four of whom shall be ex
officio members comprising the heads of the four agencies. In appointing a chairperson and the ordinary members it is important to note that the Government will consider the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for the effective performance of the council. The inclusion of the ex
officio members will help to underpin this much needed expertise and experience on these matters, as well as providing a link with relevant agencies working in the field so as to ensure effective implementation. Accordingly, the Government is not minded to alter this arrangement. The 11th possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the expert advisory body should exercise its functions independently and obtain the assistance of the technical secretariat in acquiring and processing data relevant to its activities. I do not believe the composition of the expert advisory council, as proposed in the published Bill, in any way prevents the advice emanating from this quarter from being anything other than independent and of the highest quality. Having the ex
officio members on the council directly, rather than relegated to some technical secretariat, means that the advice provided by the council will be well informed, robust, up-to-date and, just as important, capable of being implemented in the real world.This is crucial to ensure those charged with implementing mitigation policy measures enjoy buy-in from the start. The 12th possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the expert advisory body should be empowered to publish its annual reports subsequent to submitting them to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the committee. I am pleased to note that in the published Bill this advice has been taken on board and that the expert advisory council has been given the power to publish its annual and periodic review reports directly, after a short set period, following their submission to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The 13th possible course of action proposed by the joint committee is that the annual transition report to Dáil Éireann should be concluded by a statement from the Taoiseach as chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change detailing the progress made in emissions reductions in the preceding year and outlining the programme for achieving the required reductions in each sector for the forthcoming year. The Government does not consider it appropriate that this role should fall to the Taoiseach, as climate change policy properly falls within the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Accordingly, the Government believes it should fall to the Minister to make an overview statement as part of the annual transition report to Dáil Éireann, which constitutes an important exercise in transparency and openness.  As the House has heard, several of the joint committee's proposals were accepted in full and unequivocally. On others, however, agreement could not be reached. On others again, the intent, if not the letter, of the proposal found favour. That is probably the way things go.  I again thank the joint committee for its extensive work on the outline heads of the Bill and, in particular, its chairperson, Deputy Michael MacCarthy. It is obvious that the report was given genuine and detailed consideration and I am satisfied that it has promoted a better and more inclusive Bill than would otherwise have been the case.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is unavoidably committed to ministerial obligations in Riga, I thank the Deputies for their comments on the Bill. I remind the House of the commitment given by the Taoiseach to the Magdalen women in this House in February 2013.On that day the Taoiseach apologised on behalf of the State, the Government and our citizens to all those women for the hurt that was done to them and for any stigma they suffered as a result of the time they spent in Magdalen laundries. The Taoiseach informed this House that the Government had agreed to appoint Mr. Justice Quirke to make recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the help that the Government can provide in the areas of payments and other supports, including medical cards, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs. The purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke in regard to the medical card and health service provisions for these women. If Deputies compare the wording of the Bill and the wording of Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations, they will find that this Bill provides fully and comprehensively for the health services recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. These include general practitioner, medical and surgical services; drugs, medicines and surgical appliances; nursing services; home help services; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; counselling services; chiropody services; and physiotherapy services. As was stated yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, some NGOs have issued quite incorrect statements that the Bill does not provide for these services. As she stated, the only service not included in the Bill relates to alternative therapies with no proven medical benefits. The Bill also provides these women with exemption from charges for acute inpatient services, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. Furthermore, the Bill provides that payments made to these women arising from the scheme of ex gratia payments will not be included in any financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Again, this is fully in accordance with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke. A number of issues were raised. The first refers to top-up pension-type payments. Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation on that is being fully implemented. He did not, as has been suggested, recommend that these payments be backdated to the women's 65th birthday. This recommendation proposes that eligible women should, in addition and without regard to lump sum payments, receive weekly payments of €100 if aged under 66 years and the equivalent of the State contributory pension, €230.30, that is, if aged over 66 years for the remainder of their lives. These payments are to be calculated net of other State benefits. The Department of Social Protection has set up a separate scheme to facilitate the recommendation with regard to the top-up pension-type payments. It is continuing to process payments on a phased basis. The Government decided that the commencement date for the scheme was 1 August 2013. Therefore, regardless of when an applicant makes an application, if eligible for the scheme, she will have appropriate payments backdated to 1 August 2013. A question was asked about women who do not have capacity to act on their own behalf. They are already covered by section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, which deals with the appointment of a care representative. Mr. Justice Quirke recommended provision for a mechanism whereby a person can be appointed to act in the best interests of a woman who lacks capacity and who receives an ex gratia payment under the scheme. This is being done through the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil. This Government is fully implementing the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke and there should be no question or doubt about that fact. I agree with some of the sentiments expressed across the House about the nature of Irish society in the past and, as I described, our love affair with institutionalising people in mental institutions, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries or industrial schools. The Department of Justice and Equality and the Reception and Integration Agency do not like the comparison with direct provision centres, but in many respects it is apt. We should not live in a country with high walls where people wonder what goes on behind them, and continue that type of institutionalisation in this country. While we will do what we will do, in terms of implementing the recommendations in the report of Mr. Justice Quirke, we have to learn lessons from what happened in the past. Direct provision has been mentioned as a comparison, but it is the value system that we have that underpins our democracy, Republic and legislation that has to teach all of us in the House and Irish society the lessons of the Magdalen laundries. I commend the Bill to the House.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The Government shares the concerns of the Deputies about the ongoing human tragedy on the Mediterranean. At EU level, since the more than 300 migrants drowned off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October 2013, this issue has appeared on the agenda at almost every Justice and Home Affairs Council and was a major priority of the Italian Presidency. We should never forget that this is essentially an issue of enormous human tragedy. Deputies will appreciate that notwithstanding the complexities of the issues, the human tragedy dimension must never be relegated to a less important issue. Huge numbers of people are willing or, in some cases, forced to take major life threatening risks to reach Europe. In many cases, this is driven by the desperate need to escape the situation in their own country, for example, Syria. Allied to this is the major financial incentive this traffic provides for ruthless criminal gangs to engage in smuggling and trafficking and for whom life is cheap and migrant safety an irrelevant consideration. The vessels used to transport migrants are, in many cases, unseaworthy or otherwise ill-equipped to undertake a voyage in adverse weather. These factors are further compounded by the unstable situation in Libya, the main country of transit and embarkation point for the vessels. The Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation which had rescued well in excess of 100,000 people was discontinued with effect from last November by the Italian authorities on the commencement of Operation Triton co-ordinated by Frontex, the European external borders agency, although the mandates and range are not the same. However, I understand that in recent days the vessels and aeroplanes involved in Operation Triton have helped to save more than 3,000 migrants who departed from Libya. The journey for other migrants has sadly ended in a different way. Even when people are rescued, issues arise as to how they are to be dealt with within member states' asylum systems and there are considerable pressures on member states in the Mediterranean region in whose territory the migrants land. The focus of EU policy in this area has been multidimensional, reflecting the fact that a migrant's ultimate journey by sea to the European Union can be influenced by many factors. Therefore, the response highlighted actions, in co-operation with third countries, including regional protection; resettlement and reinforced legal avenues to Europe; the fight against trafficking, smuggling and organised crime; reinforced border surveillance contributing to the saving of lives of migrants on the Mediterranean and assistance to member states on the front line. Greater funding from Frontex is also important.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputies. There are no easy answers. Nobody can guarantee that there will be no further deaths. As long as people set out on these hazardous voyages, that will be inevitable, in spite of the best efforts of everybody involved in maritime missions. It is a case of working together within the European Union on both cause and effect. The contribution Ireland can make, apart from its support for EU initiatives in the area generally, is primarily humanitarian, with particular reference to Syria. We are one of the highest contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Since 2011 Ireland has provided almost €29 million in humanitarian support delivered through UN partners, the Red Cross and Irish NGOs. Ireland's support has been focused on supporting people displaced within Syria and across the wider region. This includes the regional development and protection programme, under which Ireland is committed to providing €2.5 million through an initiative being co-led by the European Commission and Denmark to support refugees and host communities affected by the ongoing Syrian crisis. Ireland is also one of the countries that provide for the resettlement of refugees, with a commitment to resettle 220 in the next two years. I have met many of them, particularly in Balseskin. A further 114 will be taken in under the Syrian humanitarian assistance programme, SHAP.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this very important issue. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is unfortunately not available to take the Topical Issue but I am responding in his place. Prior to November 2010 member states were obliged under EU legislation to publish information - names, addresses and amounts received - on recipients of amounts paid out of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, EAGF, or European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, CAP funds. This information was made available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine website and, in line with EU requirements, included a search engine to permit users to search the database using different criteria.  On 9 November 2010, following its judgment in a case taken by German CAP beneficiaries, the European Court of Justice found that aspects of EU legislation requiring the publication of information on beneficiaries of CAP funds, who are natural persons, were invalid. On the day that the judgment was delivered the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took down the CAP beneficiaries' database from its website. Following that judgment and pending the adoption of new rules taking account of the objections expressed by the court, the EU Commission adopted amending legislation in order to lay down explicitly that the obligation to publish the information on the beneficiaries does not apply to natural persons. However, they instructed member states to continue to publish information on legal persons and the Department has done so on an annual basis. Following the extensive analysis and the consultation with the stakeholders, the EU Commission determined that it was critical that any new proposal must observe a balance between the pursued objective of the public control of the use of the money from the EAGF and the EAFRD on the one hand, and the beneficiaries' right to respect for their private life in general and to protection of their personal data on the other. In September 2012 the Commission made a proposal on the publication of data on amounts received by all beneficiaries - natural and legal persons - that was intended to take account of the European Court of Justice judgment. The Commission's basic rationale was that it considered it vital to inform citizens how Union funds are being spent and that the new rules are based on a justification centred on the need for public control over the use of funds. The proposals were the subject of intensive discussion at Council meetings and subsequently in the formal discussions with the EU Commission and the European Parliament which led to the adoption of the new CAP and the legislation which underpins it. In accordance with EU legislation the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is obliged to ensure annual ex-post publication of all of the beneficiaries of CAP funding including both legal and non-legal persons. In accordance with regulations the Department must publish the name of the beneficiary, unless the amount of payment under CAP funds is less than €1,250 in which case the individual will be identified by a code; the municipality where the beneficiary is resident; the amount of payment corresponding to each measure received by a beneficiary; and the nature and description of each measure. In accordance with the regulation the Department will publish such information by the 31 May 2015 deadline. Work is currently ongoing within the Department on this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy makes a fair comment about what are effectively security concerns. It is reasonable that he would make his concerns known in the House. I will convey them to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we will see if we can make some progress.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the Government's approach to the funding of domestic violence services around the country and in the Deputy's constituency of County Laois. For the first time, with the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence service provision is under one body with clear national direction. Services can now be delivered within a wide child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model. In 2014, €17 million in funding was provided by the Child and Family Agency by way of grant aid to 62 specialist domestic violence and sexual violence services. These include 16 rape crisis centres-sexual violence services; 44 domestic violence services, including 20 refuges; and two national networks. In addition, funding of €2.54 million has transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affair's Vote from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which, in turn, has been transferred to Tusla. This funding was previously distributed under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 and is for domestic violence refuge services. The purpose of this funding transfer is to ensure that the State's relationship with the domestic violence services is managed in a manner which is more coherent and adapted to the needs of service users, that is, victims of domestic violence. In 2014, Tusla funded specialist domestic violence services in County Laois provided by Laois Domestic Abuse Services in Portlaoise. The service received €64,900 in funding from Tusla last year. As the Deputy outlined, the service involves the provision of domestic violence supports, including information, advocacy and counselling services to women experiencing, or who have experienced, domestic violence. The work of Laois Domestic Abuse Services and other community-based domestic violence services is recognised and absolutely valued. Tusla has recently completed an initial review of domestic violence and sexual violence services in order to identify strategic priorities and set out a Tusla roadmap for sexual violence and domestic violence services. There is for the first time a consolidated national budget for these services and an opportunity for more co-ordinated and equitable provision of sexual and domestic violence services across the country. Tusla will communicate with funded services shortly to advise on the Tusla budget and funding for 2015. Individual domestic violence service provider organisations, including Laois Domestic Abuse Service, will be contacted about their specific funding and service arrangements. Future planning for domestic violence and sexual violence services will seek to address gaps, avoid duplication and support effective delivery of front-line services nationally. Developments for domestic violence services in County Laois will be considered as part of Tusla's future commissioning processes. The agency has advised that population size will be one of the factors that will inform this process. Services responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are being given a high priority by Government and Tusla will work closely with service providers, giving particular priority to supporting front-line services.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy made some very constructive comments and I appreciate his positivity towards what we are trying to do. His comments on the population question are appreciated. I take on board the Deputy's comments on the individual service and the need for clarity, certainty and to plan for the future. I do not think any service, in particular one that deals with such a sensitive issue as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, should be insecure as to its future. I will take on board the Deputy's questions and get working on them to ensure the service is more confident, as it is providing an excellent service. Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputies for their contributions in this debate. I am always happy to take legislation in the spirit in which it is drafted and on its merits. Every Member is doing their best to find solutions to the issues in question. The finance committee has done some sterling work in tackling the issue of mortgage arrears. Many Deputies opposite made constructive comments. However, before they lose the run of themselves, they remind me of arsonists giving out to the fire brigade on how best to put out the very fire they started. The Government is proposing that the House declines a second reading of this Bill introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath for several reasons. The approach proposed is overly simplistic and risks creating a range of serious negative effects. The Minister believes the introduction of such measures would most likely discourage lending for house purchase purposes and exert a negative impact on a recovering housing market. The Bill is not fully thought out on fundamental issues. It would create extensive legal uncertainty and lead to a high risk of legal challenge which does not serve anyone's interests. The Minister has already completed a review of the insolvency legislation and has clearly indicated to the House her intention to bring forward proposals in this regard. The Minister appreciates, as does the Government, the genuine concerns that Deputy Michael McGrath and others have in raising this important issue. She is fully aware of the stress experienced by families living with unsustainable mortgage arrears who want to pay their way and keep their homes. It is for this reason that she has underlined her intention to put forward proposals focusing on this situation. Some of the figures cited in the debate on the Bill give a distorted picture of repossessions because they risk causing further alarm, unnecessarily, to borrowers who want to engage. Preliminary figures available to the Department of Justice and Equality indicate the number of civil bills for repossession issued across the country in January 2015 was fewer than the monthly average for 2014. While this is not a cause for great celebration or to belittle the fact that proceedings are being issued, it belies some of the language used and some suggestions of an explosion or avalanche of repossessions. For example, while I have no doubt the figures for the number of repossession cases listed before the Donegal courts quoted yesterday are correct, the fact is those figures refer to the number of repossession civil bills issued, not to the number of repossession orders actually granted. That is a very important distinction. For the whole of 2014, the average numbers of civil bills issuing each month in Donegal were higher than those issuing in January 2015. Nevertheless, for the whole of the year, only nine possession orders were granted in Donegal. In stating this figure, I am not by any means downplaying the stress felt by people arising from court proceedings. However, it is important to emphasise that it absolutely is not the case that all or most civil bills for possession issued will lead to possession orders being granted by the courts or to a borrower who wishes to engage, losing their home. Lending institutions often issue civil bills for possession in an effort to seek engagement with borrowers who have not previously engaged with their lenders. Many of these actions result in further negotiations between borrower and bank and in an arrangement which allows a borrower to stay in his or her home. It remains the Government's priority to ensure repossessions of family homes are absolutely a last resort, where all other avenues to resolve the arrears situation have been properly considered by the lender and have been exhausted. It is for that reason the Minister's proposals intend to focus on this issue, as she indicated yesterday. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 was raised by several Members. The Act’s objective was to deal with the legal uncertainty which had arisen as a result of several High Court judgments concerning remedies proposed by lending institutions in cases of mortgage default. The Act merely restored the position which was thought to apply when the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 was enacted, namely that the relevant provisions of the law in force prior to the commencement of that Act on 1 December 2009 would continue to apply to mortgages created prior to that date.It does not give any new powers to lending institutions and includes a new provision which benefits borrowers in mortgage distress. Section 2 of the Act provides that in any future repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower's principal private residence, the court may adjourn proceedings so that a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may be fully explored as an alternative to repossession. Unfortunately I have to conclude at that point.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I welcome this opportunity to continue the discussion on penal reform. I commend Deputy Stanton and the joint committee on their report which was published in March 2013 and recommends a range of measures designed to further the development of an effective and progressive penal system. I acknowledge Deputy Stanton's point in regard to the delay in discussing this report and will bring that message back to the Minister. The report recommends that prison numbers be reduced; that prison sentences of less than six months be commuted; an increase in standard remission from one quarter to one third and the introduction of an incentivised remission scheme of up to one half; the introduction of legislation providing for structured release, temporary release, parole and community return; address of prison conditions and overcrowding; and increased use of open prisons. The Minister believes that the committee's report complements the more recent report of the Penal Policy Review Group, which she published last September. This group was asked to make recommendations on how a principled and sustainable penal system might be further enhanced, taking into account resource implications, constitutional imperatives and our international obligations. It was also asked to consider the recommendations contained in the committee's report. There are common themes in both reports, such as reducing prisoner numbers, improving prison conditions, increased use of open prisons and the placing of the Parole Board on a statutory footing. Both reports acknowledge the considerable progress made in recent years and that more remains to be done. Naturally, there are differences in detail between both reports, which can be explored as part of the ongoing process of implementation.  The committee called for prisoner numbers to be reduced. Prison numbers have since been reducing. In 2013, we saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007. In 2013, there were 15,735 committals to prison, a decrease of 7.6 % on the 2012 total of 17,026. On 3 March 2015, the prisoner population stood at 3,768, which was 95% of the Inspector of Prisons' recommended total of 3,982. By comparison, on 3 March 2014, the prisoner population stood at 4,045, which was 98% of the inspector's recommended total of 4,124. All of this points to a reducing trend in prisoner numbers, indicative of the progress being made by this Government to reduce the prisoner population and to pursue alternatives to custody. The Minister believes that a specific target for reducing prisoner numbers should not be set as ultimately there are many factors which must be taken into account, including the rate of crime, public safety and the independence of courts in making sentencing decisions. Sanctions must be appropriate to each offender and not be restricted by a policy which seeks purely to reduce the number of people in prison. The committee recommended that sentences of imprisonment of under six months for all non-violent offences be commuted and replaced with community service orders. In this regard, it cited the experience in Finland where a court may commute a sentence of less than eight months to community work. The Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 goes further than this in that it positively obliges a court to consider community service in any case where there might be a sentence of up to one year. The committee also recommended that standard remission be raised to one third for all sentences over one month and that enhanced remission of up to one half be made available for certain categories of prisoners who engaged with services within prison. This was considered by the review group which, on balance, came down in favour of retention of the current system of remission, which has a standard rate of one quarter. The committee recommended that there be a single piece of legislation to provide for various forms of structured release and the recommended changes to the rates of remission. The Minister will consider the potential for consolidation of legislation in such matters. Finally, the committee recommended that prison conditions be improved and that the amount of open prisons be increased. Members will agree that major improvements have been made in prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison has been eliminated and priority is being given to reducing overcrowding in Cork, Limerick and the Dóchas Centre. It is intended to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended capacity of 3,982, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system. Mountjoy Prison has been transformed, almost beyond recognition. A new Cork prison is under construction and is on target to be completed later this year. The business case for the redevelopment of Limerick Prison, including the provision of a stand-alone women's prison has been approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Options regarding improved accommodation for prisoners currently housed in the E Block of Portlaoise Prison continue to be explored. The Joint Irish Prison Service Probation Service Female Strategy commits the Prison Service to exploring the development of an open centre for women prisoners. A sub-group was established to examine where such a facility might be provided within the prison estate. I understand that the sub-group recently submitted its report to the director general of the Prison Service for his consideration. The report of the review group contains 43 recommendations, some of which can be implemented in the short to medium term, while others require a more long-term approach. Last November, the Minister obtained the agreement, in principle, of the Government to proceed with the implementation of the following recommendations: the introduction of legislative proposals to establish the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis; preparation of proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy, including a review of the threshold at which presumptive minimum sentences in drugs and other offences apply; preparation of proposals for Government on legislating for the review's recommendation that courts set out in writing their reasons for imposing a custodial sentence; and preparation of proposals on the potential for increased use of earned remission and pursuance of options for an open prison for female offenders. Work to progress the implementation of these decisions is under way. Following consideration of the review group report by Government, the Minister referred it to the joint committee which broadly welcomed many aspects of it. While the committee expressed disappointment that the review did not include its recommendation on increasing standard remission, I understand it did accept that this could lead to altering or increasing relevant sentences of imprisonment. The Minister notes the committee's call for her Department to increase its capacity for research and optimise data collection. This proposal is currently being looked at. In its reply the committee also referred to its report on the use and effectiveness of community courts and the recommendation that a trial community court be established in Dublin city to deal with summary and petty offences. The review group also made a recommendation on community courts. The committee report provides a starting point to consider whether the community court model can be of benefit to the Irish criminal justice system. The Minister has already stated that a considerable amount of preparatory work needs to be undertaken in collaboration with all stakeholders before a pilot project can be established. When the matter has been fully examined, she intends to bring forward proposals on the establishment of a community court in Dublin city on a pilot basis. The review group recommended the establishment of a group that would report every six months to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the implementation of the report. The Minister recently announced the establishment of a penal policy implementation oversight group chaired by Dr. Mary Rogan, head of law at Dublin Institute of Technology. Dr. Rogan was a member of the review group and as such has a deep knowledge of the issues addressed in the report. Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality will shortly meet Dr. Rogan to discuss membership of the group and the mechanics of its operation. Separately, the Department has set up an internal cross-divisional working group to co-ordinate and take forward the implementation of the report's recommendations. Much progress already has been made in terms of some of the recommendations of both reports and the progress to date provides us with a firm base from which to proceed with future reform. Both reports are important contributions to the debate on penal reform. They provide us with a road-map for the future and will be an invaluable source of advice to the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Government and everyone interested in making progressive and effective changes to penal policy. The Minister looks forward to working with Government colleagues, members of the joint committee and others in achieving that goal and hopes she can count on their active support and guidance as she works towards implementing real and meaningful change.The Deputy made a reference to working harder to keep people out of prison. An article by Neil Gaiman, in The Guardian on 16 October 2013, had a major effect on my position on policing, community, the drugs crisis and literacy, in particular:I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners are there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could predict it very easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage of 10 and 11-year-olds couldn't read.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. I have listened carefully to the range of views expressed on this important subject. I am grateful for the constructive suggestions on what we could do to progress real and meaningful penal reform. The first concern of the Minister for Justice and Equality is public protection and safety, reducing reoffending and helping to make communities safer for everyone. She is committed to having a programme of comprehensive reform in the administration of criminal justice, including, in particular, reform of prison and penal policy. She believes this reform will contribute to having a safer, more efficient and equitable criminal justice system. In that regard, she very much welcomes the Inspector of Prisons' independent review of the Irish Prison Service. The review will focus on cultural issues within the service. It is timely and will build on the significant progress made in recent years. While much has been done to address the many issues which have adversely affected the prison system for many years, the Minister believes more can and should be done. Like the inspector, she wants to ensure everything possible is done to reinforce a positive culture at every level of the service. She looks forward to receiving the inspector’s report in six months time and is confident that it will make a positive contribution to reforms already under way in the service. There is much commonality in the report of the joint committee on penal reform and the report of the penal policy review group. Both reports are important and the Minister is anxious to press ahead with action on foot of the recommendations of the review group with the aim, as the report states, of developing and sustaining a just, proportionate and humane penal system which will contribute to the overall goal of reducing the level of offending. The Minister is confident that implementation of the recommendations of the review group, supported by the report of the joint committee, will make a real difference in contributing to future policy and practice. I assure the House of her commitment to a programme of comprehensive reforms in the administration of criminal justice, in particular reform of prison and penal policy. She believes this reform will contribute to a safer, more efficient and equitable criminal justice system.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Deputy Mitchell O’Connor for raising this important matter, a subject which is a priority for the Minister. The Legal Aid Board provides legal services for persons of limited means in certain civil matters subject to a financial eligibility and a merits test. I am informed by the board that domestic violence cases are treated as a priority and, as such, processed without delay. A contribution may be payable by the applicant. However, applicants can apply for a waiver if it would cause hardship to pay it. Such applications are invariably granted in domestic violence cases to ensure this would not cause a delay in providing services. Legal services are provided through an extensive network of law centres or via a private practitioner panel.Domestic violence cases are referred to a solicitor on that panel if one is not available within the law centre in order to avoid any delay in providing legal services. I have been assured that the board is not aware of any undue delay in the provision of legal services by the Legal Aid Board for domestic violence cases but if the Deputy has a specific instance in mind, she might let me or the Minister have the details. Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, endeavours to facilitate co-ordination across the justice, health, housing, education, family support and community sectors. The office drives the implementation of the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Cosc is currently developing a new national strategy which is expected to be published in May or June 2015. Under the strategy, Cosc has run an annual funding programme for awareness raising around the country. Just under €300,000 was provided in funding in 2014. It is expected that around €280,000 will be provided in 2015. Cosc also funds 13 programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence and €484,000 was provided under this in 2014. Work is being undertaken on the preparation of the general scheme of a reformed and consolidated domestic violence Bill. I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to bring the draft general scheme to Government by the end of April. Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that work on the general scheme of a criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill is at an advanced stage. The Bill is expected to be published in mid 2015.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I again thank the Deputy for raising this incredibly important matter. I assure her that domestic abuse and the plight of victims of crime are matters of great importance to the Minister. As the Minister said in her opening remarks in Seanad Éireann on 3 March 2015, the Government is committed to introducing consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation in a way that provides protection to victims. The draft general scheme of the legislation is being finalised and it is intended that it will be considered by Government shortly after Easter. Following approval of the general scheme by the Government, it will be forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence for pre-legislative scrutiny. Work is also continuing on the drafting of a general scheme of a criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill. This Bill is expected to be published in mid-2015. Persons seeking the assistance of the Legal Aid Board regarding domestic violence matters can be assured of the board's commitment to providing a prompt service in this area. I will look at the report. At no time and in no way, should any victim of domestic violence or any other kind of violence in our society ever think that they are being treated as a nuisance at any stage of the criminal justice process. I make a commitment to read that report and I look forward to the Deputy's constructive engagement in the process regarding the legislation the Minister intends to bring before this House shortly.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The Government is firmly committed to combatting and challenging any and all manifestations of racism. Ireland was one of the first states in the world to develop a national action plan against racism. When the National Action Plan against Racism 2005-2008 was launched, it was conceived as a four-year programme to run until the end of 2008. It was designed to provide strategic direction towards developing a more intercultural and inclusive society in Ireland, and was integration-driven. Under the plan, support was provided towards the development of a number of national and local strategies, including greater integration in key role model profession workplaces such as An Garda Síochána, the health service, the education system, the arts and sports sectors and within our local authorities.  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration in my Department is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy. The office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. Many of the initiatives which were instigated through the National Action Plan against Racism 2005-2008 continue to be developed and progressed through the support and work of the office. A review of our approach to the integration of migrants was launched last year. This review will provide the basis for a new and updated migrant integration strategy. Work on the integration strategy is ongoing and a draft will be sent to key stakeholders for their observations before the summer with a view to publication as soon as possible thereafter. I expect that the integration strategy, when developed, will include a strong anti-racism component.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from. Last night in the Seanad I said that we should be reasonably satisfied, without being complacent in any way, that the political system and political debate in this country have not been strangled by the issue of immigration. If one looks at what is happening in the UK and across Europe at the moment, one can see that xenophobic tendencies are getting into the mainstream and immigration is at the heart of political debate in election campaigns. We have to tackle the issue of racism, but the issue of integration is, to my mind, closely associated with it. We have asked sports clubs to have anti-racism strategies when applying for sports capital grants. That is not enough any more. Sports clubs, and all those in society, need to find strategies to positively interact and reach out, and they need to have integration strategies. Having reactions to particular negative incidents is fine and well and important. However, it is much more challenging for Irish society or aspects of Irish society to reach out. That is why having people of different ethnic backgrounds in key role model professions is also very important.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Deputy's comments. Work is ongoing in respect of Traveller ethnicity, direct provision, integration and interaction. Yesterday there was positive interaction with the Deputy's committee.One of the points I am quite keen to pursue under the integration strategy relates to young people. Obviously, a number of young people are between two identities at the moment. They might have come here as migrants or might be the children of migrants. They are now trying to come to terms with being between two identities. I am keen to use that as a positive factor in society in order that people are comfortable with being Irish-Nigerian, Irish-Polish or Irish-Moldovan. We need to ensure we do not make the mistakes made by other countries 50 years ago when they had their first influx of migrants. For example, we can galvanise what is best about the identities of young people who often feel alienated from the mainstream of society and move forward from there. If we make mistakes now, we will reap a whirlwind of discontent for years to come. The needs of the education sector are at the heart of the integration strategy. The challenges faced by young people are of key importance in that context.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«As stressed strongly by my ministerial colleagues in the debate on the counter motion last evening, the fundamental philosophy of the Government has been to improve the lives of people and protect the most vulnerable, while at the same time creating conditions that will allow the economy to grow in order that the curse of unemployment, inherited from the previous Government, is lifted from the people. The debate is timely in reminding ourselves what has happened in terms of how the economy has been turned around and what the Government has done to protect the most vulnerable during the crisis and how it has brought forward measures to reduce inequality during that period. The Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the well-being of lower-paid workers. On taking office, it restored the national minimum wage from €7.65 to €8.65. It introduced legislation to restore the joint labour committee system and enacted the Temporary Agency Workers Bill 2012 to protect temporary agency workers. It provided collective representation rights for retirees in terms of access to trustees to ensure their collective voice would be heard when the trustees were considering amendments to a particular scheme. Having returned the economy to sustainable growth through transformational policies implemented on the twin tracks of An Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, the Government is determined to ensure the benefits of the recovery are felt by all in society, both nationally and regionally. Making work pay, enhancing dignity at work and reducing inequality are cornerstones of the Government's agenda. Its commitment to pursue an extensive industrial relations and employment rights reform agenda continues. We have established the Low Pay Commission to make annual recommendations to the Government on the national minimum wage and related matters. The commission will report to it within the next 12 weeks. We are introducing legislation to provide a revised legislative framework to replace REAs. This legislation will be published within the next few weeks. We are conducting a study of the prevalence of zero-hour and low-hour contracts and their impact on employees. The study will be completed as a matter of priority and the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will act quickly on foot of the report. As regards collective bargaining, a focus of the debate last night, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to reform the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. It will provide for an improved and constitutionally robust industrial relations framework that will provide greater clarity for employers. It will ensure that, where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining, either with a trade union or an internal excepted body, the 2001 Act will be remediated to ensure there is an effective means for a union, on behalf of members in that employment, to have disputed remuneration, terms and conditions assessed against relevant comparators and determined by the Labour Court, if necessary. Such a determination will be enforceable in the Circuit Court. In addition - this issue was raised last night by Members on the Opposition side - the legislation will contain strong anti-victimisation provisions to protect workers who may believe they are being victimised for exercising their rights under it, including the introduction of interim relief against unfair dismissal. Given the concerns expressed last night, the Government looks forward to receiving the full support of the House in moving these measures along, as they are part of its dignity at work agenda. It is clear that the Government is succeeding in turning the economy around and improving the lives of citizens. Unemployment is down to 10%. Almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first action plan for jobs in 2012 and the increase has been in full-time rather than casual or temporary jobs. It is also clear that the Government has demonstrated its commitment to maintaining and improving employment rights, as well as reforming and enhancing both the industrial relations institutions of the State and the industrial relations framework utilised by workers and employers. I acknowledge those who have made positive contributions to the debate on the motion. The Government intends to press ahead with its programme of work with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable workers. It will be seeking the support of the House to ensure the key legislative measures to which I have referred can be passed into law in the months ahead.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As he will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda regions, divisions and districts. Garda management keeps this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources. The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to resourcing An Garda Síochána. Restarting recruitment was a key priority and we started to deliver on this last September with the first recruitment of new gardaí since 2009. From September 2014 to the end of this year, the number of new recruits entering Templemore will total 550. I assure the Deputy that the Minister is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner regarding the overall response to the problem of anti­social behaviour. A key priority for the Garda is to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and to enhance community safety. This approach includes a strong focus on quality-of-life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti­social behaviour. A range of strong legislative provisions is in place. These include measures under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. The Garda has powers to deal with anti-social conduct that is attributable to excessive drinking, including through exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders in respect of licensed premises and catering outlets. The Deputy alluded to one such premises in Mullingar. In addition, gardaí have powers to seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property or where a person is under age. Where anti-social behaviour is directed at property, the Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for a range of offences and penalties, including imprisonment for a term of up to ten years upon conviction. The existing provisions provide the Garda with a wide range of powers to deal with offences associated with anti-social behaviour, including juvenile and adult cautions, fixed-charge penalty notices and the bringing of prosecutions. There are also provisions under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 for civil proceedings in respect of anti-social behaviour by adults and specific provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour by children. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour. In engaging with the Garda Commissioner on these issues, the Minister has asked her whether there are further legislative options we might consider that would be of assistance to the Garda. We are actively considering legislative measures.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am trying to read between the lines of what the Deputy is saying. It seems to me he is touching on rather dangerous ground if he is attempting to pit one community against another. We must be very careful as to how we describe issues within communities. If we set out to address anti-social behaviour purely as a policing issue, then we miss the point almost entirely. As I said in my reply, An Garda Síochána and other agencies are constantly working on strategies to empower communities. Where anti-social behaviour occurs, it is clear evidence that there already has been a failure right across the board. I had a meeting this morning with representatives of YoungBallymun to discuss the advancement of the area-based child poverty, ABC, initiative, with which the Deputy will be familiar from his work as party spokesperson on children. The whole point of that programme is to empower parents and communities to look more profoundly at the issues that affect them, including issues around parenting and advancements in education. If the only response from parliamentarians to anti-social behaviour is a legislative or policing one, that is to miss the point. Of course we must be strong in defending our streets and towns against anti-social behaviour, but working out the reason that behaviour is happening is often the more difficult question to answer. That is why policy makers often shirk from answering it. We need to investigate more deeply why these incidents take place. In my own constituency there are instances of endemic anti-social behaviour. We can put 100, 200 or 300 gardaí out patrolling estates and they may deter some people from engaging in such behaviour, but the incentive to engage in it is still there. We must ask ourselves why that is the case. Why are young men and women from certain backgrounds and in certain areas not getting enough empowerment from mainstream society? Why are they seeking empowerment through these types of activities? I take the Deputy's points very seriously. I am sure he is anxious, as am I, to hear what the Garda Commissioner has to say in response to the approaches the Minister has made to her. However, I would caution anybody against moving potentially onto dangerous ground by pitting one community against another.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets she is unable to be present for the debate due to other official commitments. I will bring the views of the Deputies to her attention. Without wanting to comment on the specific circumstances of any particular case, the Minister is very much aware of the strain that can arise for individuals and their families when their personal or business finances become distressed. In these circumstances, repossession of a home or other property inevitably brings those pressures to a head. As public representatives, we have all engaged with people struggling in these circumstances, and it is undoubtedly one of the most tangible legacies of the national economic mismanagement which this Government has been grappling with. This Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions. This included an extensive suite of interventions designed to address the problem, including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART. In addition, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears produced by the Central Bank sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in, or facing, mortgage arrears. We have also seen the extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, including the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the introduction of the personal insolvency agreement model. In addition, we have enhanced the provision of advice through initiatives led by Department of Social Protection. Furthermore, the mortgage to rent scheme has been put in place to assist borrowers who are in an unsustainable mortgage position in remaining in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies. I call attention to the review of the insolvency legislation announced as part of the statement of Government priorities. This involved consultations with all the relevant stakeholders and has been completed by the Department of Justice and Equality. Work is currently under way across Government Departments to develop a comprehensive and effective response to help those trapped in unsustainable debt to arrive at sustainable solutions. That work is expected to conclude shortly, and the Government's action plan in this area will be announced. The Minister is conscious of the painful situations that have arisen for families and farm and business owners, a number of which have been raised specifically with her as Minister. As these cases are matters that have been, or are, before the courts, it would not be appropriate for her to comment on their specifics. In response to the issues raised by the Deputies concerning the need for Garda guidelines on repossessions, it is important to be clear about the role and functions of members of the Garda Síochána in these circumstances. The proceedings that give rise to repossessions are first and foremost civil proceedings in which the Garda Síochána is not a party. There may be situations in which the Garda Síochána becomes aware, or is notified, that a property is to be the subject of enforcement proceedings on foot of a court order. In those circumstances, it is an operational matter for Garda Síochána management to assess whether a Garda Síochána presence is advisable so as to prevent any risk of a breach of the peace. Preserving public order is an essential function of the Garda Síochána, whether in circumstances relating to repossession or otherwise. Where the Garda Síochána attends in those circumstances, it is equally important to be clear that it does not have a role in the repossession process itself, unless specific actions are directed by the court, and is not in a position to act as an arbiter in the proceedings. There may be confusion on this point in the public mind, but this is the legal position and the Garda Síochána is clear about this when present in such circumstances. Issues of difference or difficulty concerning the enforcement of the order are matters for the parties to resolve before the courts. Where a breach of the peace occurs, there are of course provisions in public order and other legislation that may apply. Similarly, where an individual has concerns that a criminal action may be have been committed by any person in the course of such proceedings, this is a matter that the Garda Síochána will investigate. Furthermore, if a person feels he or she has grounds for complaint about the actions of a member of An Garda Síochána in this or any other matter, it can be pursued through a complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The Minister has no function with regard to persons appointed to execute court orders who are operating under the aegis of the courts. In conclusion, the Minister underlines that, as a matter of general Government policy, the effective management of the mortgage arrears challenges remains under continuous review. More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears. As the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that the Deputies accept the role of the Garda in these circumstances. They have outlined to me a situation in which 30 or more individuals dressed in dark clothing moved across a rural community in the dead of night. This appears to be an unacceptable situation, to say the very least. The Deputies' points are well made. They are very reasonable. Such a scenario, if it were to be repeated, would naturally cause concern, not just in that community but also in other communities. People need to know where the law lies in this regard. I will make a personal commitment to the Deputies to pass on the seriousness of the Deputies' feelings on this matter, to outline the circumstances they have described and to ensure the Minister responds to them in due course.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, and also the Minister for Defence, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Industrial Relations (Members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces) Bill 2015 which has been introduced by Deputy Michael McNamara. Unfortunately, neither the Minister for Justice and Equality nor the Minister for Defence can be here today to address the House due to a prior engagement elsewhere. I congratulate and thank Deputy McNamara for bringing this important issue to the House today. This Bill forms part of a broader current debate on the future of the industrial relations architecture in the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. In that regard, this Second Stage debate allows for a timely discussion on this matter and the various sensitivities and complexities which arise. I again thank Deputy McNamara for giving us this opportunity for debate. While it is important that we discuss such matters in this House, I am sure Deputies on all sides will recognise that debate and dialogues must also be had at other levels, particularly with the parties involved, including the various Garda and Defence Forces staff representative bodies. This process is under way and will continue. The points raised in this debate today will inform that broader process of consideration. In debating these issues, it is important to understand the existing arrangements for industrial relations in the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, and I will deal first with the Garda Síochána. Section 18 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment, in accordance with regulations, of Garda associations for the purpose of representing members of the Garda Síochána below the rank of Assistant Commissioner in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency. This includes pay, pensions and conditions of service. There was a similar provision for Garda associations in previous Garda legislation going back to 1923. Regulations establishing the Garda Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the Association of Garda Superintendents and the Association of Chief Superintendents have been in place for several years. As Deputies are aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has addressed, or is yet to address, the conferences of some of these various associations. This is in addition to the very positive constructive engagement between the Minister and the associations, including a substantial number of meetings over the past year, which included discussions on a broad range of issues. I know the Minister has welcomed this engagement in terms of allowing important discussion of industrial relations issues but also in providing a forum for feedback on key policing practice issues from front-line gardaí and local managers. With regard to the question of Garda associations associating with a body outside the Garda Síochána, it should be noted that a general prohibition exists in section 18 of the 2005 Act. While this prohibition is the default position, it is important to note that the Minister for Justice and Equality may, notwithstanding this, authorise an association with an outside body, and in doing so may specify conditions or restrictions in respect of such an authorisation. In effect, Garda associates may not associate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, or any other umbrella body for employees. Instead, the Garda associations represent their members' interests in negotiations on terms and conditions at the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Council. In addition to this formal process, there is a less formal partnership process in place in the Garda Síochána which manages industrial relations issues at a local level, and, where possible, settles these issues before the need arises to present them formally at the conciliation council. In respect of the right to strike, while there is no single specific prohibition on striking by members of the Garda Síochána, a combination of provisions in law, including the Industrial Relations Act 1990, as well as Garda discipline regulations, effectively precludes strikes. Regarding central pay talks, the Garda associations, because they have not been authorised to associate with ICTU, have in the past not been represented by the public service committee of ICTU in such talks. Instead, parallel bilateral discussions have been held with the Garda associations and the Defence Forces associations. Those are the current industrial relations arrangements for the Garda Síochána. A review of the Garda Síochána is under way under the Haddington Road agreement, and this review encompasses "the appropriate structures and mechanisms for the resolution of matters relating to pay, industrial relations and attendance matters". The impetus for this Bill, or at least the Garda-related parts of the Bill, is a finding last year by the European Committee of Social Rights, ECSR, a Council of Europe body, that three aspects of the current arrangements are not in compliance with the European Social Charter: the prohibition on Garda representative associations joining national employees' organisations; the restricted access of Garda representative associations into pay agreement discussions; and the prohibition on the right to strike of members of the Garda Síochána. The Bill seeks to respond to these findings by providing a right for Garda and Defence Forces representatives to carry on negotiations for the fixing of pay or other conditions of employment of their members; by allowing those associations to join a national umbrella organisation of employees; and by providing a right to strike for members of the Garda Síochána. It is important to understand that, while the State of course subscribes to the principles set out in the European Social Charter, these findings are not legally binding on the State. In a response to these findings, the State has said that it takes careful note of them and has undertaken to carefully consider them. In this context, it has pointed out that, as I mentioned, there is a review of the Garda Síochána under way under the Haddington Road agreement, and that this review encompasses appropriate structures and mechanisms for the resolution of matters relating to pay, industrial relations and attendance matters. As committed by the State, the findings of the ECSR, together with all other relevant issues, are being taken into account as part of this ongoing process. The State did, however, emphasise that the Garda Síochána provided security and intelligence services as well as policing in the State, and that it was critically important that these services were fully operational at all times. It made it clear, therefore, that giving members of the Garda Síochána the right to strike would raise the most serious issues in respect of the capacity of the State to ensure the maintenance of law and order. In this context the State noted the narrow margin within the ECSR by which this particular finding was made, as well as the strong dissenting opinions put forward, and emphasised that this was a particularly difficult and sensitive issue which raised complex questions from a legal, operational and management perspective. The State did, however, undertake to keep these findings under review and to report developments to the ECSR. Apart from considering issues around a right to strike, I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality is actively exploring how best to respond to the findings relating to the association of Garda representative bodies with ICTU and the access of the Garda associations to central pay talks. The two issues are connected and require careful consideration. As outlined, however, the Minister and the Department have been engaging, and will continue to engage, with the Garda associations on these issues. The Minister is committed to this ongoing constructive process of engagement and dialogue, which should be let run its course. One other Garda-related matter dealt with in the Bill is that it seeks to ensure that any member of the Garda Síochána who becomes, or applies to become, a party to an insolvency arrangement will not on that account fall foul of Garda discipline regulations. However, it is important to look at exactly what those regulations say. They provide that it is a breach of discipline for a Garda to fail wilfully and without good and sufficient cause to pay any lawful debt in such circumstances as to be liable to affect his or her ability to discharge his or her duties as a member or as to be liable to compromise other members.In other words, getting into debt or falling behind with mortgage payments is not a disciplinary matter. I am not aware of anything in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 or the Garda discipline regulations that prevents a member of An Garda Síochána from availing of the services of Insolvency Ireland. I now wish to focus on issues affecting members of the Defence Forces, specifically issues relating to the Defence Forces representative associations. I will outline for the House the arrangements currently in place for the members of the Permanent Defence Force. The current industrial relations arrangements already permit members of the Permanent Defence Force the freedom of association and the right to join a professional representative association, such as RACO or PDFORRA, to represent their interests. In order to compensate for the prohibition of affiliation to ICTU, alternative mechanisms and rights of association are already in place, through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. This scheme provides the representative associations with structures and processes to enable representations and negotiations to take place on behalf of their members. The scheme, which is similar to the Civil Service scheme and those in other parts of the public service, provides the mechanism for direct negotiation and discussions with both civil and military management and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It provides a mechanism through which consultations with the associations can be carried out and a means for both sides to discuss issues of importance to them and to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. Where solutions cannot be resolved, there is access to a third party process, such as facilitation, adjudication and arbitration, if required. The associations play a valuable role in representing their members' interests, including negotiation on terms and conditions of employment and pay for their members. They promote the welfare of individual members by pursuing grievances on their behalf and represent their interests at different levels, from unit level upward and consult and negotiate on collective conditions of service in the military. In addition, discussions with the representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, in parallel with discussions being undertaken by the official side of ICTU affiliated unions, are already required under the terms of the public service agreements 2010-2016. Under these parallel process arrangements, representatives of the Department of Defence, military management, the Department of An Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform meet separately and collectively with both representative associations. I would now like to speak specifically on the Bill before the House. While it is welcome that the Bill does not explicitly seek to remove the prohibition of the right to strike by members of the Defences Forces, an unforeseen consequence of the enabling provisions contained in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, which would allow the representative associations of the Permanent Defence Force to join ICTU, poses a serious difficulty in regard to the stated first objective of the ICTU constitution. This first objective is "to uphold the democratic character and structure of the Trade Union Movement, to maintain the right of freedom of association and the right of workers to organise and negotiate and all such rights as are necessary to the performance of trade union functions and in particular, the right to strike". In this regard, Article 4 of the ICTU constitution requires that members of congress shall satisfy the executive council that its rules, objectives and policy are in harmony with the constitution of congress and undertake to abide by its provisions. This is clearly not tenable where it relates to the Permanent Defence Force as the State's last line of defence. The Defence Forces must be fully operational at all times. In circumstances where the Defence Forces could be called upon to aid the civil authority, as has happened in the past, the potential for serious difficulties could arise in these circumstances if the representative associations were affiliated to ICTU, as clear conflict of objectives and policy then arise. The Deputy will also appreciate that the issue of ICTU membership for the Permanent Defence Force representative associations raises complex questions from a legal, operational and management perspective. In this context, it is critical to remember that the legal barriers in place for military personnel are legitimate and proportionate to legitimate State interests; they are not arbitrary and are prescribed by law. First, they limit the representative associations to members of the Defence Forces and are not linked to trade unions. Second, legal barriers are in place to forbid strikes or other forms of industrial action that could disrupt operations or threaten security. Access to ICTU potentially raises the issue of members of the Permanent Defence Force having to cross picket lines. This would be inconsistent with the objectives and policy of ICTU, in particular the right to strike. As such, it could disrupt vital operations in a way that threatens national security or could disrupt operations. It is worth repeating again that military personnel are the last line of defence. Even if the Permanent Defence Force representative associations were allowed access to ICTU on an affiliate level, or voluntarily to forswear industrial action, this might not prohibit secondary industrial action by another union in support of the representative associations' cause. The current arrangements already permit members of the Permanent Defence Force the freedom of association and the right to join a professional representative association to represent their interests. These associations already enjoy the right to be consulted in discussions concerning conditions of service or pay for members of the Permanent Defence Force. The differences in treatment or limitations, such as the prohibition on affiliation to a body such as ICTU, are not unique to Ireland and Ireland is not unique in imposing limitations on the rights of association for military personnel. Indeed, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, has recognised that it is common in many countries for the freedom of association of public servants, including members of the Defence Forces to be limited. For example, in Poland there is a ban on trade unions in the military, but like Ireland they have a right to form a representative association and have conciliation arrangements. They are also prohibited from the right to strike. Similarly, in Hungary, Germany, Romania, Belgium and Sweden, members of the military forces are legally prohibited from engaging in certain forms of industrial action, especially strikes. In this context, it must be emphasised that the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military law. If the representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force were granted access to an association of trade unions, such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as in proposed in sections 2 and 3 of this Bill, that would clearly pose a distinct problem in terms of military discipline and possible interference with esprit de corps. The Deputy will appreciate that the disciplined nature of the Defence Forces requires that military orders must be obeyed. Of the two representative associations for members of the Permanent Defence Force, the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers, RACO, has advised the Minister for Defence that it does not wish to join ICTU. The other, the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, has previously made representations to the Minister of Defence on this issue, most recently earlier this year. On each occasion, its application for affiliation to ICTU was declined by the Minister for Defence. The primary concern then, which still pertains, is that any form of industrial action is considered irreconcilable with military service. The unionisation of military personnel is viewed as conflicting with the unique nature of the military and its role in maintaining national security and public order. The Deputy will be aware that following the recent case brought to the European Committee of Social Rights by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, a complaint to the committee about the limitation on union rights for military representative associations in Ireland has now been made by EUROMIL, a European umbrella body for military associations, on behalf of PDFORRA. The PDFORRA association is claiming most of the same violations of the European Social Charter as claimed by AGSI, including denial of the right to join the ICTU, alleged restricted access to pay talks and the prohibition on the right to strike. As the question of admissibility of the EUROMIL complaint is currently under consideration by the European Committee of Social Rights, it is the Government's position to await the outcome of the complaint made to the committee. 
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«It is a shame that Deputy Calleary cannot stay for the remainder of the debate, as I was going to respond to some of his points. However, seeing as it is Friday morning, I will leave the political footballing for another time. The House will see that in respect of the members of An Garda Síochána, the Government currently has the main issue raised in this Bill under detailed consideration. This consideration is being informed by ongoing engagement and dialogue with the Garda associations. There is potential for progress to be made on links to a national employee organisation and on access to central pay negotiations. These issues are under active examination. It is also the case that industrial relations matters are the subject of a review of An Garda Síochána which is still under way, and it is clear that it would be best to await the outcome of that review.  There is no disguising the difficult and sensitive issues raised by the proposal that members of An Garda Síochána should have the right to strike. I hope Deputies on both sides of this House will recognise that these issues require careful consideration of all of the issues involved. Similarly, as I have said, the proposals relating to the Defence Forces associations also raise complex difficulties from a legal, operational and management perspective. It is important that matters of such importance are debated in our national parliament. The Minister for Justice and Equality and I are committed to continuing to work with interested Deputies as the broader ongoing process of dialogue and consideration of these issues continues.  I thank Deputy McNamara again for his interest in this matter and for providing us with this opportunity for debate. While I am not in a position to accept the Bill as it stands, I look forward to the contributions from all sides and I hope the Deputy understands the policy positions as set out and recognises the current context.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The Minister for Justice and Equality, who introduced the Bill in this House last evening, regrets that she is unable to be here today and I am pleased to stand in for her for the remainder of the debate. On behalf of the Minister, I wish to thank the House for giving its time to this most important matter. I thank Deputies for their contributions, comments and general if not unanimous support for this important legislation. It is clear that there is a shared determination to combat terrorism, in all its forms and at all stages. This Bill strengthens our hand in this regard by further developing and enhancing existing counter-terrorism legislation. It focuses on the more subtle, indirect and insidious aspects of modern terrorism, namely, public provocation, recruitment and training. The Bill makes it an offence to engage in any of these preparatory activities and provides strong penalties for those found guilty of them, including up to ten years imprisonment if the crime is sufficiently serious. We continue to learn that events far from our shores may have an impact on us domestically. Thankfully, Ireland has not experienced any of the horrendous attacks experienced in other European member states, yet we must never be complacent. This legislation will add to Ireland's ability to deal with the threat from terrorism both domestically and internationally. While we have not yet been directly affected, we must, as a long-standing member of the EU, show solidarity with our fellow member states. In that regard, the House can be assured that Ireland will continue to contribute to initiatives in this area from a European perspective also. A number of points of action have been identified as requiring particular priority from an EU perspective. The Minister for Justice and Equality yesterday alluded to the EU passenger name records directive in some detail. Member states also continue to examine other ways in which our security and policing agencies can enhance levels of co-operation and information exchange. Europol has recently proposed the setting up of a counter-terrorism Internet referral unit where police agencies can exchange information on abuses of the Internet for terrorist purposes. This is to be welcomed and An Garda Síochána will continue to co-operate with its international colleagues in this sphere. More also needs to be learned about the individuals financing and supporting terrorism within Europe. The many and circuitous routes foreign fighters take to travel to the combat areas must be identified and greater engagement with non-member states who have a shared interest in these matters must occur. Initiatives in this area are ongoing and being developed. This is a truly international problem. The threat from international terrorism is also undoubtedly a complex one. There was a time when we could point at a specific organisation or structure and take action to reduce its terror capabilities and dismantle its infrastructure. The new nature of terrorism is much more random and the traditional formal organisational and hierarchical structures no longer apply in many cases. The threat becomes more difficult to detect, anticipate and deal with. Many of the attacks we have seen recently are carried out by individuals or small cells of individuals, self-motivated and radicalised. Some have received training in the combat zones of the Middle East. A number of the attacks in France bear this hallmark. The attacks carried out by these
individuals clearly demonstrate the threat posed by the foreign fighter phenomenon. As previously outlined, the Internet has proved a powerful tool for the forces of radicalisation. The EU has identified curbing the use of the Internet for recruitment and radicalisation purposes as another key action requiring attention. The challenge in this area is phenomenal. For example, it is estimated that 300 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Twitter processes 500 million tweets per day. For every site or tweet taken down, there are many more waiting to replace them. Dealing with the abuse of these resources, which are enjoyed by many for legitimate reasons, requires more than simply attempting to remove the offending content or making its presence illegal. It is apparent that the companies offering Internet based and social media services do not view the exploitation of their product by terrorists as desirable. Indeed these companies are engaged in trying to develop ways of addressing the issue. However, the ready availability of this content needs to be questioned. We are not talking about curbing freedoms of expression or speech here. We are simply asking whether this doctrine of hate and intolerance should go unchallenged. Greater engagement with the technology companies and Internet service providers is required. More research is also needed into what content has a genuinely radicalising effect and what does not. Is it, for example, the preaching of radical clerics or, particularly where young people are concerned, simply peer group pressure? Why is it that our modern progressive democracies based on free speech and expression seem so hateful to some of our own citizens? Hard questions need to be asked. Responses need to be developed. Considerable resources have been invested by the EU Commission in the creation of its radicalisation awareness network to examine the issue of radicalisation in all of its facets. These include initiatives in the areas of policing, community relations, prisons, mental health and the technology sectors. Ireland contributes on a number of fronts to the workings of this network. It is obviously very important to have international co-operation, strong security measures and empowering legislation to deal with the terrorist threat. A purely law enforcement based approach will not, however, sufficiently address radicalisation and violent extremism. It is also necessary to have policies and initiatives in place at national level that serve to discourage people from being drawn into extremist activity and to protect communities that may be at risk from radical sources. The best prevention is to stop people from getting involved in anti-social, violent or terrorist activity in the first place and to convince them to turn away from such behaviour. There is a need for meaningful engagement with communities who may be under threat from radical sources.  An important part of this process is avoiding any sense of profiling or stigmatising sectors of the population. The protection of fundamental rights and the recognition that the majority of people want to live peaceably and play a productive part in society are enshrined in this engagement. Integration of all of our citizens in our society - their society - has a very important role to play in this regard. A good example of a proactive approach in engaging with our minority communities is the work of the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office to which the Minister referred yesterday in her opening speech. On the subject of integration and inclusiveness, the office for the promotion of migrant integration in the Department of Justice and Equality is in the process of developing a new strategy on migrant integration. This follows a lengthy consultation process with a wide range of groups representing migrants throughout society. This process of engagement is very important not just in the context of seeking to prevent seditious activity, but in the general spirit of inclusiveness for all of our citizens in our democratic society. In his contribution on the Bill last evening, Deputy Collins inquired as to what action could be taken on Irish citizens engaging in foreign fighting. The Passports Act 2008 contains provisions under which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade can refuse or cancel a passport. Should the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality and-or the Minister for Defence, as appropriate, form the opinion that a person would be likely to engage in conduct that would prejudice national security or the security of another state, the Minister may cancel a passport already issued to an Irish citizen. A cancelled passport must be surrendered to the Minister. A person who uses or attempts to use a cancelled passport is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years. In addition, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides for the revocation of citizenship of naturalised persons in certain circumstances. In the event of any information being brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality which should have been disclosed by a naturalised citizen, the Minister can invoke the statutory process which exists for the consideration of revocation of citizenship. I understand, however, that the revocation of citizenship is not an entirely straightforward matter. Such cases would have to be handled on a case by case basis, in consultation with the State's legal services. Certain factors would have to be taken into account, such as whether the person has dual citizenship and whether he or she has already re-entered the country. Under the relevant legislation the subject has the right to appeal to a statutory committee which then considers the matter in full and reports its findings to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will then decide on the matter. There is considerable concern throughout Europe and elsewhere at the phenomenon of individuals travelling to conflict areas in the Middle East and the consequential threat posed to national security. While the number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones is estimated at between 25 and 30, within this number are individuals who travelled to Libya and other Arab states to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010. Some of these individuals are known to have returned and three died in the conflicts. In Ireland, the Garda Síochána monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour, and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas. For obvious reasons it is not possible to be any more specific than this. Dealing with, and discouraging, extremist and terrorist activity is obviously very different from discouraging or suppressing legitimate rights to freedom of speech or the expression of opinions and political ideologies. It is vital in a democratic world that the right to express views and beliefs, sometimes outside the mainstream, is protected and that journalists, for instance, are free to voice their commentary. Such fundamental human rights should not be compromised, as to do so would play into the hands of extremists who would seek to forcibly deprive us of these rights. I will turn to specific questions asked by Deputies. Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked about the delay in the transposition of the amending Council framework decision on combating terrorism. Transposition of EU legislation is, unfortunately, often delayed not due to any lack of commitment or willingness on Government's part, but due to the volume of legislation produced by the EU and to competing demands with domestic legislation. It is a question of prioritisation and I expect that the Bill will be enacted very shortly. Deputies asked why the definition of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity" in the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 are so broad. The 2008 framework decision, to which this legislation gives effect, provides for the addition of three new offences to the definition of "terrorist linked activity" in the 2005 Act. All member states agree these new offences should be included in any definition of terrorist linked activity at this time, thereby building on the existing offences contained in the 2005 Act. Existing offences covered by the definitions of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity" are set out in Schedule 2 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005. The Schedule lists the offences which, with the requisite intent, would constitute terrorist offences. These include common law offences such as murder and rape; offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997; offences under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; offences under the Explosives Substances Act 1883; and offences under the Firearms Acts and Chemical Weapons Act, to name but a few. In this way, only the most serious offences are covered in our legislation by the definitions of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity". In response to the points raised by Deputies Daly and Murphy, section 6(5) of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 provides that where persons engage in protest, advocacy or dissent it does not in and of itself constitute a terrorist offence. The Government has repeatedly made it clear that extraordinary rendition is an illegal practice which Ireland does not accept, and there is no question of the State having been complicit in the practice of extraordinary rendition. Any person with credible information that Irish airports are being used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to An Garda Síochána. Deputy Mitchell mentioned Ireland's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. One of the purposes of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify this convention. Work will begin on this process following the enactment of this legislation. I note that an amendment on data protection and onward transfer will be tabled by Deputy Mac Lochlainn on Committee Stage and we will address this next week. The Bill will ensure there are no gaps in our laws that can be exploited by those who would seek to inflict terror and mayhem on innocent people at home and abroad. We must ensure there can be no hiding place in democratic society for those who encourage, recruit or train others to carry out acts of terrorism and we must never relent in our determination to use all resources at our disposal to root them out. This is not just a fight against terrorism and intolerance. It is a battle for hearts and minds, and the House can rest assured that Ireland will continue to play its part. On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets she cannot be present due to other official commitments. She is grateful to the Deputies for raising this important matter in the House, one of importance not just for Kildare, but for the country and society as a whole. The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputies that she is, of course, aware of the threats made against members of An Garda Síochána in County Kildare. I have no doubt that every Member of this House will share the Minister's view, and mine, that such actions are to be roundly condemned. I know that we also all appreciate how important it is that we discuss this issue in a manner which does not heighten the distress for those impacted and their families. It is, regrettably, also the case that the issue of intimidation of gardaí going about their duty is not confined to the instances referred to by the Deputies. An Garda Síochána plays a key role in keeping citizens and communities safe and secure. On our behalf, day in, day out, individual gardaí carry out challenging, demanding and sometimes dangerous tasks in the course of their duty. In doing that, gardaí are deserving of the support they get from the communities they serve. The Minister knows that individual gardaí, in the best traditions of the force, will not be intimidated from carrying out their duties and will continue to do so without fear or favour. As the House will understand, it would neither be wise nor appropriate for the Minister to detail the operational measures the Garda authorities have taken or would take generally in these situations. I can say on her behalf, however, that she has asked to be kept briefed by the Garda Commissioner in relation to the specific circumstances at issue. She is aware that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken. The individual safety of gardaí is a priority for the Garda authorities, as it is for all of us. While the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, I should also say that there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against gardaí. In so far as the question of resources for policing generally in Kildare is concerned, the Deputies will appreciate that the deployment of personnel across the State is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I can advise them that the number of gardaí assigned to the division as of 31 March was 299 gardaí, of which 73 were in the Leixlip district, which includes Carbury Garda station where five gardaí were assigned. Two additional Garda personnel have been allocated to Carbury in recent times. The allocation of overall Garda resources is kept under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure resources are put to the best possible use. For the Minister and the Government's part, however, the key point is that thanks to the resumption of recruitment, the Garda Commissioner now has the capacity to deploy new gardaí for the first time since 2009. In fact, on 8 May, five new probationer gardaí are due to transfer to the Kildare Garda division. Similarly, investments are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff. Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda divisions. This investment demonstrates the commitment of the Minister and the Government to supporting the Garda in carrying out its duties, including in the ongoing fight against organised and serious crime. We have not been under any illusion about the depths to which those involved in this type of criminality will sink. The latest incidents reinforces that and An Garda Síochána will continue to confront, disrupt and bring to justice those involved, on behalf of all law-abiding citizens.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister, I again thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I will share the points that have been made with her. As I said, the Minister has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the necessary and appropriate actions are being taken in response to the threats that have been made, as we would all expect. There is no question of resources constraining the operational response to the threats. The management of policing in Kildare, as elsewhere, is of course a matter for the Garda authorities but the Government is doing all it can to ensure they have the resources to do so effectively. While the Minister is aware that the possibility of a new station at Carbury has been raised, she is advised by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to open an additional Garda station in the area. Ultimately, they are questions for Garda management to assess in terms of how policing can be most effectively managed and organised. The vast majority of law-abiding people in County Kildare, and all over the country, support the work of An Garda Síochána, and all will no doubt be appalled at these recent incidents and will join us in supporting the steps being taken to tackle those responsible. I thank the Deputies for raising the matters which I will discuss with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2014, introduced by my colleague, Deputy Eamonn Maloney, and commend him on the work he has put into this measure. Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot be here today to address the House due to a prior engagement elsewhere. As Deputy Maloney has said, I am delighted to make a contribution because of my recent appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, which has a great connection with this area. It is right to acknowledge the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, as has already been mentioned. The bureau has been at the forefront of the fight against organised crime in this jurisdiction since its inception in 1996. The significant successes that the bureau achieves through its operations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach we have taken to pursuing illegally gotten gains, and the bureau has served us well. The Bill before us, while short and succinct, proposes a very significant change to what is a core feature of the non-conviction-based model for confiscation of the proceeds of crime, as set out in the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005. The principle of what the Deputy proposes - that is, a reduction in the statutory freezing period contained in that legislation - is a matter that is currently under review. This work is being undertaken in the context of a broader body of work which is reviewing proceeds of crime legislation in view of a number of matters, including the experience of the Criminal Assets Bureau, relevant court judgments and developments at national and international level in the law pertaining to the proceeds of crime and related matters. As the general thrust of Deputy Maloney's proposal is under consideration, the Government will not be opposing the Bill's reading on Second Stage. However, the House will appreciate that while the focus of this Bill is very narrow, the affected provisions are key to the confiscation model contained in the legislation and are of significant import. It is therefore considered wise not to deal with the Deputy's proposal in isolation from the broader review which is under way and which will examine the legislative scheme in its totality. I will return to this. A court, in assessing the validity of our proceeds of crime provisions, could be expected to look at those provisions in their totality, so clearly the proposal represented by this Bill cannot be looked at in isolation. I will now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. It proposes to substitute a statutory timeframe of two years for the current seven-year statutory timeframe contained in section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act and referenced in section 4(a) of that Act. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, where a court is satisfied that a property represents the proceeds of crime, it may make an interim order ex parte, followed by an interlocutory order on notice, freezing the property identified as proceeds of crime. If the respondent, who is the person in possession or control of the property, or any other person claiming ownership, is able to prove that the property does not represent proceeds of crime, then the interlocutory order may be varied or discharged as appropriate. If, at the end of the period of seven years, the respondent has not been able to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the property does not represent proceeds of crime, then a disposal order under section 4 may be made and the title to the property passes to the State. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 subsequently introduced a new section 4(a), which provides for a consent disposal order. Section 4(a) allows for the seven-year period to be reduced with the consent of all parties involved. The Minister welcomes the debate today while having due regard to the overall context and background to the proceeds of crime legislation. The House will appreciate that traditionally our approach to tackling criminal behaviour is to bring the perpetrators of crime to justice under our criminal law and to allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions and penalties on those convicted of crime. A more recent feature of our approach has been the establishment of well-developed systems for confiscation of the proceeds of crime. It is through divesting those involved in criminal conduct of their illicit gains that we seek to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises and prevent the possible future reuse of illicit funds for criminal purposes. The non-conviction-based model for confiscation of the proceeds of crime, which is the model affected by the proposed Bill, was introduced into the Irish legal system through the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. The proceeds of crime legislation was introduced by the State as a proportional and legitimate response, in the interests of the common good, to the serious organised crime situation that had developed at that time, particularly the growth of organised crime gangs and the emergence of gang leaders and associates who ensured that they remained at a distance from the actual commission of offences, but who had most to gain from those activities. The Minister for Justice and Equality is of the view that it is important to emphasise in this regard that the primary purpose of the proceeds of crime legislation is not to enrich the Exchequer with expropriated property but to freeze proceeds of crime to deprive those concerned of the benefits of criminal proceeds. The provisions of the 1996 Act were considered very novel at the time of their introduction; therefore, particular attention was paid to ensuring that the provisions met with the rigorous standards of the Constitution. It is worth recalling a number of the key concepts and features of the model. While traditional conviction-based models act in personam against a convicted person, the Irish non-conviction based model acts in rem on the property that constitutes the proceeds of crime. It applies civil law rather than criminal law concepts. Therefore, with regard to matters of evidence, it is the civil law standard that applies - that is, on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. The regime provided by the proceeds of crime legislation is not considered punitive or criminal in nature. The respondent is not necessarily suspected of the crime from which the proceeds have derived, and the State does not need to show a link between the person in whose possession the assets are seized and the crime. The effect of the order is solely to deprive the holder of the beneficial enjoyment of the property in question. In considering the legislative model, it is important to note that the legislation provides for a number of very important safeguards such as notice provisions, the opportunity for a respondent to seek to vary an order, the opportunity for any persons claiming ownership to be heard, provision for legal aid, provision for compensation, etc. These safeguards are vital in ensuring that the system is fair and that the model is not unduly oppressive in effect. It is also worth recalling that since its introduction, the proceeds of crime legislation has been the subject of a number of challenges with regard to the question of whether it meets the standards of fundamental rights and protections enshrined in the Constitution of Ireland and the European Convention on Human Rights.There has been good reason for approaching with caution the seven-year timeframe other than on the basis of consent to disposal. Principal concerns in this regard relate to the potential for any reduction in the statutory timeframe to give succour to an argument that the legislative scheme set out in the Proceeds of Crime Acts is penal or criminal in nature and-or that the scheme does not take due account of potential third party interests. The most constant criticism of the legislation since its introduction has been that it penalises individuals without the individual affected being convicted of an offence or that it is penal in nature. A reduction of the period between the interlocutory order and the disposal order might render the legislation more open to challenge on the grounds that it is a penal confiscation without due process. The shorter the period before the forfeiture stage, the greater the chance that the forfeiture might be deemed penal. Also, while a period of seven years does not overcome all the relevant periods under the Statute of Limitations, it addresses the majority of them. The period of seven years was therefore carefully selected at the time as a desirable time span during which contractual claims could be defeated. It is also significant that the current seven year statutory period fits within a scheme of protections for the person from whom assets are taken, and for third parties. Therefore it is important that consideration of any amending proposal take place within the context of a comprehensive review which would take into account whether, for example, these protections need to be adjusted. It is important that any changes to the statutory timeframe of seven years are not made in isolation which may have the effect of upsetting the overall legislative framework. Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the Minister, while sympathetic to the thinking behind Deputy Maloney's proposal, fears it is incomplete in that it only deals with the narrow issue of the statutory timeframe, outside of a comprehensive review of the legislation which would have regard to the totality of the legislative scheme. An expert group established under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality has been engaged in a comprehensive review of the proceeds of crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau. A number of matters are being reviewed by the group, including decreasing the amount of time which must elapse before criminal assets which have been frozen become the property of the State. When the work of the expert group concludes proposals will in due course be brought forward for inclusion in the proceeds of crime (amendment) Bill which is included in the Government's legislative programme. The Minister has asked me to assure the House that Deputy Maloney's proposal will be considered in the context of the overall review of the proceeds of crime legislation which is under way and any emerging proposals will be contained in the proposed proceeds of crime (amendment) Bill. I thank Deputy Maloney again for introducing the Bill. While there is agreement that the matter raised merits consideration it would be wise for such consideration to take place within a broader review of the legislation.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Deputy Maloney will appreciate my earlier point about the Government’s ongoing review of this area and that it does not intend to oppose the Bill. I commend the Deputy for introducing this Bill. It is typical of the work he has done in this House, focusing attention on issues of this nature. He has been working diligently in this area for many years, even before he was elected to this House. I read an article today in the Irish Examiner about a man called Vincent O'Brien. It stated: "Cork city coroner Myra Cullinane was told yesterday that a spoon, a dirty needle, and other drug paraphernalia were found next to Vincent O’Brien’s unconscious body in a toilet cubicle in Dunnes Stores on North Main Street, Cork, on 2 December." That is the reality of drug crime. There are very few crimes and little criminal activity that are not related in some way to the drug situation and the demand for drugs. Prostitution was mentioned earlier. I am quite sure if one goes down to low-level crime - if it can be termed that - such as burglaries, robberies and muggings, one will find they are connected in some way with the drug situation. If any citizen feels they can engage in drug-taking at a recreational level, be they middle class, students or whatever, and not think they have fuelled a gang, as well as a situation that resulted in the death of somebody like Vincent O'Brien, then they are deluding themselves. The gangs that reap windfalls of money as a result depend on middle class drug-takers to fuel what they do. Drugs are in every city, town and village. Middle class people have a better way of hiding it while working class communities are generally devastated by it. We all have a collective responsibility for the deaths of people like Vincent O'Brien, as well as for the children born with drug dependency and for the young people who find themselves imprisoned for long stretches or dead as a result of their involvement in the drugs trade. I have seen where young people, who feel locked out of the mainstream economy and society, find somewhere else to get empowerment. The drugs trade is there willing and able to take them on and give them that sense of empowerment. They find it glamorous, lucrative and empowering. Many of the issues raised today are valid. There is a need to see reinvestment in areas which have been devastated as a result of drugs and from the proceeds from this crime culture and criminal activity. We have much work to do, notwithstanding the Deputy’s legislation and the Government’s ongoing review of this area. This is an issue about which we have to think differently. Generations have been stolen, families have been devastated and people have been afflicted by drugs. It is difficult, trying and monumentally hard to overcome drug addiction. It is difficult to contemplate how hard it is for some addicted to drugs to get clean and on the better path. We have not helped in our public discourse, be it in the political or media sphere. We have denigrated those who have this affliction, calling them names and describing them as a subspecies, and believing it would be better if they were just moved on. Deputy Maloney’s Bill focuses on those at the top of society living the high life from the proceeds of crime. There is much goodwill in this House which will allow us to move on this. The message must go out that if, as private citizens, we think there is no connection between a drag on a joint or a pill taken in a nightclub and the death of someone like Vincent O'Brien, then we are lying to ourselves. We have to constantly and consistently spread that message in society because Vincent O'Brien's death is the fault of each and every one of us. We must take it on the chin and take responsibility for it to ensure we do not have another case like it. If Deputy Maloney's legislation can bring us some somewhere along the way, then it will be considered in the wider review the Government is undertaking.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That Report Stage be taken now."
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to take Report Stage of this important Bill on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets that she cannot be here because she has to attend the Cabinet meeting which is currently taking place. I propose to deal with the amendments tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace together as they all relate to the offence of "public provocation to commit a terrorist offence". The amendments seek to either remove the offence of "public provocation" or revise the wording of the definition of the offence. I will deal first with the proposal to completely remove the offence of "public provocation" from the Bill which would be the effect of amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and 7 which propose to delete references to the offence where it occurs in sections 3, 4 and 7. The offence of "public provocation" is one of three new offences that the Bill is required to provide for to allow Ireland to transpose EU Council Framework Decision 2008/919/JHA on combating terrorism and facilitate ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism which has already been signed by Ireland. The offence of "public provocation" is a central element of the framework decision and the convention, both of which were agreed to by member states of the European Union and member countries of the Council of Europe, including Ireland. To exclude this offence, as proposed by the Deputies, would mean that we would not be in a position to fulfil our obligation to transpose the Council framework decision or ratify the Council of Europe convention which is, after all, the main purpose of the legislation. The Minister for Justice and Equality considers it appropriate that the offence of "public provocation" be covered in Irish law as it is, undoubtedly, an offence to incite a person to commit terrorist activity. Public provocation or incitement is clearly a preparatory terrorist activity and should be strongly discouraged and suitably punished. Specifically and in relation to amendment No. 7, it is not certain that the Deputies' amendments would achieve the desired result. Section 7 of the Bill amends section 6 of the principal Act, the Terrorist Offences Act 2005, and provides that it will be an offence to attempt to commit the offence of "recruitment for terrorism" and to commit the offence of "training for terrorism" but that it will not be an offence to attempt to commit the offence of "public provocation to commit terrorism". This is in accordance with the provisions of both the Council framework decision and the Council of Europe convention and reflects the fact that the offence of "public provocation", as defined, or elements of it, is more conceptually difficult to "attempt". Furthermore, the notion of intent is already covered in the "public provocation" offence as framed in that the definition of "public provocation" set out in section 4 of the Bill refers to "the intentional distribution, or otherwise making available, by whatever means of communication by a person of a message to the public, with the intent of encouraging, directly or indirectly, the commission by a person of a terrorist activity". The effect of the proposed amendment to section 7 would be to also make it an offence to "attempt" to commit the offence of "public provocation". It is unsure that this is what the Deputies intended, as it is clear from a number of the other amendments put forward that the overall intention is to remove the offence of "public provocation" from the Bill. Therefore, for the reasons outlined, it is not proposed to accept the Deputies' amendments to delete references to the offence of "public provocation" from the Bill. I now turn to amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, which seek to revise the wording of the definition of "public provocation to commit a terrorist offence" in section 4 of the Bill. The amendments put forward by both Deputies are similar in nature and would essentially have the effect of narrowing the scope of the definition of "public provocation". It would do this in amendments Nos. 4 and 6 by removing the notion of indirectly encouraging the commission of a terrorist activity and replacing the word "encouraging" with the word "inciting" instead. It should, first, be pointed out that the wording of the definition of the "public provocation" offence, as with the two other offences, is based on advice received from the Office of the Attorney General and drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The wording, as drafted, broadly reflects the definition of "public provocation to commit a terrorist offence" as set out in the amending Council framework decision on combating terrorism and the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, the international instruments to which the Bill seeks to give effect. In order to enable Ireland to correctly transpose and ratify these instruments, the wording of our definition must capture the various elements of the offences as framed in these international instruments which are included in Schedules to the Bill. It is clear from the definitions provided in both instruments which are broadly similar that the indirect, as well as the direct, advocation of terrorist offences is intended to be covered by the offence of "public provocation". The definition, as provided for in the Bill and the international legal instruments, contains the word "intent", which implies that intention should be present, whether the commission of a terrorist offence is advocated directly or indirectly. I turn briefly to the proposal to replace the word "encouraging" with "inciting" in amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive. This is a common element in each of the amendments. While the definitions in the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe convention contain the word "incite", the Office of the Attorney General advised against using the term "incitement", a common law offence, when defining the offence of "public provocation to commit a terrorist offence". Concern was expressed by the office that the word "incitement", as understood in Irish law, might not capture circumstances where there had been no direct advocation and could, therefore, lead to difficulties in the prosecution of such cases. As I mentioned, the definition of "public provocation", as framed in both the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe convention, requires that indirect advocation of the commission of a terrorist offence must be covered. The wording of the definition of "public provocation" in the Bill should, therefore, remain as drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the basis of the legal advice received on the matter. This is also in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on inchoate offences, 2010, as to the terminology to be used when defining an act of incitement in statute in order to properly reflect the expansiveness of the meaning of the term "incitement" in common law. Again, for the reasons outlined, it is not proposed to accept the Deputies' amendments in this regard.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy McGrath for giving me the opportunity to address the issues associated with the Bill he has published. The provision of sustainable water services is of critical importance to citizens and the economy of our country. As Members will be aware, modernising and improving water services delivery in Ireland is a key policy objective in the programme for Government. The establishment of Irish Water has been one of the most significant elements among a wide range of public sector reform measures achieved by the Government. The move towards the utility model will deliver major benefits to our people and to our economy in a number of ways, notably through providing a more structured and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of water services on a national basis; achieving economies of scale in service delivery and more efficient procurement of materials and services; reducing unacceptable levels of waste from the drinking water distribution system with an estimated 40% of treated drinking water being unaccounted for prior to the establishment of Irish Water; and reducing the overall costs of delivering water services. The establishment of Irish Water within Bord Gáis Éireann, which has now been renamed Ervia, was an important step in assisting the utility to leverage the existing core expertise available to Bord Gáis as a modern and efficiently run utility. Ervia and Irish Water estimate that establishing Irish Water within the BGE group has saved potentially tens of millions of euro. In the longer term, the establishment of Irish Water will lead to a more efficient service due to economies of scale, and to a higher quality and more resilient service due to increased capacity to invest and innovate. The reform of water services is not only important to delivering better value for money to our citizens but is also critical to supporting economic development and growth. By 2030, the world is expected to need 40% more water than will be available. We are distinct from most countries due to the level of fresh water available, a benefit we can turn to our advantage by creating a world class water sector that can attract water-intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agrifood to Ireland. These industries already sustain well over 200,000 jobs between them. This Bill aims to amend the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to provide for the following: Irish Water to be subject to freedom of information legislation; creating a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water; ensuring that Irish Water will not be transferred to private ownership or public private partnership without such ownership or partnership being put before the people via referendum; and requiring that the Minister direct Irish Water, within two years of its establishment, to provide for the provision of an insurance policy to all of its customers with respect to water leakage and damaged infrastructure. A number of the proposals in this Bill have already been comprehensively dealt with through legislation introduced by the Government. First, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, included Irish Water under FOI legislation. The Water Services Act 2014 then included the requirement that any proposal to change the ownership status of Irish Water would first be put to the people. Protecting the interest of customers of Irish Water has been a high priority for the Government throughout the water reform process. To ensure this protection, the 2014 Act provided that the Commission for Energy Regulation, which had previously been assigned the function for water regulation, was required to establish a dispute resolution process for Irish Water customers. I will now deal with the specific proposals contained in the Bill. Irish Water is already subject to FOI legislation. Under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2014, Irish Water has been subject to the provisions of the FOI Acts from 17 July 2013. In regard to the independent ombudsman for water, it was a policy decision of the Government to establish Irish Water as a public utility, and this is reflected in the legislation passed by the Oireachtas. The legislative framework the Government has put in place to establish Irish Water and the CER, as the economic regulator for Irish Water, means there is a robust process for the protection of customer interests and clearly demonstrates that the customer was at the centre of Government's thinking when framing the legislation. As can be seen from the extensive activity being undertaken by the CER, this process is operating effectively. In addition, the CER has been given a specific statutory role under the Water Services Act 2014 in regard to dispute resolution for Irish Water customers. This will involve a similar service to that operated by the CER for the gas and electricity sectors, whereby it can investigate customer complaints that Irish Water has not resolved. I do not believe the creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water, as suggested in this Bill, is therefore warranted. Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has also required Irish Water to submit a customer handbook outlining the minimum customer service standards it will provide to its customers. The customer handbook comprises Irish Water's customer charter, codes of practice and terms and conditions of supply. Along with these measures, the CER will engage with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query. In this regard, it should be noted that Irish Water is also subject to statutory supervision by the EPA and the Health Service Executive in respect of any environmental and human health aspects of its water services provision. In regard to the ownership of Irish Water, it has been made very clear that the Government is totally opposed to the privatisation of public water services and there is no question of the service being privatised. The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann, conforming to the conditions contained in the Act and registered under the Companies Act. The Act provides that Irish Water is registered as a private company limited by shares under the Companies Act, with one share in Irish Water issued to Bord Gáis Éireann, now Ervia, and the remaining shares allocated equally between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance. As Ervia is a fully State-owned company, Irish Water is, accordingly, in full State ownership. Subsequently, an amendment introduced in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 prohibits each of the three shareholders from disposing of their shareholding in Irish Water and thus places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water. To copperfasten this prohibition, the Water Services Act 2014 provides that any proposal by a future Government for legislation that would involve any change in the State's ownership of Irish Water, as outlined, would require approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently any proposal would have to be put to the people via a plebiscite before such legislation could even proceed. Also, there is a further statutory provision which safeguards water services infrastructure in public ownership. Section 31(12) of the Water Services Act 2007 prevents Irish Water from entering into any agreement or arrangement with another person which involves or may involve the transfer of assets and infrastructure from Irish Water to that person. In regard to an insurance policy for customers, it is not the function of Irish Water to provide any type of insurance policy for customers in terms of leaks or damaged infrastructure. Under the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. This is similar to the situation with other utility services, such as gas or electricity. The proposal in the Bill to change responsibility for internal repairs and maintenance would have significant implications from a financial perspective for Irish Water and could have wide-ranging impacts for other utility service providers. I do not believe, therefore, that the proposal in the Bill is an appropriate approach to take on this issue. This morning's debate provides an important opportunity to remind the House of the significant progress that has been made in implementing the Government's water sector reform programme. This programme is based on three pillars: the establishment of a national utility to provide water and waste water services on a national basis; the establishment of a sustainable funding model for water services, underpinned by domestic and non-domestic water charges and the ability of the national utility to borrow from capital markets to increase infrastructural spending, and to increase annual expenditure from approximately €300 million per annum when Irish Water was established to at least €600 million per annum; and the introduction of independent economic regulation of Irish Water, which has been assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation. With each new challenge in our public water system that Irish Water confronts, the underlying need for reform becomes increasingly clear and justification for reform becomes stronger. Public water services were and remain in need of change in the way they are delivered, as does the way they are funded. The previous system of providing water services through local authorities was not working properly, despite the best efforts of the dedicated and experienced staff involved. Local authorities were restricted in their ability to borrow, so they could not invest adequately in the system. The time taken to make decisions to invest was often slow, bureaucratic and inefficient. Planning for new water services largely stopped at the county boundary, so there was limited opportunity to achieve economies of scale on a regional or national basis. We saw and continue to see the results of this fundamentally flawed approach in almost every city, town and county. There are major issues around the quality of water supply and the capacity of the existing system to supply treated water in the quantities needed by households, business and industry. For example, there are almost 20,123 people on boil water notices from 21 supplies, and more than 955,000 people depend on drinking water supplies that are at risk of failing the required standards. Almost half the water treated, at significant cost, escapes through leaks and is unaccounted for. For example, Irish Water was able to establish that 22 households were leaking over 1 million litres a day into their driveways. That is enough to serve the daily needs of the town of Gorey. There are 44 towns where largely untreated sewage is running into our rivers and seas, including popular seaside towns such as Cobh, Youghal and Bundoran. This cannot be allowed to continue or it will be hugely damaging to our vital tourism sector. In Dublin, more than 800 km of piping is over 100 years old. There is an insufficient water supply for the greater Dublin area. Earlier this year, Irish Water published a project need report, which identified that projected demand for water in Dublin alone is expected to increase by over 50% by 2050. This is far beyond the capacity of the existing sources which serve the region. Nationally, our population is increasing, our economy is growing and our climate is changing. These realities bring new demands and challenges for our water system, the reality that a single national utility is best equipped to manage. By 2030, our river basin management plans will have been reviewed a further three times and the quality of our water bodies will have to be improved. Our rivers, lakes and other water bodies need greater protection, not just for the protection of public health and our natural environment, but to ensure that our thriving tourism industry can continue to prosper under the banner of Ireland's image as a clean, green country. The three pillars of reform - a national utility, a new sustainable finding model and the introduction of independent economic regulation - have been implemented and are leading to major changes in how we plan and deliver water infrastructure and services. Irish Water has introduced fundamental reforms to the planning and delivery of water services. It has adopted a new approach to asset management, for example, which has resulted in a significant change of approach to infrastructural delivery. Central strategic planning is now based on accurate asset performance data and full control of all investment decisions. The utility is now planning investment consistently across the asset base rather than large-scale, one-off investments. An example of this is the proposed Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade, where an alternative approach to a treatment plant extension will save the company €170 million in capital investment. The utility has also standardised certain operational procedures, leading to benefits in performance and energy costs. It is conducting plant and process audits, which are identifying repair needs, assisting in planned maintenance programmes and providing for efficiency scoping. It has introduced utility systems to manage spend, improve value for money and capture the condition and performance of water services infrastructure. Under the service level agreements, annual plans and the 2014-2017 transformation plan, Irish Water has begun implementing other initiatives that will standardise and modernise operations, asset management, customer service, procurement improvement, and assets data intelligence. Examples of this are the hand-held devices that council staff will be given so that they can be given work orders quickly to fix water problems and report back when they are completed, and the single national laboratory service for testing water samples. The greater economies of scale which are possible through having one national utility rather than 31 separate local authorities have resulted in €12 million in procurement savings in the company's first year alone.In the area of electricity supply, a major cost in the production of water, Irish Water's current renewable and efficient energy initiatives aim to reduce costs by 33% by 2020. In April 2014, Irish Water became the main contact point for customer queries and reports regarding water supply outages and water quality through its customer call centre.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This development was another milestone along the road to achieving a single, standardised national service throughout the country, with a greater focus on those who use the public services. Such progress would not have been possible without strong co-operation between Irish Water and local authorities, which have decades of experience of providing water and wastewater services with great care and dedication. The 12 year service level agreements, now almost a year in existence, have proven to be a strong partnership between the local authorities' expertise in operations and the considerable network and utility management experience within the Ervia Group. This was most evident during Storm Darwin in February last year, when the two parties collaborated effectively to address emergency situations and maintain clear lines of communication with each other and with the public during a time of pressure on the public water system. The scale of the roll-out of the metering programme has been particularly impressive. By any measurement, the domestic metering programme has been a success. Unparalleled anywhere in scale or ambition, Irish Water has installed almost 700,000 meters in just over 21 months.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The utility surpassed its end of year target in 2014 six weeks ahead of schedule, and is delivering a programme that is sustaining approximately 1,050 jobs throughout the country, providing the kind of economic stimulus we need. Some 80% of these jobs are held by people in one of three social inclusion categories, namely, the unemployed, employees of small and medium enterprises, or graduates-school leavers-apprentices. This far exceeds the Government's original target of 25%. As well as facilitating usage-based charging, which international evidence shows can reduce domestic consumption by up to 10%, the metering programme is detecting customer side leakage. Irish Water estimates that about 6% of all water produced is lost through customer side leakage. The presence of meters is helping Irish Water identify leakage that is now being fixed through the interim first fix free scheme. The interim phase of this scheme covers leaks from the boundary of the property to a point as close as possible to the dwelling, but will not include leaks internal to the dwelling or other buildings on the property. This involves identifying customer side leakage between the meter box and the point of entry into the house, offering repairs of these leaks to customers. The utility has offered over 2,500 customers leak investigations under the interim scheme, and plans on issuing 7,500 notifications regarding larger leaks, with notifications prioritised in order of size of leak to maximise potential water savings. It plans to conduct the associated leak investigations and qualifying repairs.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I too welcome the students in the Visitors Gallery, including the teachers, some of whom I recognise. I thank all Members who have contributed to this debate. As I outlined earlier, the Government cannot support the Bill tabled by Deputy McGrath. Although I appreciate the sentiment behind the Bill, as I have already stated, the legislative and policy framework put in place by this Government, in particular the Water Services Act 2014, provides for what is proposed in the Bill.The Government is in favour of measures that lead to increased transparency in relation to public administration generally and as such Irish Water has been subject to freedom of information legislation since 17 July 2013. The Commission for Energy Regulation has been given the role of independent economic regulator for Irish Water and its primary statutory purpose is to ensure the protection of customers' interests. This role is underpinned in statute. Section 39(1) of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that the commission shall perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water. The CER has also been assigned a specific statutory role under the Water Services Act 2014 in respect of resolving disputes that may arise between Irish Water and its customers. This will involve a similar service to that operated by the Commission for Energy Regulation for the gas and electricity sectors, with the CER investigating customer complaints which Irish Water has not resolved. The creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water, as suggested in this Bill, is, therefore, a duplication of effort and expense. Reference was made to the suggestion that the establishment of Irish Water could be a precursor to privatisation. This issue has been raised before and it has been shown to be without foundation. The Government has made it clear that Irish Water will remain in public ownership. In fact, this is laid down in statute in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and the Water Services Act 2014. Any change in the State's ownership of Irish Water would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and, subsequently, any proposal would have to be put to the people via a plebiscite before it could proceed. A final proposal relating to insurance is contained in this Bill. Irish Water is not statutorily required to provide any type of insurance policy for customers in terms of leaks or damaged infrastructure. Responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner, as set out in the Water Services Act 2007. This approach is similar to the position in respect of other utility services such as gas or electricity. Changing the legal responsibility for internal repairs and maintenance would have significant implications from a financial perspective for Irish Water and could have wide-ranging impacts for other utility service providers. Therefore, I cannot agree with the proposal on this issue. The Government is confident that the strategic national approach Irish Water has taken to all aspects of water services provision in Ireland will deliver benefits for the customer. It is evident that Irish Water has many challenges to confront and resolve. This will be done with the aim of providing a world-class service to the customer and this remains at the centre of the Government's reform programme. As has been clearly outlined today, the Government has already put in place the measures required to address the objectives of this Bill in a comprehensive manner. On that basis the Government is opposing the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the report by the joint committee. Although important in itself, this will aid in the decision process to be engaged in by Government in the context of recommendations to be made in the forthcoming report of independent working group on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. I understand that report will be presented to Government this month. I thank Members of the joint committee for their diligence in going about their business in relation to this topic, in respect of which, as this House knows, I have had a long-standing interest. Quite properly, members made on the ground visits to four direct provision centres in Galway, Limerick, Meath and Dublin, and these were a cross section of the 34 asylum accommodation centres across the State in which 4,500 persons currently reside. The Deputy is correct in saying that approximately one third of those are children and approximately one third of those have been in the system for more than five years. Since my appointment as Minister of State last year, I too have visited centres in Waterford, Dublin, Sligo, Laois, Mosney, Galway, Limerick and Clare to see for myself the conditions in which these residents live. The dry facts set out in official documents and reports cannot properly convey the day-to-day realities which they face, which mostly revolve around waiting and hoping. None the less, I am glad the report also acknowledges that many owners, management and staff seek to alleviate the consequences of the direct provision system. I also appreciate that the committee held two hearings on this matter, the first on 22 October 2014 involving asylum seekers and NGOs and the second on 1 April 2015 which I and two officials from the Department of Justice and Equality attended. At my appearance on 1 April, I made my own views on this subject clear to the committee. I cannot and will not stand over the system of direct provision.  In its report, the committee focuses on recommendations which fall within its remit but also makes recommendations on various aspects of the direct provision system for consideration by other relevant sectoral Oireachtas committees. I think this unusual approach is inevitable given the quite broad nature of the State's responsibilities in the area of international protection.While my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I fully support the independent working group under the chairmanship of a former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, we do not know what recommendations will be made in its pending report. Equally, we have not sought to influence its conclusions. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume the report will address many of the issues raised in the joint committee's report. I understand the working group's report will amalgamate reports from three smaller and more focused subgroups dealing with specific themes: conditions in centres, supports for asylum seekers, and improvements in the processing of protection claims. While I do not wish to anticipate the working group report, which is due to be presented to the Government this month, I will address the four recommendations in its report that the joint committee considers to be within its remit: that a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints system be provided for residents under the house rules of the direct provision centre; that the legal remit for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman or Children be extended to include the direct provision system, as well as the administration of law relating to immigration and naturalisation; that responsibility for centre inspections be given to an independent body, such as HIQA; and that the Freedom of Information Acts be extended to cover the direct provision system, as well as the administration of the law relating to immigration and naturalisation. The issue that is the subject of the first recommendation - the apparent need for a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints mechanism - came to the fore in the judgment issued by the High Court in November 2014 in the CA and TA case. Although the High Court found that the direct provision system did not breach human rights, it did find that certain aspects of the house rules dealing with guests, signing in and the lack of an independent appeals mechanism were unlawful. Although the issue was discussed at the working group, I understand it will not form part of its recommendations. Nevertheless, revised house rules which address the court's findings have been issued in the meantime. The rules now provide for the option of a final appeal to an independent complaints officer. I should record here that the judgment in the CA and TA case is under appeal. The second recommendation concerns the extension of the legal remit for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include the direct provision system and the administration of law relating to immigration and naturalisation. As things stand, this is a matter of legislation which falls within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Section 5(1)(e) of the Ombudsman Act 1980 and section 11(1)(e) of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 provide that neither ombudsman shall investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum. This has been interpreted to include the direct provision system. I note that the view of the current Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, as expressed to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on 11 March 2015, is that decisions on matters other than immigration status, including decisions on issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaints processes, are in his remit. The first point to be made on this recommendation is that it is not intended under any circumstances that either ombudsman will serve as a first instance appellant authority in relation to day-to-day administrative complaints mechanisms. It is a requirement that a person who wishes to appeal to the Ombudsman must first try to solve the problem with the public body concerned using a formal local appeals mechanism. I have already referred to the changes in the house rules providing for a final independent complaints mechanism, even if that falls short of recourse to the Ombudsman. The current administrative processes which lead to decisions on asylum claims are substantially set out in legislation. First instance protection decisions are made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and are subject to appeals before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Both offices are legally independent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and their decisions can be judicially reviewed by the courts. The Government would have to consider carefully how the addition of another independent body into this process would affect a system that is already complicated. Pending consideration by the Government of the report of the independent working party, there are no plans to change those legislative provisions to give either office the power to investigate asylum-related matters. With regard to the second recommendation, and on the issue of processing, I point out that earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, published the general scheme of an international protection Bill, the aim of which is to reduce waiting times for asylum applicants. The key provision of the Bill will be to replace the existing multilayered protection determination system with a single procedure, the aim of which will be to enable timely and efficient protection decisions. This single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage people who have no entitlement to stay in the State and can safely return to their country of origin. Further on this specific recommendation, notwithstanding the legal situation, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, have administrative arrangements in place with both ombudsman offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to their attention. I will now turn to the third recommendation, which is that responsibility for centre inspections should be given to an independent body such as HIQA. While it is understandable that HIQA is cited as an example of an independent inspection body, it is not the only one. Moreover, its remit is strictly covered in legislation. It is important to point out that RIA, which is the unit in the Department of Justice and Equality responsible for the administration of the direct provision system, already engages an independent private body to carry out inspections of its centres. All centres are subject to a minimum of three unannounced inspections a year. One inspection is carried out by QTS, which is an independent company under contract to RIA, and the other two are carried out by RIA officials. All completed inspections are published on RIA's website and this adds to the transparency of the system. Researchers, Deputies, residents of centres, NGO officials and everyone else can examine these reports in detail. It has to be said that asylum accommodation centres do not exist in isolation. They are subject to RIA inspections and other State inspections. They are, for example, subject to inspection by fire officers and, in relation to food issues, to unannounced inspections by environmental health officers. This is not to say that the inspection regime cannot be improved, as it can. I await the working group findings in this regard. The fourth recommendation relates to the freedom of information regime, which has long applied to INIS and RIA. By virtue of the Freedom of Information Act 2014, it has been extended to Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with effect from 14 April last. The usual provisions and exemptions of the Freedom of Information Acts apply in relation to commercially sensitive matters. There are no special provisions relating to immigration-related matters. In order to be as transparent as possible, RIA currently makes available on request contract details for all contracts to the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously. For example, at the end of January 2015, the records were updated to the end of December 2012. These records provide a context for the moneys paid for each contract, such as the length of the contract and the number of people for which services are contracted. I believe the joint committee has performed a very useful public service with its report. That report, along with the report of the working group, will fully inform the Government in the decisions it will have to make in reforming a system which has been the subject of much-deserved criticism. I look forward to listening to this afternoon's Dáil debate on the report.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputies for their contributions. As I said previously, this is one of the issues that goes beyond politics in this House. I have been impressed by the level of interest that Deputies and Senators from different parties have taken in this discussion on this area of direct provision. However, references to welfare fraud do not help when we are discussing the issue of direct provision in this country. We have had a love affair with incarcerating people. We did it in mental institutions in the 1950s. We did it in the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools, and we continue to do it with the direct provision system. I know Department officials do not like those comparisons, and they know that when the original decision was made to establish direct provision centres - there were 60 initially and now there are only 34 - it was in response to a particular situation. The amount of time that it was envisaged somebody would stay in a direct provision centre was six months and now people have been living there for more than ten years, and there are children who know nothing else but a direct provision centre. That has belittled them and stripped them of their dignity. I am very taken by the human stories that, individually and collectively, we have come across in direct provision centres. One man in Limerick has been completely broken by what we have done to him. Obviously, his circumstances in the country where he came from resulted in him being very vulnerable but we have compounded that and broken him. I feel a great sense of duty to that individual, and to the other 4,500 people who are living in the system, one third of whom are children and one third of whom have been living there for over five years. I would stay in some of the centres but I would not spend a night in some of the others. I recall seeing in one centre a corridor of eight sleeping units separated by curtains. I would not stay in it, and I would not expect anybody else to stay in it either. While every other country in Europe seems to be strangled with the conversation around immigration and xenophobia, this House and this country can be proud of the fact that we have not allowed the issue of asylum, immigration or integration strangle our political debate, and it does not come to the forefront of election discussions. However, I am awaiting the publication of the report. Decent, honourable people who are as critical of the direct provision system as anybody could sit on that working group. The reason for its establishment was to assemble the people who know the system best as well as officials who are overseeing the system and officials from different Departments who need to be discussing issues with them such as education, the environment and social protection, and allow them come to conclusions. On one particular issue I am led to believe that 15 individual meetings took place. That is why, when I was expecting originally that we could assemble the group in September and have a report by Christmas, it has proved almost impossible to do it in that timeframe. While I was hoping to get the report last month, it now appears it will be ready this month but if we want to do something, we have to do it well. It would be my intention, and I am sure the intention of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on receipt of the report to bring it to the Government first, publish it and then implement it because all the hard work has been done. All the convincing of officials has been done and as Deputy Murphy rightly said, it is now the responsibility of the Government to implement it during this term. In this post-referendum era when we are all talking about equality, there are other groups in society who want to know what this new feeling of equality will give to them. They are members of the Traveller community, people who live in socially and economically deprived areas, young people, old people, people new to our country, and certainly people living in direct provision centres. While my individual responses to the report may have left some Deputies less than inspired, and I appreciate Deputy Mac Lochlainn's endeavours in this regard which reflect very well on his chairmanship of the committee and the members also as this is an issue they have taken on and feel so strongly about, when the report is published and people see what it contains we can finally turn the page on what has been a shameful period in Irish history that we cannot defend. On the day I became Minister of State with responsibility for new communities in the Department of Justice and Equality I said this was not a system I could stand over. It is a system that belittles and dehumanises people. We cannot stand over a system where people are languishing for years, with a sense of having no future. A number of things have to happen. What kind of system could I oversee? What kind of system could we stand over? It was initially envisaged that direct provision would be a system to tackle the homelessness crisis. I can envisage a system where there is an excellently run centre, with proper oversight, links to the community and proper cooking facilities for families. It can be suggested by people who do not understand the importance of proper cooking facilities that they are unimportant but they are very important to a mother and father who need to prepare food for their children. We need proper family orientated dwellings. We must do away with the idea, which I have seen in some centres, of a wardrobe in a single room separating the children's and the parents' sleeping conditions. That is outrageous. We must do away with that and have proper family living facilities but we must only ever envisage that somebody would be there for a matter of weeks or months, and certainly not more than six months and certainly not for a period of years. The asylum system should treat these people with respect and dignity and we should not have a situation where people are languishing in it for years. It is the responsibility of Deputies in this House to make contributions to this debate, not to respond to uninformed, ill-judged, unresearched comments from constituents. They should base all their comments regarding the asylum system or integration issues on facts. That is very important when we are dealing with people who are vulnerable. We have a fantastic opportunity now, in this post-referendum era and as we face into the commemoration of the 1916 Rising, to reassess our values as a Republic, and this is one of the areas which has been a stain on our reputation over the past number of years. When the report comes to Government, and I have been told it will be this month, although I was expecting it next week - there may be a slight delay on that - the responsibility then is not just to publish but to implement. If people such as representatives from the UNHCR, SPIRASI, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Jesuit refugee group, as well as representatives from academia and people with a history in the trade union movement, have taken the time, under the stewardship of Bryan McMahon, to come up with a report over this number of months, and they see it is workable, it is then the responsibility of Government to act and to ensure it is implemented in a timely fashion. Regardless of how humane our system of direct provision is here, nobody wants to live in these centres. They want to live a full and productive life, and we must be conscious of that. Currently within the system there are 500 people who have leave to remain and do not need to be in direct provision, but we have an issue in terms of housing. We have 500 individuals who have been granted permission to start a life in Ireland but they do not have the facilities to do so because of a housing issue and other supports they believe are necessary to transition. That transitional period will be key to how we facilitate people to move out of direct provision and remain connected with the community in which they have been living for some time and where their children may be in school. Helping them to integrate into that community and society and having supports available for them so that they can make that transition will be key as well. Regarding issues to do with education, young people in primary and secondary education can, as the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has already indicated, move on to third level. I do not accept the argument that asylum seekers should not be afforded the right to work. My personal opinion is that we are standing outside the European norm when it comes to facilitating asylum seekers with the right to work. That will remain an issue of contention and debate but the manner in which we have conducted this debate is a credit to this House, the political parties who serve in it, the Seanad and the committees which have raised this as an issue that we should pursue and correct.Rather than taking credit in this House for the way the debate has been conducted, the greatest credit we will get is for implementing the report that will be given to the Government in the next few days. We can then finally put to bed the scandal of direct provision. Hopefully, those within the system can see a brighter future and we can have a system of which we can be rightly proud in a country that calls itself a republic.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputies Coppinger, Higgins and Murphy for bringing this Private Members' Bill before the House. Deputies will be well aware of my strong convictions on the need to amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. I entirely agree with the Deputies proposing the legislation that it is wrong to discriminate or exclude people from employment or to deny them services under the nine grounds of the equality legislation. It is our collective belief across this House and society that one's gender, sexual orientation, civil status, religion, age, disability, ethnicity or membership of the Traveller community should never be used to discriminate or exclude. It is for that very reason that I was one of the proposers of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2013, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Seanad. I proposed it with my colleagues Senator Bacik and Deputies Lyons, Hannigan and Conway. Since my appointment as a Minister of State, I have met union representatives, including the INTO LGBT group, on a number of occasions to discuss this topic with them. I was involved in the launch of the “Teachers for Yes” campaign earlier this year in addition to speaking at the INTO LGBT group’s annual conference. I have heard at first hand the group’s stories about teachers who are afraid to be themselves in their workplace. This is not acceptable. These are the people who train our young people, teach them how to read and write and give so much to our society. Divorcees, cohabiting couples and unmarried parents experience the same chill factor. They all deserve to have the right to be themselves in their place of work. The existing section 37(1) of Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that a religious, educational or medical institution that is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment that promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person if it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or prospective employee where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or it takes action that is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. The provision was previously contained in the Employment Equality Bill 1996, which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held that Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance that better meets the rights of employees, the Supreme Court decision outlines the need for balance to be struck; it is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. While the provision was found in 1997 to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of employees, on the one hand, and freedom of religion, on the other, there is legitimate concern that, in practice, it has not worked. Primarily, its operation is regarded as having a particularly chilling effect on LGBT people in the educational system; however, it also affects lone parents and divorcees who are restricted in discussing their private lives with their colleagues in the safety of their staff room. It should be noted that many countries provide for an equivalent of section 37 in their statute book. The main difference is that most countries do not have the vast majority of their schools and hospitals under religious patronage. During my numerous meeting with the INTO LGBT group, I have heard stories of teachers who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender experiencing feelings of isolation and disempowerment in their work. They feel constrained in what they can disclose about their personal lives to their colleagues fearing that this will affect their career or even their daily experience of work in the school. Some even fear the prejudices of parents and students. I have always believed that it is a sad reflection of our equality law that it could be used to make people feel so unequal. For this reason, the Government, in the programme for Government, committed to amending section 37(1) to ensure that its operation leads to a fairer and more equitable balance between the rights of freedom of religion or association, on the one hand, and the right of persons in employment or prospective employees to be free from discrimination and to privacy in their personal lives, on the other. The Government is committed to advancing equality for LGBT people. During our term of office we have introduced the Children and Family Relationships Bill, recognising the different types of families that exist in our State. We held a marriage equality referendum, which both Government parties supported, to ensure that LGBT citizens can get married. We introduced the Gender Recognition Bill to allow people to identify in their chosen gender. We are tackling homophobic bullying in schools. Section 37 is the next step on this journey. On 23 May, there was a collective celebration of joy among LGBT people and their allies as we watched this country enshrine tolerance and love into our Constitution. I was so proud to stand with my LGBT friends and cheer with them as we watched the passage by our people of full marriage equality into our law. I was so proud to be Irish that day as we became the first country in the world to grant full marriage equality by means of a public vote. However, it saddened me that some of the people with whom I was celebrating had to go to work the following Monday and pretend nothing had happened. They could not mention that they had celebrated, nor could they mention the benefit the change in law would have for them. This is why, in one of my first public statements after the referendum, I made clear my intention to continue with the work I started in 2013 and ensure that this section of our law would be amended as soon as possible. One of the stories that has stuck with me since I began my work on this matter concerns the meeting this year between the INTO LGBT group and our President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, at Áras an Uachtaráin. This was to be a day of great celebration and recognition of many years of campaigning work. As the group assembled, its members walked with pride and joy up to the main entrance of the residence. They stood and walked together but, unfortunately, some of them became nervous when a group photograph was suggested. Deeply uncomfortable, at least half a dozen of these teachers stepped to the side, afraid of any consequences that being photographed would have for their career. We live in a republic and, quite simply, this should not happen. The approach of tonight's Bill is somewhat different from that taken in the 2013 Private Members’ Bill in that it proposes removing the right of religious-run educational and medical institutions to take action against an employee who is undermining the institution's ethos. However, I believe the spirit of what we are trying to achieve is much the same, which is why the Government will not be opposing the Bill before us. I have a fear that in tonight's Bill there is a conflict with the constitutional protection for freedom of religion and of religious groups to establish their own institutions of the type at issue here. It is also unclear as to how it would provide any guidance on how to resolve disputes between employees and employers. It would remain the case that an employer has the right to take the action against employees who act against the employer's best interests, and disputes would, following the deletion of the existing provision, fall to be resolved under generally applicable labour relations law. The best course of action is to progress with the 2013 Private Members’ Bill as it insists that employers that are religious institutions providing publicly funded services would have to meet a high standard of justification for any action taken against an employee on grounds of undermining the institution's ethos. This Bill does not distinguish between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes compared with those providing a social, educational or medical service to the public financed by State funding. This is an important distinction that must be provided for in any amending legislation to ensure its constitutionality. The Government has already accepted the principle of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, currently before the Seanad, to amend section 37(1). It will be tabling a number of amendments of its own to improve the Private Members’ Bill when Committee Stage resumes later in the Seanad. The drafting of these amendments is being finalised at present and will be announced as soon as they are received from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and approved by the Government. The intention thereafter is to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible, hopefully by September. The test the Oireachtas must meet when legislating on this matter is to do as the Supreme Court instructed and maintain a proportionate balance between the rights of religious denominations to manage their own affairs and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and the rights of citizens to have full equality before the law and to earn their livelihood. The intentions of the Bill before us are commendable, but we all need to bear in mind very clearly that there is no room for error and that any attempt at reform could be struck down by the courts in the future.This could have a serious adverse impact on precisely the people we are trying to protect. Given the delicate competing rights involved here, it is vital that we carefully consider our approach to reform with the advice of the Attorney General to ensure that it is constitutionally robust and immune from future successful challenge. I can guarantee to everyone in this House that it would be challenged. For that reason, while the Government is not opposing this Bill, we consider that it is better to continue as we are doing which is to advance reform of section 37(1) through amendments to the already mentioned Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that is currently before the Seanad. I hope that the Deputies can understand my reasons for this approach, which are not against the good intentions of the Bill, and accept that the Government is as anxious as any to see this matter addressed as quickly as possible in a way that is constitutionally compliant. So much of my work as Minister of State with responsibility for new communities, culture, equality and drugs strategy is based around the dignity employment brings to an individual or a community. A job brings financial security but it brings a sense of purpose and self-esteem. Traveller groups point to the high level of unemployment in their community as a key issue to be addressed. The comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities which I am currently working on will help those with disabilities into the workplace and protect those workers who acquire a disability. Gender equality in the workplace and introducing progressive family leave legislation is a key commitment for this year. Work is central to our identity as citizens. It is a place where we can grow and contribute. It is where we must be able to be ourselves. There can be no chill factor, which is why we will amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Bill 2014 on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing Criminal Justice Mutual Assistance Act 2008. That Act already gives effect to 12 international agreements which establish the existing legislative framework on the provision of mutual legal assistance. The Bill is necessary to give effect to a further six international agreements not yet provided for in the 2008 Act. I will set out what mutual legal assistance means in practice. In simple terms it enables one state to provide in its own jurisdiction a service to another state related to the administration of justice in the latter. The type of assistance may concern such matters as the investigation of serious international crime, including the gathering of evidence for use abroad or the service of documents issued by a judicial authority. It may also involve freezing or confiscation of proceeds of crime which have been trafficked across international borders. I will now go through the six international agreements to which the Bill gives effect. Council Framework Decision 2005 on mutual recognition of financial penalties establishes the rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a financial penalty order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state. This agreement will allow fines imposed by courts in one member state to be collected in another member state where the person concerned resides or is a citizen. The agreement applies to fines imposed which exceed €70 in respect of any criminal matters, including road traffic offences. It would apply to any fine imposed which is appealable to a criminal court. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of the Council framework decision in accordance with our constitutional requirements on 26 November 2003. Council Framework Decision 2006 on mutual recognition of confiscation orders establishes the rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state. These confiscation orders are used primarily to recover proceeds of crime which have been trafficked from one state to another. They can be used to recover stolen objects or to seize financial criminal assets. We already provide for this type of mutual assistance under a number of existing international instruments such as the 1959 Council of Europe Convention. Ireland receives approximately five or six such requests each year. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of the Council framework decision in accordance with our constitutional requirements on 2 June 2004. Council Decision 2008 on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations aims to improve co-operation between member states' special intervention units in man-made crisis situations that present a serious and direct physical threat, such as terrorist incidents. It should be noted that the framework decision would become relevant only in the event of a very serious terrorist or similar incident. The situation envisaged would involve a large-scale crisis with which a single member state may not have the means, resources or expertise to deal. Assistance could take the form of the provision of equipment or expertise or direct assistance on the territory of the requesting member state. Any visiting specialist units would operate under the responsibility, authority and direction of the requesting member state. In addition, they would be able to operate only within the limits of their own national powers. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Decision on 4 June 2008. Council Decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 refers to the strengthening of Eurojust, an EU agency based in The Hague dealing with judicial co-operation in criminal matters. This Council decision amends the earlier Council Decision 2002/187/JHA setting up Eurojust, and provides for increased co-operation of Eurojust with other agencies such as OLAF or Europol, and strengthens its operational capabilities. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Decision on 26 November 2008. Council Framework Decision 2009 of 26 February 2009 enhancing the procedural rights of persons and fostering the application of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at the trial seeks to ensure adherence to principles of natural justice in cases where judgments in absentia arise in regard to requests for mutual legal assistance. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Framework Decision on 10 December 2008. Council Decision 2010 on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and Japan on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters provides for mutual legal assistance between EU member states and Japan, based on the laws of the requested state. Implementation by Ireland will be based on existing provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008. The Houses of the Oireachtas approved the terms of this Council Decision on 25 November 2009. These international agreements have all been approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas prior to signature by Ireland. For ease of reference, the text of each of these international agreements is being added to the Schedules to the 2008 Act by this Bill. In addition to making the necessary legal provision for these international agreements, the Bill makes a number of minor corrections to existing legislation. The legislation being amended includes the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1998, the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004, the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008. I will now turn to the Bill and explain briefly the elements in it. Sections 1 to 6 of the Bill amend the 2008 Act to provide for the definition of additional EU instruments and related terms required in the Bill. Sections 7 to 23 amend the 2008 Act to give effect to Council Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA. These sections are probably the most technical part of the Bill and it will be helpful to Deputies if I elaborate a
little on the need for these sections and the effect they will have on the legislation. The instrument establishes new rules under which a member state recognises and executes in its territory a confiscation order issued by a court competent in criminal matters of another member state. Under the existing provisions of the 2008 Act, all external confiscation orders must be translated by an Irish court into a domestic confiscation co-operation order. However, under the provisions of this framework decision, courts will in future recognise confiscation orders from member states without the necessity to issue a domestic confiscation co-operation order. This means that effectively we are required to operate two different regimes for dealing with confiscation orders received from other states. Those received from EU states do not require a domestic confiscation co-operation order. Those received from non-EU states will continue to require a domestic co-operation order issued by an Irish court. The next element of the Bill, in section 24, is a new element in mutual assistance legislation to give effect to the Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on mutual recognition of financial penalties. When this part of the Bill is enacted and commenced, the effect will be that fines greater than €70 which are imposed in the State can be collected by another member state if the person concerned is a resident or citizen of that other EU state. Furthermore, penalties imposed in other EU states on persons who are residents or citizens of this State will be collected in this State. The provisions of the Fines (Payment and Recoveries) Act 2014 will apply to such fines. A number of sections make minor technical amendments to the wording of the 2008 Act. Sections 31 and 35
of the Bill give effect to the 2008 Council Decision on enhancing the operation of special intervention units in crisis situations. Deputies will see from the Council Decision text that the type of crisis situations envisaged are situations like major international terrorist incidents which are of a scale which might require a member state to seek assistance from other member states. It should be recognised at the outset that it is considered fairly unlikely that Ireland would experience a crisis situation of the scale that would require this type of assistance. Certainly, an incident of this type and scale has not happened to date in Ireland or in any other EU member state, but in the event that such a major international incident did occur here we would be able to request appropriate assistance from other member states. Deputies will note the express agreement of the Government will be required if as a result of the commission of a criminal offence a crisis situation exists and it is in the public interest to seek the assistance of a special intervention unit from another state. The next element in the Bill I will mention is required to give effect to Council Decision 2009/426/JHA of 16 December 2008 on the strengthening of Eurojust. 
Section 32 of the Bill provides that the Minister may designate a Eurojust national member who may transmit and receive information in accordance with Council Decision 2009/426 JHA. I thank the Deputies for their interest in this legislation. I am sure it will receive much support in this House. The legislation will assist in enhancing existing mutual assistance provisions and provide for wider and more efficient co-operation in fighting transnational crime. The increased mutual assistance powers provided here will be of use in detecting and prosecuting criminals. It is in my view essential legislation in a world where crime is international and does not respect borders. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on it.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputies for their mostly constructive comments on the Bill. As I indicated in my opening remarks, the primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, which gives effect to 12 international agreements which establish the existing legislative framework for the provision of mutual legal assistance. This Bill is necessary in order to give effect to a further six international agreements not yet provided for in the 2008 Act. These are international instruments which have already been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Most Deputies fully recognise that the Bill is not controversial but is necessary legislation required to adhere to our international agreements within the EU and with non-EU states. This legislation will assist in enhancing existing mutual assistance provisions and provide for wider and more efficient co-operation in fighting transnational crime. The international mutual assistance powers provided here will be of use in detecting and prosecuting criminals. Given that we live in a world where crime is international and does not respect any borders, this legislation is an essential part of dealing with crime. I appreciate the broad support for this legislation here in the Dáil and look forward to further debating it on Committee Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to 82A(3)(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«As the Tánaiste has done, it is important to put the facts of the matter on the record of the House. The purpose of the phased one-family payment scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside the workforce indefinitely. Prior to the reforms to the one-family payment scheme, lone parents could have been on the scheme until their youngest child turned 18 years of age, or 22 years of age if they were in full-time education. The non-conditionality nature of the payment, coupled with its very long duration, engendered many lone parents and their children to long-term welfare dependency, and effectively a welfare trap. The reforms also bring the one-family payment scheme more in line with international standards, including in Northern Ireland, where there is a general movement away from long-term and non-conditional income support, towards a more active engagement approach. In 2004, at the height of the economic boom, lone parents were more than four and a half times at risk of consistent poverty compared to the population as a whole. In 2015, lone parents are two and a half times more at risk of consistent poverty compared to the rest of the population.
Research shows that being at work, which is the key driver of this policy, reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, compared to those who do not.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The final phase of the reform will take place on 2 July 2015 when it is anticipated that approximately 29,400 one-family payment recipients, whose youngest child is seven or over, will be transitioning out of the one-family payment scheme to the jobseeker's transitional payment, the job seeker's allowance, and the family income supplement. The gain for individuals will be in the range of €10 to €150 per week, depending on their level of earnings and the number of children they have. The remaining 10,000 lone parents who are in employment and based on no change to their circumstances will suffer an income loss. This occurs as they are already in receipt of FIS or they will transition to a jobseeker's payment where the means test is less generous than the one-family payment means test. However, from this group of 10,000 approximately 6,000 will have an incentive to increase their number of hours worked in order to claim FIS and the back-to-work family dividend. These individuals will then be financially better off than their current position. The dividend is worth €1,550 per child in the first year, reducing to a 50% entitlement worth €775 per child in the second year.  The positive impact of this incentive has been evident from the increase in new FIS applications from lone parents who were affected by the reforms in both July 2013 and July 2014. This indicates that many transitioning lone parents have increased their hours of employment in order to become FIS customers. This year to date, at least 1,250 lone parents are new FIS recipients and will gain as a result of claiming FIS for the first time. It is important to put the facts and figures on the record of the House in order to have a more fully informed debate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is a very therapeutic session.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was not listening to you so I was not frowning at what you were saying.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy should not go there. He is on very shaky ground. Sinn Féin made it happen. Is the Deputy paying his bin charges?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In fairness to the Deputy, he did not write the speech.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this legislation. I might use the time available to me to remind the House of the main features of the Bill. It will abolish imprisonment for non-payment of debt and provide for two new District Court measures for the recovery of modest debts. These fair and balanced measures will ensure the ability of debtor to pay the debt is considered as a key element of the court process. The Bill will ensure that debtors are not subject to attachment or deduction orders which will bring their income levels below a reasonable standard. It is interesting that the contributions of many Opposition Deputies concentrated on matters which are not related to the Bill itself. Some Deputies made comments that suggest they would prefer if people broke the law rather than meeting their commitments. I remind the House that this Bill applies to a wide range of creditors and not just to Irish Water. I would need more than another minute to do justice to the script that has been prepared for me.It is a basic part of democracy to support citizens who pay their way and to make legislative options available for citizens who are owed money by giving them the legislative supports for its recovery. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill is a balanced measure which provides creditors with improved enforcement mechanisms in respect of modest debts, but also provides strong safeguards for debtors.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health«2011-03-09«None«The national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee, chaired by the HSE, has developed a national drugs rehabilitation framework. As Deputy O'Sullivan is aware, people in recovery have complex needs and may require multiple interventions from a range of agencies to assist them in their recovery. The aim of the framework is to provide a continuum of care for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and person-centred approach to rehabilitation based on shared care planning. The roll-out of the framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's addiction services and the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces. An evaluation of the framework, which was piloted in ten sites during 2013, found that both service users and the agencies involved in service provision, expressed a high level of enthusiasm for the framework. Those participating generally agreed that the objectives of the framework could be achieved if all agencies were committed to inter-agency working. The committee has developed national protocols under the framework to facilitate inter-agency co-operation. In addition, competency-based training is currently being designed which focuses on key working and care planning. The intention is to provide training to treatment providers and relevant agencies in 12 task force areas by the end of the year, with the remainder to receive training next year. As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am leading the development of a new national drugs strategy after 2016. The process will involve a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities. This will provide an opportunity to ensure that our strategic approach into the future continues to be firmly focused on recovery. I have also asked my Department to examine the feasibility of utilising social impact bonds as a funding model to improve both treatment and rehabilitation service outcomes. The outcome of this work will inform decisions as to the viability of this approach to maximising the social benefits which the national drugs strategy seeks to achieve.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate what the Deputy has said. We had an interesting conversation at the North Inner City Drugs Task Force. I have visited various drugs task forces around the country, particularly in the Dublin area, since my appointment to this post. I share the Deputy's concern about how this situation is changing, in that it is worsening and becoming more acute in certain parts of the country and among certain age cohorts. Today I will take part in a discussion at a joint meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the issue of decriminalisation of drugs, on which the justice committee wants to initiate a public consultation. In that, I have a lengthy contribution to make in regard to many of the issues the Deputy has raised. I am also proposing to have a conference at the end of this month in the Mansion House, with the new Lord Mayor of Dublin, in order to bring together the drugs task forces and people who are working in this sector, because I do not consider that I can wait for the review of the national drugs strategy in order to get a proper snapshot in time as to the nature of the problem we have in Ireland at the moment. That is on 29 July, and I would appreciate the Deputy's attendance and input into that conference.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I agree with everything the Deputy has said. In regard to controlled substances, I found quite disturbing what Inspector Des McTiernan of the inner city drugs task force had to say about the mother who told him it would be almost impossible for him to convince her child to get a minimum wage job in Dunnes when there is €1,000 a week to be made selling certain substances on the street corners of the inner city. We have a misuse of drugs Bill in front of the House this year and we can use that vehicle to address many of the issues the Deputy has raised. Certainly, the prevention and education element is crucial. We have to get away from the idea of victim blaming of young people who have inherited this problem that we have passed on to them. We have to have a more expansive idea of how we can engage and connect with young people. The schools system is part of that, but it is not the whole answer because children and young people do not live in schools and are influenced by many of the things that happen around them.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy McEntee for raising this important issue. The importance of early detection of cancer is fully accepted by Government. Population-based screening programmes are an important element of early detection and have been introduced for cancers in Ireland where international evidence supports this approach. At present, available evidence has given rise to population-based screening programmes being recommended for bowel, breast and cervical cancer and such programmes have been introduced here. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a prostate cancer screening programme. Instead, the focus is on the early detection of such cancers through rapid access clinics that have been established in the eight designated cancer centres. These clinics provide access to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary decision-making for prostate cancer, with patients who are deemed to be at higher risk being fast-tracked to the clinics. Men referred to these prostate clinics undergo comprehensive assessment, with appropriate imaging and biopsies. Apart from non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Ireland. In recent years, the rapid access prostate clinics have seen between 2,400 and 2,800 men annually. Approximately 1,300 of these patients each year have had a diagnosis of a prostate cancer, a diagnosis rate of 40%. It is vital, therefore, that men are aware of the symptoms of prostate diseases and present early to their GP. The Deputy's comments about the reluctance of men to do this sometimes are well made. Last month my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, launched clinical guidelines on the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with prostate cancer. These guidelines, which were approved by the national clinical effectiveness committee, represent a significant step forward in dealing with prostate cancer in Ireland. Survival from cancer has improved markedly in recent years and is expected to increase further when the long-term effects of the reforms in cancer care under the current cancer strategy, including screening programmes, impact more fully. However, it is predicted that the total number of cancer cases will rise in the coming years, with better diagnosis combined with an increasing, and aging, population. The Department of Health is currently working on the development of a national cancer strategy to provide the focus for cancer control for the next decade. A steering group has been established to inform this work. The Department of Health is currently running a public consultation process on the new strategy and I would encourage individuals, organisations and Members of this House to contribute to the process before the closing date of 24 July.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the consultation process on the new national cancer strategy, I would encourage individuals and organisations the Deputy might know to contribute to that process before the closing date of 24 July. The Department of Health and the national screening service in the HSE will continue to review emerging international evidence on screening, including any developments that arise in relation to prostate cancer. The final point I would make is that any man who has a concern about possible prostate cancer should seek the advice of his GP, who will, where necessary, refer him to a rapid access clinic. I take on board the points made by the Deputy.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am aware of reports that NAMA is seeking buyers for the loans it holds in respect of the commercial entity that owns the Dublin central development site that includes the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. Contrary to the impression being created by some of those reports, the fact is that it is loans and not properties for which NAMA is seeking expressions of interest. I am concerned that an entirely false picture is being painted about the sale of the national monument itself. It is being sold. However, the buyer is the State and not some banker or venture capitalist, the State that will safeguard and restore it to how it was in 1916, and the State that will develop a 1916 commemorative centre on the site as a solemn and fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders who held their final war council meeting there. This decision by the Government was made to bring the national monument into public ownership, secure its long-term future and complete the development of the proposed 1916 commemorative centre as quickly as possible. The Government's decision will not in any way be affected, delayed or otherwise impinged upon by any disposal of NAMA's loan books. The national monument site is being removed from the NAMA portfolio sale.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As part of the transfer of ownership to the State, all loans will be discharged over the monument site and all necessary licences and wayleaves will be put in place to carry out the national monument works. I want to be as clear as I can in the hope that it will dispel the attempt at confusion and uncertainty that has always been the hallmark of certain parties that seem to be more anxious for nothing to happen than to see the monument properly restored and opened to the public. At the risk of repeating myself, the position is that the acquisition of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on behalf of the State is in progress and will, I expect, be completed shortly. What is more, the Minister made this clear in the House in the past two weeks in answer to several parliamentary questions from Deputy McLellan. This is the clearest possible demonstration of the Government's commitment to acknowledge and mark the historical importance of the site in a positive and substantive way and to guarantee, secure and safeguard the long-term future of this historical landmark. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is actively engaged with the monument owners and other relevant parties to conclude the transfer of the property into State ownership as quickly as possible. This process is nearing completion. In common parlance, the sale is agreed. The Minister is also considering the best way to restore the buildings in order for the commemorative centre, the plans for which are being developed in consultation with the 1916 Relatives Association, to open at the earliest possible date. The Minister has informed the House on innumerable occasions that her functions in this case arise from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts with the objective of protecting No. 16 as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising. The acquisition and restoration of the monument buildings by the State for the people is the clearest possible statement of how seriously the Government has taken this objective. The commemorative centre to be housed in the restored monument buildings will be developed and run as a public facility that will enhance and complement the 1916 visitor facility being developed in the GPO from where the insurgents retreated to the Moore Street buildings. I look forward to it being completed and to seeing the public going through the doors in the centenary year of the most momentous events in our country's history.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to emphasise that the Minister has no function in the operations of NAMA and has no role in the disposal of its loans or assets. The Minister's involvement in the Moore Street issue, as she has made clear countless times, arises from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 under the National Monuments Acts.Any plans or proposals for the wider area outside the confines of the national monument are the responsibility of Dublin City Council as the planning authority. Redevelopment plans for the area have received full planning permission from An Bord Pleanála. The properties around the national monument are in private ownership. They are not subject to the Minister's remit under the National Monuments Acts. The historical significance of the fundamentally intact building at No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor when the decision was taken to make the preservation order. These buildings are the only substantially authentic, original and intact pre-1916 buildings on the street. They are the only buildings that retain significant original elements that would have been there in 1916, including staircases, partitions, plaster work, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures. Above all, Nos. 14 to 17 also contain the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents in the form of the openings broken through party walls as they tunnelled their way up the street. All of these elements are being retained, secured and permanently safeguarded as a result of the Government's decision to assume ownership of the national monument. The Minister is pressing ahead as speedily as possible to acquire the site, carry out the restoration work and have the 1916 commemorative centre open to the public. I wish I had a better timeline for the Deputies, but I do not. I look forward to the day work gets started on the Moore Street project. All of our citizens can look forward with pride to the day it opens its doors to welcome the public as a fitting testament to the men and women of 1916 and what they fought for. There are more discussions to be had, not least with the traders who occupy the street and do their daily business there. Subject to agreement, we hope to have a wrap going around those four buildings in the very near future. This will be a solid indication of the Government's intention to establish a lasting monument to the sacrifices of those who fought that week and had their final meetings in this historic building.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the motion. It is timely and well constructed. The contributions from both sides of the House serve us well as a Department when we deal with the issues around older people. As the Tánaiste outlined, there have been major challenges in recent years and it is a good time to take stock as to where we are and where we intend to go. One of my responsibilities relates to the 2016 commemorations and as part of the consultation process we have organised a number of meetings around the country to get feedback from people. The number of people of an older generation who were still fascinated and determined to make their contribution and still have the ethic of citizenship that may have diminished or been lost somewhat over the years was remarkable. When one engages with people of a certain generation who understand the citizenship ethic, who understand what it means to be a citizen of a country and who want to play their part in commemorating what has happened in the country over the past 100 years, and when they tell stories of their families, communities and where they come from, it is inspiring. It is only when we listen to them and learn from them that we can hope to build something brighter for the future.I want to ensure people play their full role and feel part of next year's commemorations. We are in a period of reflection on Irish history, not least because we are coming out of a particularly difficult and painful economic turbulent time. We are also in a period of reflection of the past 100 years and building for the next 100 years. We have to discuss our values, the ones about which we feel strongly and, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan rightly said, about making this a country for old people. That is one of the aspirations to which we have to cling rigidly. Our population is aging rapidly with advances in health care leading to a dramatic rise in our older population. This is a positive development. It should never be construed otherwise or suggested these are resources that could be spent elsewhere. Each year, the total number of persons over the age of 65 is growing by around 20,000. Projections indicate this will continue to increase with the impact being more significant in the over 85 age group. We should celebrate this as the success story that it is. The Government is strongly committed to protecting and advancing the policies and services necessary to promote all aspects of growing older. Maintaining good health is the key to living well for longer. Older people are now staying healthy for longer than was previously the case. It is important society supports us all as we age, as well as providing access to high quality health and care services along with supports from primary care through to acute care, community, residential and end-of-life care. The Government’s policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This is where people have consistently said they want to be supported. We must consider how we can best respond to this clear preference. There is now a stronger emphasis on home care and other community services which provide a greater range of options to avoid admission to acute hospitals, support early discharges and, where appropriate, to rehabilitate and re-enable patients after periods of particular difficulty. The Health Service Executive provides a range of community-based services aimed at ensuring older people receive safe, timely and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity and as close to home as possible. In its national service plan, NSP, for 2015 the HSE stated it will continue to progress the strategic realignment of services to provide home care and community support services to maximise the potential of older people in their own homes and communities. The levels of home supports planned for in the NSP are 10.3 million hours of home help service supporting 50,000 people. This is the same level of service as 2014. Up to 13,800 people will be in receipt of a home care package at any one time. This includes an additional 600 people supported under the delayed discharges initiative. Up to 190 people will be in receipt of an intensive home care package at any one time. These packages were introduced for the first time in 2014 for people with more complex care needs. An additional €2 million has been allocated in 2015 to expand the coverage of community intervention teams with a particular focus on hospital avoidance and earlier discharge from acute hospitals in the greater Dublin area. In line with programme for Government commitments, our priority has been to modernise mental health services and to resource implementation of the widely agreed policy, A Vision for Change. Since 2012, the Government has provided additional ring-fenced funding of €125 million, resulting in around 1,150 posts of the type required to re-balance services towards greater community-based provision. The funding includes, among other measures, provision of enhanced specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness. It reflects well on this Parliament when we can come together to agree a value statement for what we collectively believe in and try to deliver. This Chamber can often be a place of theatre, grandstanding and political point scoring. However, sometimes we do not give enough credit to ourselves for the level of collective understanding we have of what our people need. Older people living longer is to be celebrated. In this time of national reflection as we challenge ourselves to think of the values that underpin this Republic, this House has always striven to protect our older citizens, particularly those who may not have a family network to support them. The State has done well in this regard in its history. Over the past eight years we have done the best we could despite budgetary constraints. We are in a position to improve now. The test for our value system will be how much we invest in this area. We can never suggest that someone’s dignity, wisdom and experience are too expensive to invest in. Many of the contributions tonight were very worthy of this House. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of the great campaigners of Yes Equality, the marriage equality group and GLEN. I acknowledge the ICCL also played a huge role in that campaign. It is a proud day today for our Republic to have this Bill before the House. I recall the day the marriage equality referendum was passed and the sense of us actually reclaiming our republic. I pay tribute to Deputy Eamon Gilmore for putting this matter on the political agenda and ensuring it made its way into the programme for Government, to the Government for proceeding with the Constitutional Convention and to the members of the Constitutional Convention who passed a resolution to ensure the Government proceeded with the referendum on marriage equality. I pay tribute also to the entire body politic which got behind that referendum and then stepped aside and allowed the people of Ireland to make it their referendum. The leadership shown by the Yes Equality people was remarkable. It was a positive campaign. It was something unique. I do not believe that if I spend the remainder of my life involved in politics I will ever again feel anything like I felt in Dublin Castle on the day of the announcement. The colour, excitement and sense that we had reclaimed a little of our Republic was great. A huge number of people, having been failed by this country and fled it for economic reasons, came home on boats and aeroplanes from far afield to cast their votes in this referendum to ensure that this Republic, as we face into the 1916 commemorations, have a different view of what being a Republic truly means. I recall quoting that essential line from the Proclamation time and again at meetings throughout the country, that people open up their hearts to their neighbours and tell them about the lonely lives they have led and their aspirations for their partners and for their futures and families. Equal rights and equal opportunities for all our citizens are not matters to be left only to the Proclamation; these must be underpinned in our laws and Constitution. We would be foolish to think the battle is now won. There is much yet to be achieved for our LGBT brothers and sisters and community. I reference section 37 of the Employment Equality Act which has been amended by the Seanad and will hopefully be agreed by the Dáil later this year and will ensure that members of the LGBT community and others who feel that they cannot be themselves while working in institutions funded by the State but under religious patronage will have the freedom to be who they want to be. Earlier this year the Gender Recognition Act was passed, which is monumental legislation. There is other legislation we need to work hard to ensure is enacted, in particular hate crime legislation. GLEN has been lobbying over a number of years to ensure that people can socialise as they want to and not feel under threat of attack or intimidation. For this reason, I wish to inform the House that I am beginning preparations on a national LGBT strategy, which will be important. There are many other strategies in place across the equality sphere for other people in society who need to have their voices heard and to ensure that all agencies of the State are listening to what they have to say and advancing their role in society. There are many battles to be fought for the LGBT community, including on the sports field, in advertising, education, health and so on. We need to have consultation on formulation of an LGBT strategy that looks to five, ten or 15 years hence in terms of what life will be like for our LGBT brothers and sisters. To assume that marriage equality has ended the discrimination against gay, lesbian, bi-sexual and transgender people would be a foolish assumption. This is only the start of the conversation as to how we build a Republic of equals. There are many other groups in our society who wish, in terms of their needs, that they had that moment in Dublin Castle. I know the Traveller groups feel strongly about attaining Traveller ethnicity for themselves. There are many migrants and refugees coming here who want to feel they are part of this Republic and to have a better future. Other groups include people living in areas of disadvantage and those who suffer illiteracy. Reference was made at the Right to Read Literary Conference held in Dublin today to 17% of our adult population suffering from functional illiteracy. These are issues on which we have to galvanise ourselves. We must reassure ourselves that when we appeal to the decency and humanity of Irish people there is nothing that we cannot achieve. I may have been very negative at the beginning of this year, and was accused of being so, when I said that this referendum could be lost. Perhaps the lesson for everybody in this House is that if we appeal to people's fears we may achieve something but if we appeal to people's humanity and their aspirations for something better and the true sense of being republican there is nothing that cannot be achieved. I congratulate those who were involved in this campaign and who made it the people's campaign. I congratulate people across this House who stood together and fought this good fight. I also congratulate the Irish people for coming out in such huge numbers to support it, in particular the young people of Ireland for showing the rest of us exactly what politics should be about and I call on everybody to strengthen their resolve to ensure that we can achieve more and do more to proclaim a proper Republic.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Fianna Fáil touched a nerve with the Irish people.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now Read a Second Time." On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I thank Deputies for making the necessary time available to deal with the Second Stage debate on the Choice of Court (Hague Convention) Bill 2015. Members will be aware that the Bill has already passed all Stages in Seanad Éireann. I hope it can be enacted speedily, given that the Hague Convention on 30 June 2005 on choice of court agreements came into force on 1 October. The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the measures which are required to ensure that the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on choice of court agreements can function effectively within the Irish legal system.While the Bill is short and technical in nature, it is of significance in terms of enabling us to fulfil our EU obligations. It is also of significance because the convention to which it relates has the potential, over time, to create a more predictable legal environment for companies that do business with third countries. That predictability should, in turn, encourage companies to be more confident in expanding their trading relationships with such countries. The Bill contains 11 sections, all of which are technical in nature. Its key provisions are contained in sections 5, 6 and 9. Section 5 provides that an application under the convention for the recognition and enforcement in the State of a judgment shall be made to the Master of the High Court and that the Master may make an order for the recognition or enforcement of only part of a judgment. Section 6 provides that if an enforcement order has been made in respect of a judgment, that judgment shall, to the extent authorised by the enforcement order, be of the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court, and that proceedings for its enforcement may be taken accordingly. Section 6, as published, was amended in Seanad Éireann to make it subject to section 7. The effect of the amendment is that, when it comes to enforcement in Ireland, the interest provisions of the country where the judgment was given shall apply and not the Irish provisions. A new section 9 was inserted in the Seanad, which has the effect of giving an explicit jurisdiction to the Master of the High Court to grant protective measures to a judgment creditor where that creditor seeks such measures in the context of applying to have a convention judgment enforced. In the absence of such a power, there would be a risk that a judgment debtor would be given the opportunity to put assets in Ireland beyond the reach of the creditor before enforcement could take place. Article 7 of the convention makes it clear that interim measures of protection are not governed by the terms of the convention, and their grant or otherwise is a matter to be regulated by national law. Under our national law, in the absence of an express provision, our courts would not have jurisdiction to grant these measures in respect of convention judgments. It would not be in keeping with the spirit of the convention if, in the context of an enforcement application, every effort was not made to ensure that enforcement would be effective. For this reason, a provision akin to that in respect of the Brussels I regulation and Lugano Convention regimes is to be introduced for Hague Convention purposes. Other provisions are ancillary to these provisions. Section 1 contains relevant definitions which are self-explanatory. Section 2 authorises the Minister for Justice and Equality to make certain orders in respect of convention matters, most notably that a specified state is a state bound by the convention or that particular declarations or communications have been made. While such orders are in force, they will be of evidential value. This is a standard evidential provision, the rationale for which is to avoid taking up court time in proving that a particular state is a contracting state or the existence or contents of a declaration or denunciation made under the convention. Obviously, such a provision also has the beneficial effect of avoiding costs which would otherwise be incurred in proving these matters. Section 3 states that the convention has force of law in the State, while section 4 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the convention, the explanatory report prepared in respect of it and relevant court judgments. The latter provision is in aid of the uniform interpretation of the convention, which is important in an international agreement of this nature and is an objective of the convention. A provision of the type set out in section 4 has been included in various legislation to come before the Houses in recent years. A recent example is the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 2011, which concerns the 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Section 7 deals with provisions on enforcement orders for the payment of interest on judgments and the payment of costs. Section 8 deals with the proof and admissibility of certain judgments and related documents and translations. Section 10 contains a technical provision to bring section 20A of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1998 into line with the provisions of section 7 of the Bill. Section 11 contains standard citation provisions. At this stage, I will address the background to and detail of the convention. The choice of court convention, to use a convenient shorthand, was negotiated under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. The Hague Conference is a body that facilitates the development of multilateral legal instruments across a range of areas. In the past, conventions have been negotiated which touch upon commercial matters, family law matters and administrative co-operation. With 80 members, including the European Union, representing all continents, the Hague Conference on Private International Law is a global intergovernmental organisation. A melting pot of different legal traditions, it develops and services multilateral legal instruments which respond to global needs. Apart from European Union member states, the Hague Conference includes among its membership countries such as China, the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and Russia. The convention is geared towards the promotion of choice of court agreements in international business to business contracts. Within the EU, a legal framework is already in place which ensures that choice of court agreements are honoured. However, there is no equivalent framework at the international level, and the convention will fill this gap. Negotiations on the convention concluded in June 2005 after a negotiating period of slightly more than two years. This convention is much narrower in scope when compared to the one that was originally contemplated. It evolved from earlier work which had been ongoing within the Hague Conference for a number of years. That work was very ambitious in aim and would have resulted in a convention which prescribed a list of approved grounds of jurisdiction as well as a list of prohibited grounds of jurisdiction. Judgments based on the former list would be entitled to recognition and enforcement in other contracting states to the convention and would obviously have facilitated the circulation of a greater volume of judgments at global level. However, it became clear that it would not be possible to bring this work to a successful conclusion, and eventually it was agreed to work on a convention with a reduced scope, which would deal only with choice of court agreements in international commercial cases. The European Commission presented a proposal for a Council decision authorising signature of the convention in September 2008. One of the reasons informing the presentation of the proposal at that time was the perception that, when in force, the choice of court convention would reduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside the European Union. Following the proposal's adoption by Council, the convention was signed in April 2009. It was also signed by the United States in January of the same year. The European Union has exclusive competence in respect of the matters governed by the choice of court convention and, therefore, Ireland will not ratify the convention in its own right. At the time of signature of the convention, the European Community, as the European Union was then known, made a declaration indicating that it exercised competence over all the matters governed by the convention and member states would be bound by the convention by virtue of its conclusion by the Community. This is a routine arrangement for international instruments for which the European Union has exclusive competence. Several years elapsed before the Commission produced a proposal for the conclusion of the convention in January 2014. The main reason for the lapse of time was the need to bring to a conclusion to the revision work on the Brussels I regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. That work was brought to a conclusion in December 2012, and the new regulation that resulted, which has applied since January of this year, contains amendments which align the choice of court provisions that had existed at European Union level with those provided for in the Hague Convention, thereby facilitating the approval of the choice of court convention by the EU. The proposal for a decision authorising approval of the convention was adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council at its meeting on 4 and 5 December 2014. Under its terms, the instrument of approval was to be deposited within one month of 5 June 2015, and the deposit took place on 11 June last. Mexico had already acceded to the convention in September 2007 and, under the terms of the convention, approval by the European Union triggered the entry into force of the convention on 1 October this year - that is, last Thursday. This timetable for EU approval was influenced by the fact that, as part of the negotiation process, it was agreed that member states would be given some time to make any legislative changes which were needed at the domestic level prior to the approval of the convention, which brings us to where we are today. In general terms, a typical choice of court agreement will specify that the courts of a particular state should have jurisdiction to hear proceedings under the contract that exists between the parties. Such agreements are widely viewed as being beneficial in terms of creating a stable trading environment for international commerce. However, their value is critically dependent upon the extent to which the parties can be confident that their agreement will be upheld by a court if litigation ensues. This arises both in respect of the court chosen being willing to take jurisdiction and also in respect of other courts being willing to recognise and enforce the judgment given on foot of the choice of court agreement. To take a concrete example, a company may be reluctant to do business with a particular state because it either mistrusts or is unfamiliar with its legal system. However, if a supplier of goods is confident that, in the event of any issues arising regarding the payment of the goods which have been delivered, a court in which it trusts will have jurisdiction to rule on the dispute, it may be emboldened to proceed with the deal. The other party, which wishes to receive the goods, may be equally happy to agree to a court in which it too has confidence. In the alternative, the fact that the state with which the supplier wishes to do business is a contracting party to the choice of court convention may encourage a feeling of security in terms of being willing to accept a choice of court agreement in favour of that country. In this regard, it is noteworthy that research exists which indicates, particularly in the case of large businesses, that significant business decisions can be influenced by uncertainty regarding the court that would resolve disputes or the law that would apply to the contract. In effect, lack of legal certainty may function as a barrier to trade. The convention aims to ensure the effectiveness of choice of court agreements by providing guarantees that the chosen court will hear the case when proceedings are brought before it. Linked with this is a requirement that any other court before which proceedings are pending must refuse to entertain those proceedings. Provision is made to ensure that judgments given under the convention will be entitled to recognition and enforcement in those states which are contracting parties to the convention.None of these principles is absolute but the overall aim is to find the right balance between flexibility and certainty. I will now deal in some detail with the key provisions of the convention and highlight certain articles which are probably the most important in terms of its overall content. Article 1 defines the scope of the convention. The relevant case must be international in nature, the choice of court agreement must be exclusive and the subject matter must fall within the range of what is normally understood by the term "civil and commercial". Article 3 sets out the formal requirements that must be satisfied if a choice of court agreement is to fall under the convention. Article 5 is a key provision in that it mandates the court designated in the agreement to hear a case unless the agreement is null and void under the law of the relevant state. Article 5 is complemented by article 6 which requires a court not designated in the agreement to suspend or dismiss proceedings even if it has jurisdiction under national law. There are a number of exceptions to this rule, including, for example, circumstances in which giving effect to the agreement would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the state of the court seised or where the chosen court has decided not to hear the case. Article 8 sets out the principle that a judgment given by a court of a contracting state which is designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement must be recognised and enforced in another contracting state in accordance with the convention's provisions. By way of exception to this principle, Article 9 sets out the grounds upon which recognition and enforcement may be refused, for example, where there has been procedural fraud or where a party lacked the capacity to conclude the agreement under the law of the state where enforcement is sought. Article 13 lists the documents which are to be produced when enforcement is being applied for. Article 16 deals with transitional arrangements and sets out the basic principle that the convention will only apply to exclusive choice of court agreements concluded after the convention comes into force for the state of the chosen court. Articles 19 to 22 contain provisions setting out the range of declarations which a contracting state may make. In this regard, Article 19 permits a contracting state to refuse to apply the convention to cases where, except for the choice of court clause, there is no connection between that state and the parties or the dispute. Article 20 allows a state not to enforce a judgment where all of the factors, other than the choice of court clause, are internal to it. Article 21 allows a state to exclude a specific matter from the scope of the convention and the EU has availed of this provision in relation to certain types of insurance contract. Article 22 allows for the making of reciprocal declarations to extend the scope of the convention to cover non-exclusive choice of court agreements. An example of such an agreement would be one which designated the courts of two or more contracting states to the exclusion of all others. Article 26 deals with the relationship of the convention with other international instruments and is of interest because it deals with the situation where a regional economic integration organisation such as the EU becomes a contracting party to the convention. In essence, where a case is purely regional in terms of the residence of the parties, the convention gives way to any relevant regional instrument which might exist. Furthermore, it will not affect the rules governing the recognition or enforcement of judgments between the member states of the regional organisation. Within the EU the recognition and enforcement regime is much more liberal than that which exists under the convention. I referred earlier to the fact that Mexico has already acceded to the convention. Both the USA and Singapore have signed it and it is hoped that EU approval will encourage other states to become parties to it. Ratification of the convention by as many states as possible should encourage commercial actors to avail of choice of court clauses when doing business in those states because they can be secure in the knowledge that they can rely upon its provisions. I am pleased to say that Ireland has a solid and deepening trade relationship with Mexico. In 2013, trade between the countries was of the order of €1.277 billion, constituting €928 million in the export from Ireland of goods and services and €349 million in the import from Mexico of goods and services. Ireland's principal merchandise exports to Mexico are soft drink concentrate, chemical materials and products. Ireland's main merchandise imports from Mexico are medical devices, miscellaneous plastics, stents and telecommunications and sound equipment. The value of Ireland's exports of goods to Mexico in 2014 increased by 76%, from €692 million to €1.216 billion. Of the states which have signed the convention, the USA is Ireland's biggest goods export market, with the value of goods exported in 2014 standing at almost €20 billion. As a trading bloc, the 28 member states of the European Union traded goods worth €515 billion with the USA in the same year. The €54 billion trade between Ireland and the USA in the preceding year, 2013, can be broken down evenly between imports and exports of both goods and services. Ireland's most significant exports to the US are organic chemicals which are mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry, and medical and pharmaceutical products. Ireland's main imports from the USA are royalties and licences, and research and development services. Trade with Singapore is understandably more modest. Trade between Ireland and Singapore in 2013 was valued at a little over €2 billion, which breaks down as €1.359 billion in the export of goods and services, and €717 million in imports. The trade relationship is mainly focused on computers, computer parts and storage devices. The EU trade bloc has a healthy trade relationship with Singapore expressed in trade in goods to the value of some €47 billion in 2013. As already stated, EU accession to the convention should have a beneficial effect in terms of encouraging other states which are members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law to become parties to it. In addition, the convention is also open to states which are not members of the conference. Even in markets where the EU is already very active, widespread adherence to the convention could have the potential to lead to further growth in trade. To take two examples where Ireland has a specific interest, Ireland's trade relationship with Australia in goods was valued at €802 million in 2013, while trade in goods between the EU as a whole and Australia in that year was valued at €33 billion. Of the EU's €59 billion trade in goods with Canada in 2013, €2.5 billion came from the exchange of goods between Ireland and Canada. Ireland's relationships with both Canada and Australia are not, of course, focused solely on trade but rather are grounded in the deeper ties of family, cultural affinities and shared democratic political traditions. The details I have just outlined highlight the importance to all our economies of international trade. The progressive elimination of barriers to trade means that now, more than ever, predictability and certainty are vital in the area of business and commercial relationships within Europe and beyond. Business people need to be sure that they can readily enforce contracts and secure judgments for what can, in some cases, be large sums of money. Measures aimed at promoting such security have the twin effects of both protecting existing trade and encouraging new trade. In recent years, much emphasis has been placed at EU level on initiative, Justice for Growth. The Bill and the convention to which it relates are a small but practical example of the way in which justice policy can contribute towards improving the conditions for EU businesses which are active in trading with partners outside the EU. The EU has exclusive competence in respect of the matters governed by the choice of court convention and Ireland will not be ratifying it in its own right. Nevertheless, the implementing measures which are set out in this Bill are required to ensure that the convention can be applied within our legal system. I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the Bill, which I hope can be enacted speedily given that the convention came into force on 1 October last. I commend the Bill to the House.

We could probably do with a few such players this evening.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate for the observations they made. I appreciate the welcoming and open atmosphere in which the discussions of this somewhat technical Bill have taken place. This reflects the fact that the legislation we are dealing with is not especially controversial in character, which is probably the reason I am speaking pretty much to myself in the Chamber. Notwithstanding its technical nature, this Bill has a part to play in promoting and supporting Ireland as a successful trading nation. The development and maintenance of trade relations are, of course, important at any time but they are of particular importance to Ireland and the European Union as we emerge from past economic difficulties. As I said in my earlier intervention, legal certainty and predictability can contribute towards the progressive elimination of barriers to trade and can enable business and commercial relationships to flourish both within the EU and outside it. Commercial bodies need to be certain that they can readily enforce contracts and secure enforcement of judgments for what can be, in some cases, quite significant sums of money. In a small way, this Bill and the convention it implements can help to protect and promote Irish business interests abroad. Deputies will appreciate the fact that Ireland is a trade-dependent nation. The Choice of Court Convention creates legal certainty and predictability by establishing a framework for upholding choice of court agreements in cases that end up before the courts of countries bound by this convention. The guarantees offered by this framework should allow parties to trade with greater confidence than heretofore. While the legislation we are considering is mandated by our membership of the European Union, it is very much in our own interest to legislate in a progressive fashion in this area. As Deputies may not be very familiar with the work of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, perhaps I could say a few words about that body. The Hague Conference is a body of long standing. It held its first meeting in 1893 and became a permanent intergovernmental organisation in 1955. Its 80 members are representative of all continents. In addition to the 28 member states of the European Union, and the European Union itself, its membership includes countries as diverse as China, Japan, Russia, Peru, Egypt, Monaco, South Africa and the United States of America. A melting pot of different legal traditions, it develops and provides support services for multilateral legal instruments which respond to global needs. An increasing number of non-member states are also becoming parties to the various Hague conventions and, as a result, the work of the conference encompasses more than 145 countries around the world. In addition to the type of commercial relationships encompassed by the Choice of Court Convention, personal and family disputes in more than one country are commonplace in the modern world. Faced with disputes which have an international element, courts will apply their private international law rules, and these rules may differ from country to country. The statutory mission of the Hague Conference is to work for the progressive unification of these rules. This involves finding internationally agreed approaches to issues such as jurisdiction of the courts, applicable law, and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in a wide range of areas, from commercial law and banking law to international civil procedure and from child protection to matters of marriage and personal status. Ireland is bound by eight Hague conventions and a protocol associated with one of those conventions, which cover areas as diverse as the civil aspects of international child abduction, protection of children and co-operation in respect of inter-country adoption, and the service abroad of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters. In conclusion, I would like to make the following points about the Choice of Court Convention and the regime which it applies. It is mainly intended as an optional worldwide judicial alternative to the existing arbitration system, which is also widely used by commercial parties. Its approval by the EU should reduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside the EU by ensuring that choice of court agreements included in their international trading contracts are respected, and that judgments issued by the courts designated in such agreements will be eligible for recognition in the other countries that are contracting parties to the convention. The convention fills a void in the current international legal framework, as virtually no treaty relationships exist in this area between the individual member states and the EU's main trading partners. In this context, an impact assessment prepared by the Commission suggests that uncertainty regarding which court would resolve disputes was a factor taken into account when reaching significant business decisions, and the legal uncertainty in this area was identified as a potential barrier to trade. That assessment also noted that the vast majority of commercial contracts contain provisions which deal with dispute resolution and that a significant percentage of such contracts include an exclusive choice of court clause. As I said at the outset, this Bill is largely an exercise in the promotion of legal certainty. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to explore these matters further. Once again, I would like to thank Members for their contributions to our discussions today.

The Government put in place one of the most comprehensive public consultation processes ever seen in this country, with over 80 very well attended public meetings across the country, in every county. A new public holiday was not sought; nor was there support to move the focus of commemoration from Easter to 24 April. In this regard, I note that the Bill has been sold in the media as an opportunity to introduce an additional public holiday next year, but this is disingenuous. The Bill would, in fact, introduce a new public holiday in perpetuity, but there has been no discussion of the cost of such an additional annual holiday. Next year will be a time for reflection, celebration and commemoration. It is not a year for singular narratives of the events of Easter 1916 but one in which we embrace the multiplicity of traditions on our island and celebrate our independence. The Ireland 2016 centenary programme
is a fully inclusive programme.It contains formal State commemorations and a broad programme of events and initiatives planned in partnership with the national cultural institutions, universities, State bodies and agencies, local authorities, local communities and a number of other interested individuals and groups. That this programme is a cross-government, non-political initiative in which all citizens regardless of political background are encouraged to take part should not be underestimated. This is the key to ensuring broad participation in the events being planned for next year and is a sentiment which featured strongly in the various consultations conducted in recent months. Those who attended the consultation meetings did not want the commemorations to become a party political football.  There has been widespread support for the programme across the political spectrum and significant engagement at both national and local levels throughout the country and abroad. The programme was drafted following extensive consultation with a range of stakeholders and was welcomed by the expert advisory group on commemorations, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, and the all-party consultation group on commemorations, of which Deputy Ó Snodaigh is a member. Only yesterday, we launched 31 individual local authority plans to commemorate the centenary of 1916. Local communities have taken the themes of Ireland 2016 and developed exciting and innovative plans for next year covering art, historical reflection, community events, events involving children and young people and a range of other activities, all of which have been designed to be inclusive and reflect the diversity of opinion on the events of 1916. My colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, recently launched an extensive nationwide programme of activities for primary and post-primary schools, including research projects, competitions and awards as part of the youth and imagination strand of the programme. The Government's "Flag for Schools" initiative has got off to a great start, with more than 700 flags already delivered to primary schools by members of the Defence Forces. We are also working with the third level institutions which have developed extensive and reflective programmes for 2016. For example, only this week, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht launched the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, programme, which offers a range of activities for next year. On Saturday last, I launched the Department's Culture Ireland international programme, I Am Ireland, which is a key element of the Ireland 2016 global and diaspora strand of the Ireland 2016 programme. It is a programme of celebration through contemporary arts which also reflects on Ireland's cultural journey over the past 100 years. The Arts Council and national cultural institutions also have extensive programmes planned for next year. The diaspora will also be involved in events next year and our network of embassies abroad has developed a range of activities to engage with the diaspora and local communities. Full details of the programme were launched in June and it continues to grow. The core of the programme will be the State commemorative events, including ceremonies at the GPO on Easter Sunday and events at Kilmainham Gaol and Arbour Hill. Many events will also take place at local level on an annual basis. Next year, a range of additional commemorative events will be held to mark the centenary of the Rising and the existing Easter bank holiday will provide an appropriate opportunity for a major public celebration to mark the end of the Easter commemorative events. This will build on the very successful Road to the Rising Easter Monday events in Dublin this year. It is clear the forthcoming year will be a year of solemn remembrance, reflection and celebration. It will also be a once in a lifetime opportunity to re-imagine our future, reflect on the ideals of the Proclamation and use this learning as inspiration for this generation. The Government will continue to work with everyone to ensure the Ireland 2016 centenary programme is a success. This Bill seeks to distract from the Easter weekend commemoration. It seeks to provide an additional public holiday in perpetuity for which there is no public demand and to use a singular narrative which could undermine the respectful and inclusive approach to all commemorations on this island which the House supports.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The Government will not oppose the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014 sponsored by Deputy Anne Ferris. I congratulate her on the work she has done on this issue and I look forward to discussion on the detail of the Deputy’s proposals on Committee Stage. Age discrimination should not be countenanced. I am the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, and equality issues are dear to my heart and central to my reason for being in politics. However, there are serious policy issues in this proposal which need careful consideration. A simple change to equality legislation may not be the vehicle in which to capture all the nuances that need to be taken into account and all the legitimate interests that need to be balanced when we think about work and retirement issues. The Bill is presented as an amendment to equality legislation that would have the effect of abolishing mandatory retirement ages, save in specified security related employment. Those security related exemptions in respect of An Garda Síochána, the Prison Service, fire services and so on are welcome and necessary, and this reflects the position in existing equality legislation. This would be a radical step and the issues that arise in considering such a radical measure as is proposed in the Bill are not fundamentally equality issues but have wider ramifications. The proposal in the Bill would involve setting aside the retirement provisions of most existing employment contracts on a unilateral basis and would have serious implications for public sector employment, pensions policy and labour market policy generally. It would appear from our reading of the Bill that the setting aside of existing employment contract provisions would operate on the basis that the employee still had a choice to retire at the contractual date whereas the employer would not have a choice. This arises due to the interplay between compulsory and voluntary retirement in the precise text of the proposed amendments. That seems to be very problematic from a legal point of view. State intervention in private contracts to abolish on a unilateral basis the retirement arrangements entered into by the two parties would be of doubtful legality and would need careful consideration following comprehensive legal advice. A one-sided abolition raises even more serious doubts as to its fairness and constitutionality. We will need to think carefully about the objective we are trying to achieve and whether we can find other approaches that avoid legal pitfalls. It is important to note that EU equality law provides expressly for compulsory retirement ages. When the EU Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004, reliance was placed on the wording of Recital 14 of the Directive, "(14) This Directive shall be without prejudice to national provisions laying down retirement ages", to conclude that it was not necessary to amend section 34(4) Employment Equality Act 1998, "Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees." However, case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific terms of the directive. In particular Article 6.1 entitled “Justification of differences of treatment on grounds of age” provides that:Member States may provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.The CJEU has, in the course of a series of judgments, applied this test to national compulsory retirement schemes. The High Court, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal have applied this test in Irish cases. As a result, the text of section 34(4), which I quoted and which seems to give carte blanche to employers to set any age as a retirement age, does not reflect the law as it is actually applied. The opportunity of the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 is being taken therefore to amend section 34(4) to reflect the law as interpreted by the CJEU. The new text as accepted by the Seanad will read:(4) Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees if-(a) it is objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, and(b) the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.The Bill has finished all Stages in the Seanad and is awaiting Dáil time. I am advised that this amendment, which focuses on the same section that Deputy Ferris’s Bill addresses, will go as far as it is appropriate to go in regulating retirement ages from an equality perspective. After that, the advice from the Department of Justice and Equality and the other Departments with central policy concerns is that the issue becomes too complex, with a range of interests and policy objectives to be balanced, for equality legislation. The essential point is that our national retirement age regime must be considered in the wider context of national employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives and national pension policy. These extend across the whole of Government. In no particular order of importance, the relevant issues in respect of which there would be implications that need careful consideration by the relevant policy Departments are as follows. In terms of pensions policy and pension schemes, the immediate implications for affordability may be positive as persons expected to retire shortly choose not to do so, but there may be implications for pension contributions calculated actuarially which could have an opposite effect. In employment law, the retirement clause in existing contracts would be made void without reference to the wishes of the contracting parties. The detail of the Private Members’ Bill would allow an employee discretion to retire at the previously envisaged age but leave no choice for an employer. Voiding a contractual agreement in such a one-sided way may itself be legally problematic. In respect of labour market and employment policy, the consideration is whether a reduction in expected numbers leaving employment may reduce opportunities for young people or advancement opportunities for people at an earlier stage of their careers. Youth employment remains a priority challenge. Older workers must be protected against discrimination. Our law and EU law allow for compulsory retirement ages, provided these can be objectively justified. Putting in place a clear national policy framework to help the State, employees and employers to know the appropriate balance in specific circumstances requires us to consider the range of relevant objectives, including competing objectives if one looks at the problem of youth employment, for example. I look forward to the detailed examination of these issues on Committee Stage and to the contributions of other Deputies in the debate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«She can smoke a pipe.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is exactly what happened.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and also on the "When Will the Election be Held?" Bill 2015. Or is it 2016? As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are making an important amendment to the retirement age provisions in our Employment Equality Acts and another Private Members' Bill is due to come before the Dáil from the Seanad as soon as a time slot is made available to us. This amendment reflects the evolution of EU law as interpreted by the European Court of Justice and the jurisprudence of our national courts, and will go as far as appropriate in regulating retirement ages from an equality perspective. After this, a national retirement age regime must be considered in the wider context of national employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and national pension policy. These extend across the whole of Government, including pensions policy and schemes, employment law, the labour market, and employment policy in the context of major unemployment, which remains a priority challenge. Wider work on retirement policy issues was previously taken forward in a working group on working and retirement under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection. The Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Justice and Equality were also represented on the working group. The social partners were also involved in the working group. Further consideration of the range of policy issues must be addressed in a cross-departmental way in consultation with the social partners. We have had such discussions about strengthening Oireachtas oversight in pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas, taking the initiative in consulting with society at large on policy issues so as to inform the decision-making process. While I would not wish to instruct any committee on how it should go about its business, I agree that there would be a very useful role for the relevant Oireachtas committee to take the lead on further analysis and consideration of the wider context in which retirement age questions must be examined. This could be done by undertaking further consultation with all stakeholders before the detailed examination of the Bill to ensure the detailed examination is fully informed by the views of all relevant stakeholders. My Department and other Departments with lead roles in the relevant policy areas will be very happy to support the committee system in that work. Again, I thank Deputy Anne Ferris for introducing the Bill. There are important issues which we need to consider in detail, and the Oireachtas is well placed to initiate consultations in a wider context with all those who have an interest in retirement age and work-life balance issues. In terms of the potential for a forthcoming election, there is plenty of work I would like to proceed with during the coming months, including the international protection Bill, the misuse of drugs Bill, the family leave Bill, and amending section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 on Traveller ethnicity. There are many matters I would like to knuckle down to and get over the line.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It will take months rather than weeks to get it done.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Quite a number of issues have been raised. In regard to Hungary, many of the comments from Hungary have upset people, including many Irish people, considering that, in the 1950s in particular, Ireland reached out the hand of friendship to Hungarian refugees. The official position is that it is not helpful in a European context to comment on a position adopted by any particular partner because each member state will have its own national challenges and concerns from its own perspective. We should understand that, just as we expect Irish views to be respected by others. However, all actions by the authorities in any member state should respect and reflect the high human rights standards we have in Europe. I hear the Deputy's comments in regard to Turkey. Turkey is a hugely important partner for all of us in the European Union, a point that has come into even sharper focus as we formulate our collective response to the current crisis. It plays a geographically and politically central role in its region, and as an EU neighbour and candidate country. It is currently host to well over 2 million refugees; therefore, it is hard to imagine solutions to the crisis which do not involve it substantially. The importance of the EU and Turkey working together was clearly recognised in a joint EU-Turkey action plan, which was welcomed at the European Council last Thursday. No one is under any illusion that it would be anything less than challenging to step up our co-operation, but it is important to engage with Turkey and to help bring about change in that country. Many of the issues the Deputy raised are relevant. We hope that rapid progress can be made over the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan. It is worth recalling that Turkey is an EU candidate country which has been in accession negotiations since December 2004. Fourteen out of 34 chapters have been opened for negotiation, of which one has been provisionally closed. We must also remember that enlargement is a conditional process. The October European Council endorsed the action plan and called for the accession negotiations to be re-energised. However, this will only be in accordance with a negotiating framework and the relevant Council conclusions. Our funding for refugee camps is handled mainly through the UNHCR World Food Programme. We have already decided to donate an additional €30 million to our core funding over the next three years. We are also actively considering additional contributions in the various new EU funds.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am keen to make the point at the outset that it is to the credit of the House and the political system in the country that we do not have a political debate in Ireland based around resistance to refugees coming to Ireland. That is to the credit of the House and the political parties operating within it. As Deputies will know, throughout Europe there is major resistance and growing xenophobia. However, in Ireland the pressure and lobbying is for a humanitarian response, with people wanting us to be more generous. There is no political capital to be gained from the opposite point of view, and that is to our credit as a political collective. No general election or any election has ever been dominated by the issues of migration, emigration or refugees. I hope that continues in future. Deputy Ferris asked a direct question in respect of Shannon. This was referenced before by Deputy Wallace. Foreign military aircraft may be permitted to land in the State on condition that they are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering and do not form part of any military exercise or operations. The US is granted blanket permission for overflights by unarmed military aircraft. Civil aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions through Irish airspace and airports unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. I am aware of a recent press release regarding the landing at Shannon Airport of an armed aircraft similar to a type of aircraft which took part in an airstrike. This took place in September 2013. Contrary to notification the aircraft was found to be armed with a fixed weapon and did not, therefore, comply with the normal conditions that apply to foreign military aircraft overflying or landing in Ireland. As the then Tánaiste informed the Dáil on 15 October 2013, this case was raised at the highest possible level with the United States Embassy. The embassy official explained that this isolated incident had taken place as a result of an administrative error. Assurances were given that steps had been taken to prevent any recurrence. I neglected to answer Deputy Martin's direct question about economic and monetary union and banking union. We welcome the focus in the report on completing banking union, backstops, bridge financing and revisiting a common deposit reinsurance scheme. It was regrettable that the reference to a banking union did not feature in the conclusions. However, we will continue to push for this in further discussions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«How much time do I have?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have attempted to address many of the questions raised over the course of the question-and-answer session. Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me whether I accept that the invasion and bombing of Iraq destabilised the whole region. On a personal basis, I do, and the question now is what we do from here on.  I do not think we have seen anything near the peak of this crisis. This is the largest movement of human beings across Europe since the Second World War. In terms of our voice, we raised it within the corridors of power in the EU and will work as a collective within it. I would not want the Deputy to be under any illusion that we do not do that. As a collective we are stronger and our voice within the EU will be heard.  I am conscious that our response stepped up to the mark and went beyond what was expected of Ireland in terms of our acceptance of 4,000 refugees. It focused the attention of other countries which were not doing as much as they should have been doing. I accept that part of the issue in that region is an historic reaction to what happened in the past and that is why we cannot make the same mistakes again.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This crisis will not be solved today, tomorrow, next week or next month. It will be with us for quite a long time. I thank Deputies for their comments and questions. I am pleased to have the opportunity to wrap up the debate on the outcome of the October European Council and touch on some of the issues on the agenda, including some that the Taoiseach did not have time to cover.  Many of the contributions focused on the migration crisis, or the refugee crisis, as it should be more appropriately termed. It is an issue of major concern to everybody in this House and in Ireland. I reiterate a point made by the Taoiseach, namely, that we want a comprehensive EU response based on solidarity which balances a compassionate approach with practical measures. I am pleased to say that Ireland is playing a full part in this response. In addition to our humanitarian assistance, development aid and the provision of naval vessels for search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, the Government agreed on 10 September to establish an Irish refugee protection programme and to accept up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers overall under the EU resettlement and relocation programme. This will not come at any cost to the ongoing issue of addressing the direct provision scandal in Ireland. Anybody living within those centres should not be under the impression that they will be at a disadvantage because of our humanitarian response to the refugee crisis. The report of the direct provision working group is being implemented. A new cross-departmental task force is being established and is working with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme. A network of emergency reception and orientation centres is being established for the initial reception of asylum seekers arriving under the relocation programmes. The Government is also engaging with the public on their generous pledges of support and has tasked the Red Cross with drawing the offers together. A website has been launched to enable members of the public to formally register their pledges. I will move on to a different international issue which the Taoiseach did not have time to touch on. The European Council took note of the publication of the official Dutch report on the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight airline flight MH17 over Ukraine. While there was no detailed discussion at the European Council, Ireland underlined the conclusion to reiterate the EU's commitment to hold to account those responsible for this appalling tragedy. The situation in Ukraine remains one of concern, although there have been signs of some stabilisation recently. While this is to be welcomed, Ireland's position is that all parties must adhere to the terms of the agreement set out in Minsk if there is to be meaningful progress in addressing the conflict. Turning to climate change, the French President updated his colleagues on the conference that will start in Paris on 30 November, bringing together the international community to agree new and enhanced commitments to address climate change. The EU has already set out an ambitious position in advance of this conference, which is known as COP 21. Ireland strongly supports an ambitious, legally binding and global agreement with broad participation as the core outcome of the Paris COP. As part of the EU, Ireland is committed to playing its part in reaching that historic agreement. I note budget 2015 includes a contribution of €2 million to the green climate fund, which represents the first step in Ireland's longer-term financial engagement. This is in addition to our Irish Aid activities which involve working closely with developing partner countries on resilience to climate change and to which we contributed some €33 million last year. I thank Deputies for their questions and contributions and for the attention of the Acting Chairman.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:"extends its sincere condolences and sympathy to the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families on the tragic loss of their loves ones in the Carrickmines fire and offers solidarity and support to the wider Traveller community;agrees that in the aftermath of the Carrickmines tragedy there is an urgent need for a far-reaching and fundamental reappraisal of the position of Travellers in Irish society and that this will require a significant shift in individual and community attitudes to inculcate mutual respect and understanding as between Travellers and the settled community;recognises that:— Travellers experience poorer outcomes in key social indicators including employment, poverty, health, infant mortality, life expectancy, literacy, education and accommodation and face enduring discrimination; and— a further effort by Government Departments, agencies and Traveller organisations at national and local level working in partnership is required to address the root cause of these problems and to bring about greater mutual understanding and respect as between Travellers and the settled community;recalls the recommendations of the April 2014 Report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity;notes that accommodation for Travellers is provided through a range of measures and that it is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation, including:— standard local authority housing, financed from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government capital allocations for social housing;— Traveller-specific accommodation, also financed by the Department;— private housing assisted by the State, including local authorities, or voluntary organisations; and— through Travellers’ own resources;recognises that, while there has been a general decrease in Traveller-specific accommodation funding, some €400 million has been invested in the provision and support of Traveller-specific accommodation over the last 15 years.

I join with Deputies in this House in expressing my condolences to the Connors, Gilbert and Lynch families who lost their lives in Carrickmines. I have been, and have continued to be since my election to this House, an advocate for Traveller ethnicity. I have worked with people on all sides of this House to make Traveller ethnicity a recognised reality. However, my efforts in this regard have been somewhat frustrated because, I am told, I must take account of public opinion. I do not accept the premise that we should deal in the terms of popular opinion when advocating the rights of a minority. Outside of a referendum, I do not believe we should deal in focus group equality or that we should rely on polls in regard to how we should proceed on issues of equality. The fact that advocating for the rights of a minority might be unpopular is surely the reason we should collectively strive to ensure that equality is realised.  As alluded to earlier, since the foundation of this State we have experimented with what may be termed "sameness". Sameness is a lie. Since the foundation of this State people with mental health challenges have been incarcerated. Approximately 200,000 people with mental health issues were incarcerated in the 1950s. Young mothers who were unmarried were told that they were wrong and had to be placed in laundries. People who had troubled backgrounds and behavioural difficulties were also told that they were wrong and had to be sent to industrial schools. As stated so eloquently tonight by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, in 1963 Travellers were told that they were wrong and that they had to become settled people. Sameness is a lie while diversity is the truth. Diversity is the only truth that existed in the past. It is the only truth that can exist now and it is the only truth that can exist in the future. Members of this House, regardless of our political differences, should stand by truth. The truth is that the Traveller community in this State is a distinct ethnic group. They are a people and a part of this nation and they deserve recognition in that regard. This move does not require legislation or a constitutional amendment. It is just as well it does not require a constitutional amendment. One can only imagine the type of debate we would have in this country if that question were put to the people, considering that in this country one can pretty much say in public discourse, polite conversation or print media anything one wants about the Traveller community and get away with it.  There is no more reviled a community in our history, from the settled perspective, than the Traveller community. Is it any wonder that they feel isolated and disconnected? All they are asking for at this point in time is a new platform of interaction with their common citizens in this republic. Michael McDonagh, who is a long term advocate for Traveller rights, has spoken about how young Travellers do not know what role they play or what space they should start from. Surely a positive acknowledgement from this State of what we all know to be true would be the best move we could make. We need to acknowledge the distinct - not separate - culture, heritage, language and tradition of our fellow citizens who are Travellers. From there we can move to a whole new conversation about where we go in the future. We cannot have a commemoration of 1916 next year unless we fully subscribe to the idea of this republic guaranteeing equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens, such that there is no repeat of a situation about which I heard recently, namely, the opening of two books of condolences in public buildings in this country, one of which was signed while the other was rejected. The fact that this measure would not be popular, would not do so well in a poll or might be rejected by a focus group is the very reason we have to support it. Let us reject focus group equality. I am working hard to realise the day when a member of Government, with the support of everybody in this House, can recognise the truth of diversity, put to bed the lie of sameness and say to our Traveller community, which on one level will be an apology for the lives they have led and the discrimination they have had to endure, that from a settled perspective we, this State, this republic, recognises them as a people and wants to work with them to build a new relationship. When that day comes, it will be a proud day for the many people who have campaigned for it, including the Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Women's Forum and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, members of which, cross-party and unanimously, have acknowledged that this has to happen. I believe that will be a proud day for this republic. We could then, collectively, celebrate a new dispensation and a new road to travel together in what would be termed a real republic.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I wanted to share time with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. She regrets that owing to the length of time it took to conclude the previous debate she cannot give her remarks, but she very much supports this move. I am delighted to present this important Bill to the House today. The Bill started life in the Seanad as a Private Members’ Bill under the name of the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2013. Deputies Lyons, Conway and Hannigan, Senator Bacik and I first drafted the Bill and I am delighted to see it reach this stage today. I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of representatives of the INTO LGBT society who have strongly advocated a change in this area for some time. The Government was pleased to support the Private Members’ Bill in principle, bringing forward its own amendments along the way to ensure that the Bill is constitutionally robust, as well as using the opportunity presented to propose certain other changes to equality legislation. These are mainly of a technical nature and required a retitling of the Bill to the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013. The key purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 to better protect employees against discrimination in an appropriate and balanced way, while respecting religious freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. The current section 37(1) of Employment Equality Act 1998 states:A religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of this Part or Part II if— (a) it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee over that person where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or (b) it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.The provision was previously contained in the Employment Equality Bill 1996 which was referred by the then President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held that Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance that better meets the rights of employees, the logic of the Supreme Court decision is that balance needs to be struck; it is not simply a matter of repealing or deleting section 37(1) in its entirety. This would require an amendment to the Constitution, affirmed by the people in a popular vote. However, recognising that this was a pressing issue and that there was a chilling effect on employees in the teaching and medical professions, the programme for Government committed to amending section 37(1) to ensure that its operation leads to a fairer and more equitable balance as between the rights of freedom of religion or association, on the one hand, and the right of persons in employment, or prospective employees, to be free from discrimination and to privacy in their private lives, on the other. A key feature of the amended Bill as passed by the Seanad is the distinction drawn between religious institutions that are entirely privately funded and those which are funded by the taxpayer. The rationale is that in the case of the second category, the Government has the right, and arguably a duty, to protect employees who are paid from public moneys from unfair treatment or discrimination in their workplace. The proposal in the Bill before us today will oblige relevant employers in religious-run schools and hospitals to show that any favourable treatment of an employee or prospective employee is limited to the religion ground and action taken against a person is objectively justified by reference to that institution’s aim of protecting its religious ethos and that the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. The proposed new subsection will provide that action taken against an employee or prospective employee on the religion ground shall not be regarded as justified unless it is rationally and strictly related to the institution’s religious ethos; a response to conduct of a person which undermines or would undermine the religious ethos of the institution, rather than being a response to that person’s status under any of the other discrimination grounds, for example sexual orientation, set out in equality legislation; and proportionate to the conduct of the employee or prospective employee, having regard to alternative action the employer could take, the consequences of any action taken for the employee or prospective employee and the actual damage caused to the religious ethos of the institution. The aim is to raise the bar so that religious-run schools and hospitals will have to show real damage to their ethos, are precluded from discrimination on any of the other equality grounds, and that any action taken is reasonable and proportionate. This amendment might seem like a minor change in our law but it will bring a huge sigh of relief to the people whom it affects. Throughout our recent marriage equality referendum campaign, I met teachers who could not talk about their private lives with their colleagues in work. This was not because their colleagues did not accept them, but because they feared the repercussions of being open about their relationship status or sexual orientation. In 2015 this is absolutely unacceptable which is why I am bringing these much-needed changes before the House today. I am also using the opportunity afforded by the Bill to advance a number of other, mainly technical, amendments to existing equality legislation. The most significant of these is to prohibit discrimination in the letting of residential accommodation on the basis that a person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement or housing assistance payment. It will eliminate the inclusion by some landlords of references to rent supplement not being accepted in advertisements of residential rented property. This will involve an amendment to sections 2 and 6 of the Equal Status Act 2000. The Bill also proposes to amend the definitions of indirect discrimination in the Equality Acts to follow precisely the definitions in the relevant EU directives and their evolving interpretation by the Court of Justice of the European Union.Therefore, amendments are proposed to the definitions of indirect discrimination in the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Act 2000 and the Pensions Act 1990 to bring the letter of the legislation into line with those directives. While the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discriminatory advertisements, there is no provision to allow an aggrieved party in relation to an employment opportunity to take a case to the Workplace Relations Commission other than a referral by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. The Bill intends to remedy the deficiency by allowing the person himself or herself take a complaint, as distinct from allowing cases to be taken solely by the IHREC. That will involve amendments to sections 2, 8(5), 12 and 13 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. While the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004 based on the wording in the directive, the case law of the European Court of Justice has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific provisions of the directive. The European Court of Justice has also held that the provision of fixed-term contracts on the basis of age constitutes age discrimination and would require justification under Article 6 of the directive. The amendments I propose in the Bill will bring domestic legislation more into line with those judgments. The amendments required are to sections 6 and 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The State is obliged under the European Economic Area agreement and the EU-Swiss agreements to ensure that benefits in regard to admission to any course of vocational training offered by an educational or training body is extended to EU nationals and is also extended to EEA and Swiss nationals, in the absence of an explicit provision to the contrary in these agreements. In practice, the same benefits in regard to such fees and admission are afforded to EEA and Swiss nationals, but the equality legislation does not refer to Swiss and EEA nationals and needs to be amended to explicitly reference them. In this regard, amendments are required to section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and to section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000. I look forward to engaging further with Deputies from all sides of the House on Committee Stage to ensure the Bill is passed and enacted in the shortest timeframe possible.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The Minister for Justice and Equality and I are appreciative of the co-operative spirit that has attended the passage of this Bill in the House. It has been noted on several occasions that this is essentially a technical Bill which will ensure we fulfil our EU obligations with the choice of court convention. It will be recalled that the convention provides a framework for upholding choice of court clauses. It is hoped that the competence which will build on such clauses will promote their wider use. International trade needs legal certainty and predictability, if it is to flourish. In a small way, the convention has the potential to contribute towards the realisation of these important objectives. The EU has led by example in ceding to the convention in June of this year. It is hoped other countries will follow that example of the next few years. I thank Deputies for their assistance in facilitating the Bill’s passage through the house.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That Report Stage be taken now."
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the House for the support that all parties have given to this Bill. As the tragic events in Paris last week have starkly illustrated, international co-operation and mutual assistance between police authorities in member states and outside of the EU is becoming increasingly important. Criminals and terrorists do not operate within the boundaries of any international borders and it is absolutely essential that measures to tackle criminality and terrorism also operate across these borders. This Bill amends the existing Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act of 2008. That Act already gives effect to 12 international agreements which establish the existing legislative framework relating to the provision of mutual legal assistance. This Bill is necessary in order to give effect to a further six international agreements not yet provided for in the 2008 Act. These are international instruments which have already been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill provides for a number of enhancements to existing legislation. It provides for Ireland to provide assistance to other member states in the form of special intervention units to assist another state, on request, in dealing with crisis situations that present a serious and direct physical threat such as terrorist incidents. Assistance can take the form of the provision of equipment, expertise or direct assistance in the territory of the requesting member state, if requested. Any specialist units would operate under the responsibility, authority and direction of the requesting member state but would only be able to operate within the limits of their own national powers. As the recent tragic events in Paris have shown, we cannot know whether we may be asked in the future by another state to provide such assistance and it is important to have a legal basis in place to enable us to respond to such requests.  The Bill also provides for the strengthening of the role of Eurojust in exchanging intelligence information about criminality in the EU. Eurojust is an EU agency based in The Hague dealing with judicial co-operation in criminal matters. The Bill will also allow fines imposed by courts in one member state to be collected in another member state where the person concerned resides in or is a citizen of that state. This provision will apply to any fine imposed which is appealable to a criminal court.  I thank Deputies for their support for this Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputies from all sides for their valuable contributions on this Second Stage debate and for the broad support they have given to the principle of equality for all workers, particularly teachers and other workers who feel threatened by the current provision of section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. Deputies referred to the devastating effects of discrimination and homophobia, and studies highlighting higher rates of depression and self-harm among the LGBT community have, sadly, underlined these effects all too clearly. These, and other examples mentioned by Deputies, show the extent of the problem and the urgency of having amending legislation in place as soon as possible. It was for this reason that the Government, in the programme for Government, undertook to amend section 37(1) to provide for a more equitable balance between the rights and freedoms of religion and religious institutions on the one hand and the right to be free from discrimination on the other. The aim of the Bill is to provide clear guidance on resolving disputes that may arise between employees and employers. While it will always remain the case that an employer has the right to take action against an employee who acts against the employer's best interests, or undermines the institution's ethos, there will now be criteria against which to determine the reasonableness and proportionality of any action taken. The Bill requires that employers who provide publicly funded services should meet a higher standard of justification for any action taken against an employee on grounds of undermining the institution's religious ethos. The Bill thus distinguishes between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes and those providing a social, educational or medical service to the public financed by State funding. This important distinguishing feature must be recognised in any amending legislation in order to ensure its constitutionality. I understand the frustration of some Deputies that the Bill does not go far enough and their desire that section 37(1) be repealed. However, there is a constitutional balance to be struck in reconciling the competing constitutional rights involved, namely, on the one hand, freedom of religion and freedom of association for religious bodies and their freedom to establish and maintain their own institutions, and on the other hand, the right of employees to be free from discrimination. To present it in a positive way, the legal advice available is that the State has a stronger standing, the right and, arguably, the duty to ensure people whose salaries are paid directly or indirectly from the public Exchequer are protected and that in such circumstances a stronger intervention in the employee-employer relationship than would be appropriate in purely religious institutions is justified. The fundamental point with which we are grappling is that religious institutions do, and must, have the constitutional right to differentiate, which is the sense in which discrimination is used in EU law and our domestic legislation, on the basis of religion or belief. We can say there must be a rationale for favourable treatment and any action taken must be fully justified. We can raise the bar to a very high level where public funding is involved. However, we cannot prohibit religious institutions from differentiating on the basis of religion. Otherwise, the legislation when passed will be liable to successful challenge in the courts. The Bill should be seen in the context of what the Government has achieved for LGBT people. We have introduced compulsory anti-bullying procedures in all schools explicitly referring to homophobic and transphobic bullying for the first time. We recently enacted progressive gender recognition legislation, making us one of the most progressive countries in the world for transgender rights. This week, we gave effect to the results of the marriage equality referendum last May through the commencement of the Marriage Act 2015. Ending discrimination in our schools and hospitals is the next major step in the programme of reform. I look forward to engaging further with Deputies on the technical aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next Wednesday.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue for discussion today. Nationally, inpatient child and adolescent bed capacity has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 58 beds at present, with 26 beds in Dublin, 12 beds in Cork and 20 beds in Galway. This represents an almost fivefold increase over eight years. I am pleased to announce that a new purpose-built 22-bed child and adolescent inpatient unit located on the grounds of Cherry Orchard Hospital has been completed and will be opened next week by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. The existing 14 beds in the current temporary facility will transfer across to the new facility. This means that there will be an additional eight child and adolescent mental health beds in the country and that the total number of beds will increase to 66. Those who provide child and adolescent mental health services in the mid-west region, which covers Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, have access as required to a modern state-of-the-art inpatient child and adolescent mental health facility in Galway. Requests for admissions to this facility are made by the local child and adolescent mental health teams in the mid-west to their counterparts in Galway. All applications are appropriately considered and prioritised. The HSE is committed to the appropriate provision of child and adolescent mental health service inpatient beds for children. From time to time, a young person may have a very short admission to an adult facility pending the availability of a bed in a child and adolescent unit. These placements are generally for very short periods. Progress in this area is underscored by the fact that such admissions have declined from 247 in 2008 to 89 last year. It is important to stress that the HSE's intention is to aim for appropriate placements and to reduce to the greatest extent possible the need for and dependency on inpatient beds. Modern-day multidisciplinary interventions for children are much more appropriate to non-inpatient admissions and to supporting children in their own family settings. In the mid-west region, a consultant-led child and adolescent mental health service is provided by multidisciplinary teams across Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary. This service operates an emergency service for critical cases of same-day referral. In addition, an out-of-hours on-call service is provided through the emergency department of the University Hospital Limerick. This is not replicated in all parts of the country. The child and adolescent mental health service based in Limerick is scheduled to move to a new outpatient and clinical premises shortly, subject to the completion of some final details in respect of the property involved. Plans are being advanced to explore the possibility of providing the equivalent of a day hospital-type service. This will further enhance the capacity of the services within the region. The Deputy will appreciate the priority shown by this Government to modernise mental health policy and services in line with A Vision for Change. He will also be aware that significant new resources have been allocated for mental health since 2012.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy makes a solid case. He has acknowledged the movements and the improvements that have been made in this area, as borne out by the statistics I provided to him in my initial reply. I do not have an answer at the moment to the very direct question he has asked. I will ensure the Department makes direct contact with him and supplies him in writing with the information he has sought in the question he has asked this evening.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible under statute for the six designated fishery harbour centres which are located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveel and Killybegs. All six fishery centres are, first and foremost, working fishery harbours which provide essential services and facilities to the fishing industry around the coastline. Each fishery harbour centre has unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities which are important from both an economic and social perspective. The Department is conscious of the importance of both fishing and non-fishing activities at the harbours. This involves day-to-day operational support by harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure, subject to available financial resources. I am pleased to advise the House that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of €4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth as part of the Department's fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme between 2011 and 2014. The Minister also approved funding of €1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth fishery harbour centre in 2015. Major works for 2015 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of a small craft pontoon and traffic management works. Siltation in Howth harbour is recognised as an issue and is being kept under review. It has been discussed with various stakeholders, and officials from the Department attended the Howth Harbour Users Forum on 29 January 2015 and used the occasion to have a number of tangential meetings with users, at which the issue of dredging was discussed. A further meeting with the Howth Yacht Club was held on 17 July at which the question of dredging was again the main item of discussion. As part of the 2015 fishery harbour centre development programme, the Minister sanctioned €150,000 to carry out site investigation works in Howth for the west pier pontoon and middle pier upgrade. The site investigation contractor commenced work on site in early November and the work is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the year. It is anticipated that the report on the site investigation will be issued in early 2016. This report will include information on the nature of the material to be dredged and the extent of contaminated material within the dredge footprint. This information is required to prepare a dumping at sea licence application which will be necessary for the commencement of any dredging project in future. It will also provide the basis for an informed estimate of the cost of dredging the harbour at Howth. As with all other developments in the six fishery harbour centres, a dredging project at Howth fishery harbour centre will be considered under future capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing priorities. The suite of projects for inclusion in the 2016 programme is being considered and the Minister will make an announcement on these in due course.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is an important issue and I agree with many of the points the Deputy has made. On the publication of the report early next year, local Deputies and interested parties may be in a position to meet with the Minister. I will do my best to facilitate that, as it would be the best way to proceed. I will ask the Minister about the capital allocation and see if he can move the issue forward. Howth Harbour is a wonderful amenity, and the issues the Deputy raised are extremely important. We must be in a position to act on them and proceed in an appropriate manner once the report is available. It should be published, available and transparent and we should be able to act on it as soon as it is there. Deputy Broughan and I can facilitate a meeting with the Minister to ensure that we can act on it.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The Government, as the Deputy knows, published a roadmap to Ireland’s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 21 October 2015. The roadmap details the legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the convention, along with the estimated timeframe involved and a clear and unambiguous deadline for ratification by the end of 2016. As announced, the Government has inter alia approved the drafting of the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to make a range of miscellaneous amendments to statute law necessary to enable ratification. Work on the general scheme of this Bill is underway, with a view to submission to Government very soon. The Deputy will also be aware that we recently published a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and that we are at phase 2 of a three phase consultation process that will lead early in the New Year to the adoption of a new disability inclusion strategy. I am committed to continuous improvement where equality and human rights are concerned and the development of this new strategy is an opportunity to bring about real improvements for people with disabilities.  While clearly there is a substantial legislative agenda across a number of Departments to get through, as set out in the roadmap, and a lot of work to be done to prepare a new inclusion strategy that can have a real and measurable impact, I can assure Deputy Mac Lochlainn and the House that we have the drive and enthusiasm to get it done. I am glad that ratification of the convention is a common goal. All political parties support ratification and I am pleased that the Deputy put this issue on the agenda for discussion today. Civil society groups and stakeholders are also keen to see the convention ratified. Equality is about creating the circumstances that ensure that every individual has equal access to the enjoyment of their rights, with employment playing a central role in that regard. We will maintain the momentum on ratification of the convention, as set out in the roadmap, to make sure that the rights of all persons with disabilities will be protected in our laws.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I assure the Deputy that nobody is having a word in anyone's ear urging caution. The reality is that Ireland takes a different approach to these matters. There are many countries around the world which will ratify this convention but it will have no meaningful effect. Ireland does these things differently.This means that effectively when Ireland ratifies a convention it has material effect. Other countries can ratify it but it is a meaningless statement. Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and is one of three EU member states yet to ratify. I agree it has taken too long and have no difficulty in accepting that, but different countries take different approaches. We take our international obligations very seriously and we do not ratify until we can guarantee compliance. We sign conventions as a declaration of our commitment that we want to apply the convention concerned in Ireland but we ratify when we can guarantee to our international partners that we are meeting our commitments. We could ratify in the morning, but we still have a number of steps yet to take. Under the Constitution, the conduct of international affairs is the responsibility of Government, and this includes ratification of international conventions. However, the sole prerogative of legislating for the State is vested in the Oireachtas. This is also reflected in Article 29.6 of the Constitution, which states that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State, save as may be determined by the Oireachtas. That is how we do things in Ireland. When we ratify, it has meaningful import.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can confirm the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will be enacted by the end of the year. While I take the Deputy's point about the ratification of the convention, I have stated the reasons that Ireland has a different approach to other countries. In terms of the equality agenda, in every area I and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, deal with, from LGBT rights to people with disabilities, to Travellers and to migrant issues, employment always comes up as a central issue for all people on the edge of society who want to get involved in the mainstream. In particular, this includes dignity at work, access to the labour market and protection within work. That is why the comprehensive employment strategy was key to the Government's work in this area. If a person has a disability that does not restrict them from entering the workforce, or if a person is in the workforce and acquires a disability, the person can be a part of the workforce. We feel passionately about that, which is why we place so much emphasis on it. That is a key part of this Government's commitment to people with disabilities and will continue to be so.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputies Joe Costello and Maureen O'Sullivan for raising this issue. This morning I accompanied Mr. Tony Duffin and other members of the Ana Liffey Drug Project on a walk through the streets north and south of the River Liffey for an hour and a half.What I came across was particularly shocking. I saw drug paraphernalia, human excrement, the result of a drug user's withdrawal symptoms, blood and various other types of drug litter. What I witnessed today is still very much playing on my mind. I had been on a walk-around previously with Mr. Duffin and was very much taken aback then. I was taken aback again today by what I had witnessed. I will give the official response and we can then discuss the issue in more detail. I thank the Deputies for raising the issue of the recognised problem of street injecting in Ireland. The establishment of supervised injecting centres has been proposed by the Ana Liffey drugs project. Such centres are essentially drug consumption rooms where drug injection is facilitated in a clinical setting under the supervision of nurses and counsellors. Service users are supplied with clean injecting kits and health care professionals are on hand to make an intervention in the event of a drug overdose. These centres save lives.  Supervised injecting centres seek to attract hard-to-reach populations of chronic injecting drug users. They are particularly effective in reaching out to marginalised groups, namely, those who use drugs on the street or in other risky and unhygienic conditions and those who have remained out of reach of or who are resistant to higher threshold services.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I have reviewed the evidence on supervised injecting centres and intend to submit a formal proposal to the Government before Christmas. The aim of any supervised injecting centre is to reduce the incidence of public street injecting and the negative impact it has on those who inject, in terms of their dignity, health and ability to access health and social care services, as well as on the wider community and public service providers such as gardaí and ambulance personnel. The aim is also to reduce the number of drug-related deaths resulting directly from overdoses. No decision has yet been made on the number or location of such facilities. I intend to include additional heads in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to provide for supervised injecting centres. Drafting of the Bill is under way in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill will restore the Government's powers to make regulations to control new drugs. As Deputies will know, these powers were curtailed by the Court of Appeal judgment earlier this year. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in early 2016 and provide for a legislative unblocking of any impediment to the introduction of medically supervised injecting centres. I agree with Deputy Joe Costello when he says this is not a panacea. It is not the only response available to us. There are lots of overlapping concerns, including homelessness, isolation, marginalisation and disadvantage. A humane response to the issue of street injecting is to take the small cohort of very vulnerable drug users who are outside any mainstream drug programme off the streets, away from corners, bus shelters, parks and playgrounds and provide them with a safe, secure and compassionate setting where they can inject, as they will do anyway. The aim is to curtail the possibility of their contracting HIV or hepatitis C and to save lives. Nobody anywhere in the world who has injected in a medically supervised injecting centre has died of an overdose. There are 88 such centres across Europe and several in Australia and other parts of the world and they work very effectively. I expect the legislation to be introduced in the House early next year, after which we will have to talk about management, the way any such centre would be organised, where they would be located and the funding mechanisms which would have to be put in place to run them effectively. I envisage one centre being opened in Dublin city centre initially, but representations are being made to my office to have supervised injecting centres opened in other urban centres, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputies for their support. I thank all Members of Dáil Éireann for supporting this initiative. A memo has been sent to all Departments seeking their observations which should be with us by 15 December. Upon their receipt, we will proceed with inserting the relevant section into the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill which will be presented to the House in the new year. What I saw this morning shocked me. I saw syringes discarded dangerously on the steps of the Customs House and in alleyways. I also saw blood and human excrement. This is our city and the people concerned are citizens of this Republic who are, for their own reasons and because of their vulnerability, forced into a situation where they feel they have no option but to access an area behind a dumpster to engage in this activity. We have to look at this issue from the perspective of the entire community and within it drug users who need dignity and a safe, compassionate place where they can inject heroin in a controlled way in order to take the first step on the road to recovery, safe from contracting HIV or hepatitis C and from the danger of taking an overdose. It is a compassionate response which will be welcomed by the citizens of Dublin and Ireland who are nervous about the unsightly nature of open injecting. The retailers of Dublin city are also pushing for this measure. I do not agree with the suggestion that there should be a mobile clinic because there is a better chance of developing a long-term relationship with a facility if it is located in one fixed spot. However, that is a discussion we must have after the legislation has been passed. Once the Bill has been enacted, we can get into discussions about regulation, funding, control and consultation.  I thank the Deputies for their support and hope to see an historic new section in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in the new year which will provide for an injecting centre in Dublin initially and perhaps, in the coming years, in other parts of the country.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputies for their contributions, many of which I have much support for and some of which were a little bit off tone. Several years ago, Deputies Ciara Conway, Dominic Hannigan and John Lyons, Senator Ivana Bacik and I came together to draft legislation to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Over several years, painstakingly, through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Attorney General, with amendments and counter-amendments and discussion from all sides of the Houses, we have come to the position today where we can amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 to remove the chilling effect for people who work in religious-run State institutions which are-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is not my intention.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is absolutely not my intention.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Deputy Shortall took half an hour for her contribution and I find her recent conversion to a liberal Ireland quite fascinating.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The point is on the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the amendment itself, the point is that this is the vehicle which we are trying to achieve tonight. What has been brought into this vehicle of amending legislation is an issue concerning the Equality Act. I have a huge amount of sympathy with the points made and what campaigners such as Paddy Monahan, John Suttle and others, who I have been dealing with and speaking to over a number of years, are doing, but there are technical reasons this amendment cannot be accepted.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not my intention in any way to talk down any clock. I am trying to give the House the time and the decency of the explanation that has been prepared to have a decent and proper understanding of what we are trying to achieve. As an aside, as someone who has been the focal point of heavy criticism in Catholic, right-wing and conservative newspapers and who has been shouted about and criticised from pulpits in churches across the land, I find it remarkable that somehow my or my Department's analysis of this legislation is considered to be coming from a conservative viewpoint. I ask the Deputies to allow me the time to give a constitutional angle and the technical reasons for our arguments.  The objective of the amendment is to provide for the repeal of the current section 7(3)(c) in its entirety. Section 7 generally prohibits discrimination in respect of the admission policy operated by an educational establishment except where it is a primary or post-primary school operating in an environment which promotes certain religious values. In such circumstances, under subsection 7(3)(c) the school may favour the enrolment of students from a particular religious denomination in preference to others or refuse to admit a student who is not of that denomination. However, any preferential admission policy in this regard is only permitted to the extent it is essential to maintaining the religious ethos of the particular school.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The provision reflects the freedom of religion guaranteed in Article 44 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Superior Courts and, in particular, the right of every religious denomination to manage its own affairs and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes. I am advised that deleting this provision would infringe that freedom of religion for religiously run institutions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The broader issue of school admission policies and the creation of greater choice for parents who do not want a religious education for their children is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills. As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, is addressing these issues in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----and that is where the issues surrounding school admission policies will be addressed as well as by creating real choice for parents through putting a wider variety of schools in place. For that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can give a further explanation if required by Deputies.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It will take a number of moments but Deputies may accuse me of running down the clock.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was argued in the Article 26 referral hearing of the Employment Equality Bill 1996 that what became section 31 contravened the guarantees of freedom of conscience and free profession and practice of religion contained in Article 44.2.1°-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----and that it contravened the ban on imposing any disabilities or making any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status. Effectively, not to delay the issue further, the point is that a constitutional issue is at play here. It is not in any way our intention to have a situation persist where children are precluded from attending their local school. It is my firm belief and personal view that the issue at the heart of the education system is that it is one which is dominated by patronage and not child-centred.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«However, that is not an issue for this Bill. This Bill is purely to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----and other sections to ensure that the chilling effect on members of the LGBT community, divorcees and single parents who work in our schools and hospitals under religious patronage can be eliminated. I am proud of this Bill-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----having spent four years of my career-----

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----bringing it to to the eventuality it will become tonight.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«At 9 p.m., that chilling effect ends.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. a1:In page 7, after line 29, to insert the following:“(3) An order under subsection (2) may, in respect of the repeal of the Act specified in section 6(1) effected by that section, appoint different days for the repeal of different provisions of that Act.”. I will now deal with amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 1:In page 8, to delete lines 6 to 10 and substitute the following: “ “applicant” means a person who—(a) has made an application for international protection in accordance with section 15, or on whose behalf such an application has been made or is deemed to have been made, and(b) has not ceased, under subsection (2), to be an applicant;”.This grouping of amendments relates to the definition of various terms for the purpose of this Act. Amendment No. 1 is a minor amendment to the definition of the term "applicant". Amendment No. 2 provides a definition of the term "biometric information", which is referenced in section 2. Amendment No. 4 provides a definition for the term "DNA profile" which is referenced in section 2.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 2:In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“ “biometric information” means information relating to the distinctive physical characteristics of a person including—(a) measurements or other assessments of those characteristics,(b) information about those characteristics held in an automated form, but does not include references to the DNA profile of a person, and references to the provision by a person of biometric information means its provision in a way that enables the identity of the person to be investigated or ascertained;”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 3:In page 8, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“ “chief international protection officer” means the person appointed under section 74 to be the chief international protection officer;”.Amendment No. 3 provides a definition of a chief international protection officer who will be responsible for the management of the international protection office which will be established in the Department of Justice and Equality. Amendment No. 5 provides a definition for the term "international protection officer". Amendment No. 177 inserts a new section into the Bill on international protection officers. This section provides inter alia that these officers shall be independent in the performance of their functions under the Act. Amendment No. 178 inserts a new section into the Bill on the chief international protection officer. It provides for the appointment of the chief international protection officer by the Minister and that this person shall be independent in the performance of their functions under the Act.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have heard various descriptions of the Bill and the tone of this debate brings more emotive language to the discussion of this Bill, which is completely unnecessary. Why would the Minister for Justice and Equality appoint somebody who is completely unfit for the job? This individual will come from the Civil Service and will meet UNHCR standards. The overall point of the Bill, which the Deputy alluded to, is to ensure that people do not languish in the protection system for years on end, which is the overarching problem identified by every NGO I have come in contact with concerning the protection system in Ireland. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that applicants for protection in this country will get a decision on their application within six months and finality on that decision within 12 months. There will not be a situation in which they languish in the system, many in direct provision, for a long number of years. That is the point of the Bill. The international protection officer will be a person of the highest standard who will exercise his or her duties fairly and independently.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am fascinated by the terminology used by the Deputy, including that this legislation is being rammed through the House. It has been around for approximately 15 years-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----the result of which is that this issue has not been addressed. Every NGO of which I am aware has been calling for a long time for the introduction of a single procedure mechanism. The Deputy will be aware that the expiry of the term of office of the Government is approaching. It is important in the context of the current protection process in Ireland that we put this issue to bed and put in place a single procedure to ensure the system will be more transparent and efficient. The current system is not fit for purpose. On the Deputy's reference to the lack of a definition of international protection officers, the purpose of these amendments is to define their role. They will be civil servants trained to UNHCR standard. The point of the exercise is to ensure improvement of the system. I am sure the Deputy will agree that, owing to a lack of reform of the current asylum system for many years, it is broken. What we are attempting to do by way of this process is review and assess it in a humane and proper fashion, understanding all the while that even since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for this area and the appointment of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to her portfolio, the situation has changed radically in terms of the number of people coming to Ireland to seek protection, including those who are coming here because of the situation internationally. Be that as it may, the objective is to put in place a protection process to deal with individuals with dignity and respect and to ensure their applications will be processed in a fair and independent manner.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are only so many times I can repeat the same point. All international protection officers will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard. The suggestion that what is being proposed will lead to the outsourcing of these roles is tiresome. That is not the case. IPOs will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard and will exercise their role independently.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy is correct that it is not specified in the Bill. The staff of the international protection office will be civil servants transferred from the Refugee Application Service to take up this role. They will be civil servants who, as I said, will be trained to UNHCR standard. I assume what the Deputies opposite are suggesting is the highest possible standards in the processing of applications might not be adhered to. We must have a system in which people can have faith. In this regard, there are international standards we have to uphold. As a country, we must ensure our international process is in line with that in place in every other European country. Our protection process in recent years has not been one of which we can be proud. Part of the reason for this is legislation of this type has not been given priority for more than 15 years. We are now in a position where we can address this issue appropriately. I assure Deputies that international protection officers will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard and that we will deal with applications on that basis.The asylum status is a fundamental international status and the UNHCR is strong in its opinion that it should retain that international status for many different reasons. The Bill will proceed on that basis. The suggestion about outsourcing and privatisation does not stand up to scrutiny. These will be civil servants trained to the highest UNHCR standards. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is implicit in section 73 that international protection officers will be civil servants. The Minister is not empowered to authorise anyone who is not a civil servant. Section 73 provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions". The Minister cannot authorise anyone who is not a civil servant. Only a civil servant can perform this function. While it may not be explicit, it is certainly implicit in the section. I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. I appreciate the comments made about my bona fides. We are attempting to improve the Bill and we are accepting many of the amendments tabled by the Opposition in order to make it better. There is no intention here but to do the best for those vulnerable people who seek our protection and have a system that works better. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Section 73.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have already outlined that the Minister can only authorise civil servants to carry out these functions. He or she cannot authorise anyone else. It is implicit in the text.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am on page 27, section 73.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In terms of the amendments, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on international protection officers by or under this Act". These people can only be civil servants.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am working off the list of amendments. The central point is that section 73(1) provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on an international protection officer". The Minister cannot authorise just anyone to fulfil this role. This is implicit. No Minister in any circumstance can authorise anyone within his or her Department who is not a civil servant. That is the reality of the situation. It is implicit in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There will be people who will make the decision. There will be people who will assist the individual in terms of the operation of the office but the international protection officer who makes the decision will be authorised by the Minister and that person must be a civil servant.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«These are Government amendments-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are dealing with a group of amendments relating to the functions of the international protection officer. The issue arising relates to the outsourcing or privatisation of this service. What I am trying to outline to the Deputies opposite is that implicit in the Bill is that such individuals will be civil servants, as appointed by the Minister and the Minister cannot do otherwise. That is in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 4:In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:“ “DNA profile” has the meaning it has in section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014;”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 5:In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:““international protection officer” means a person who is authorised under section 73 to perform the functions conferred on an international protection officer by or under this Act;”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As with all other amendments, I appreciate the attempt being made to improve the Bill and safeguard the best interests of those who are seeking protection in Ireland, particularly children. Before we entered into this process, the term "best interests of the child" was mentioned three times in the Bill. If we conclude today's proceedings successfully, the term will be mentioned in the Bill seven times as a result of the interaction we have had with Opposition Deputies who have been trying to improve it by tabling positive amendments. A lot of it comes down to terminology which is consistent with EU directives. The term “separated child” is not defined in the EU directives to which the Bill seeks to give effect. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the proposed amendment as the term does not need to be defined and is not one used in the text of the Bill. All children who arrive in the State will be protected by the provisions of the Bill, with the best interests of the child taken being the primary consideration.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have to keep in line with international terminology and EU directives. I repeat that the term is not defined in EU directives and our legislation has to keep in line with such EU directives. I appreciate that the Deputy is attempting to improve the Bill in the best interests of children.Following our deliberations, the best interest of the child will be implicit and explicit throughout the Bill, which many would suggest would not have happened if it was not for Opposition and Government amendments. In this particular situation, we are dealing with terminology and the proposed term is not defined in the new directives.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate what the Deputy is saying. We all want to be in a position to support a single procedure mechanism. I have no difficulty with taking soundings from NGOs and am aware of their concerns. However, the Government is entitled to disagree. Our amendments and the advice we have received from the Attorney General and officials must also be considered. A number of voices must be taken into consideration. In terms of the specific amendment and the term "stateless person", we must keep in line with international law and EU directives. I cannot accept the proposed amendment as the term is not defined in EU directives. If the term is not defined, it is not a term we can entertain. It is not defined in the EU directives that this Bill gives effect to.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 8:In page 11, to delete lines 5 to 26 and substitute the following:“(2) A person shall cease to be an applicant on the date on which—(a) subject to subsection (3), the Minister refuses—(i) under subsection (2) or (3) of section 46 to give the person a refugee declaration, or(ii) under section 46(5) both to give a refugee declaration and to give a subsidiary protection declaration to the person,(b) subject to subsection (3), he or she is first given, under section 53(1), a permission to reside in the State, or(c) he or she is transferred from the State in accordance with the Dublin Regulation.(3) Where—(a) a recommendation referred to in section 38(3)(b) is made in respect of an applicant, and(b) the applicant appeals under section 40(1)(a) against the recommendation,notwithstanding the giving, under section 46(4)(a), of a subsidiary protection declaration to the applicant on the basis of the recommendation, he or she shall, for the purposes of this Act, remain an applicant until, following the decision of the Tribunal in relation to the appeal, the Minister, under section 46, gives or, as the case may be, refuses to give him or her a refugee declaration.”.This amendment provides further clarity on when a person ceases to be an applicant under the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are dealing with two separate issues if we are talking about the Bill and the direct provision system. Approximately half of the people here seeking asylum are in direct provision and half are not. There are approximately 4,500 people in direct provision and a similar number are not. Members know the working group was established 18 months ago and it reported earlier this year. A number of those recommendations are being worked on. It is the only document in town when it comes to direct provision and nothing else is being entertained. It is the document that the Government is working from and many of the recommendations are in this Bill. Other recommendations, such as those relating to the right to work provision mentioned by the Deputy, are currently being assessed by the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy. I have visited approximately 14 centres around the country. The overarching and main issue that is constantly being raised is the length of time in the system. It does not matter what kind of wonderful conditions that anybody could possibly put in place for people seeking protection as they just want out. It is not a place to live for a long period or, certainly, to raise a family. We do not accept the amendment because this is a different issue from what is being dealt with in the Bill. Since the publication of the report between 60 and 80 people per month who have lived in the direct provision system over five years have been getting leave to remain. The report's recommendations are being implemented, even in this Bill. We have seen over 80 deportation orders quashed since July. Other recommendations are yet to be effected. If we get to a stage where every asylum application is assessed within six months, it would logically follow that asylum seekers could access the labour market and other entitlements. When direct provision was first established, it was a response to a homelessness issue. There were 10,000 applications per year in the early 2000s and people were living in parks and playgrounds, sleeping on benches because there was nowhere for them to live. It was a homelessness crisis in the asylum system. The direct provision system was established with the intention that applicants would be there for a number of months. I could stand over a system where people would live in a facility for a number of months but I cannot stand over a system that belittles people because they are there for years on end. That is why we put together a working group to consider the entire process, including direct provision. It did not advocate an amnesty but rather that anybody in the system for over five years should see a fast-track approach in their application. That is exactly what is happening and I have mentioned the figures already. This is for new applicants and to deal with them in a fairer and more transparent fashion so that they do not have to languish in a protection system for years on end. This is so we do not have the scandalous position of families living in and children being born in centres, living there for nine, ten or 11 years and knowing nothing else but the walls of a direct provision centre. We are trying to effect reform to deal with the backlog of applications in the system. For the information of the Deputies opposite, approximately 450 people in direct provision have leave to remain but have nowhere to go because of housing issues. I have had to take on the responsibility of chairing a task force, examining the information and empowering people to be able to access accommodation, dealing with local authorities and housing agencies to ensure that families can get out of direct provision into accommodation to rebuild their lives. They have an absolute right to do that. We are working with them. The worst thing we could do to a family is say that they have leave to remain and show them the door. We have not done that. There are approximately 18 cases of people who have been in direct provision for more than a year after they get leave to remain status. I understand and admire the Deputies' intent and campaigning zeal on the issue. We have worked together on this issue, as we have with many Deputies opposite. The intent of this Bill is to have a process that is much more humane and transparent, so as to deal with the issue much more quickly than the current system. Direct provision is a separate issue that is being dealt with through the report, which has been signed off by many non-governmental organisations in the field. Its recommendations are being implemented as I speak.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Deputy for his contribution. There were three references to the best interests of the child in the first draft of the Bill but because of amendments such as this, on the passage of the Bill, there will be at least seven references. I do not accept the Deputy's amendment and I will outline the reasons shortly. The Bill will be better as a result of the contributions from across the House. We do not oppose the motivations behind the amendment but, unfortunately, we are dealing with technical wording that appears in legislation. The working group on the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, held a similar view and one whose intent I share. However, the working group did not consider the potential impact on other areas of this Bill, including the fact it refers to the protection process and certain immigration provisions. Following extensive legal advice, I am satisfied the provisions in the legislation and our amendments ensure not only the intent of the recommendations but also fulfil the Government's policy to enable such protection to be included in our Constitution, as the Deputy has mentioned. The amendment does not legally satisfy the advice we have been given and would have an unintended consequence beyond the scope intended that we cannot resolve at this stage. We have explored all avenues to reassure all those who rightly advocate for children's rights that the Bill will ensure the best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the protection process, ensuring the best practice, which exists in our process, will be embedded in the practices that will result from the enactment of the Bill. A number of amendments have been tabled by the Government which will further strengthen the safeguards for children in the legislation. A provision has been inserted in section 15(4) to provide for the Child and Family Agency to include legal advice when deciding if an application should be made in respect of an unaccompanied minor. We also propose an amendment to section 27 along with an amendment to section 25. These were prompted following serious engagement with Senator van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance. Amendment No. 74 also addresses this matter. The amendment is linked to amendment No. 52, which relates to section 27. We acknowledge the engagement of the Senator on this matter. The amendment, once again, demonstrates that in all appropriate provisions of the legislation, the Government has been wiling to reassure everyone that we are fully committed to ensuring best practice in respect of children in the protection process is not only at its heart but is embedded in the work of all those who will engage with children seeking protection. The new section 25(6) states: "The best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the application of this section". While there may have been comments that there were not sufficient references to the best interests of the child, that has been addressed and such references are much more explicit than was previously the case.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 11:In page 12, to delete lines 20 to 23.This is a technical amendment. The advice of Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General's office is that this subsection is not required.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No, that is not the intent of amendment No. 11. That amendment was tabled on the advice of the Attorney General's office. I understand that the purpose of all of the amendments tabled to this Bill by Deputies is to improve the Bill from a humanitarian point of view. Were this legislation being debated anywhere else in Europe, the intent of a number of the amendments sought would be to not have as generous or humanitarian a focus as is provided for in this legislation. However, in Ireland we have political parties and representatives who are doing their best to ensure that our protection process is as humanitarian as possible. The Minister and I appreciate the motivation behind each amendment tabled. In not accepting any of the amendments, we are not in any way trying to refute or criticise the intentions of those who have tabled them. On amendment No. 12, the Bill, as set out in section 5, already provides for the serving of documents to legal representatives, where appropriate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister and I are satisfied that section 5, as drafted, adequately covers the serving of documents to legal representatives, which is the motivation behind amendment No. 12.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«These amendments deal primarily with the issue of domestic violence. I will deal with the amendments one by one. I cannot agree to amendments Nos. 13 and 14. The section in the Bill is in line with the EU qualifications directive and the list contained in section 7 of the Bill is not an exhaustive or limited one. I cannot agree to amendment No. 128 which relates to permission given to family members of qualified persons. The category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available to him or her, either by changing the residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999. Amendment No. 131 relates to permissions given to family members of qualified persons. Again, the category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available to him or her, either by changing the residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999. I, therefore, cannot agree to the amendment. The same issue and reasons apply in terms of amendment No. 132 as apply to amendment No. 131. Similar answers apply to amendments Nos. 143 and 144. I cannot agree to amendment No. 147. The list contained in the section is not exhaustive. Other forms of violence or abuse will be taken into account when dealing with international protection applications from vulnerable persons. Section 7(2)(a) defines acts which may amount to acts of persecution as including "acts of physical or mental violence, including acts of sexual violence". These can be used to establish an entitlement to protection need.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If someone had been offered protection under our system and the relationship breaks down with resulting separation or divorce proceedings, this does not mean someone would have to automatically leave the State. The individual could apply to change his or her residency permission under the Immigration Act. While it may appear that such protections are no longer afforded to the individual, avenues are available under the Act which the person can pursue. I consider this reasonable.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«An EU directive.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have already outlined my reasons for not accepting the amendments, although I understand the intent behind them. The Deputy's suggestion that it is a waste of time to table amendments does not stand up to scrutiny. Amendment No. 74, which has yet to be voted on but has already been discussed, on the best interests of the child principle is based on an amendment tabled by an Independent Senator in the Seanad. A number of amendments tabled by the Deputy's party are also being accepted by Government and I hope we will reach them today.Section 7 agreed to. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I cannot accept amendment No. 14 as the list provided for in the Bill is not exhaustive. I note there may be a suspicion that the list is an absolute and limited list but that is not the case. The list is not exhaustive and it is in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive. This is already encompassed within the text of the Bill and there is no need to prescribe it separately.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy to discuss the amendments individually.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendment No. 77 was tabled by Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Deputy Boyd Barrett and again, I cannot agree to this amendment. The wording of this section is taken from Article 4.1 of the recast qualification directive which does not include a provision along the lines of the proposed amendment. Indeed, accepting this amendment may lead to a person being granted refugee status who does not meet the definition of a refugee as outlined in the Geneva Convention.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will deal with the amendments one by one. Some of what we have done in the amendments is reflective of the debate in the Seanad, when Senator van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance had concerns around the Bill. I will explain that it will be necessary to have two opinions of the age of a suspected minor, not one, as previously envisaged, and also that the Child and Family Agency will be automatically involved. I cannot agree with amendments Nos. 16 and 17 as all applicants are asked for their date of birth as part of their initial interview on arrival. If the person gives a date of birth that makes them a minor, then they have self-identified as a minor, and that is the way it works. I also cannot agree with Sinn Féin's amendments Nos. 18 and 19 because there is a concern they may be too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person who is not covered in the suggested text of the amendments. Government amendment No. 72 is a technical drafting amendment. I cannot accept amendment No. 73, which seeks to insert a provision into section 24 which deals with the examination to determine the age of an unaccompanied minor in order to provide that such examinations should only be carried out as a measure of last resort. This amendment is not necessary. Section 24(1) clearly states that an age assessment examination will only be conducted when necessary for the purposes of determining the age of an applicant for international protection. Section 24(6) also provides that the best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the application of this section. Amendment No. 74 is a Government amendment linked to amendment No. 52, which concerns section 27. We acknowledge the input of Senator van Turnhout in regard to this matter, which relates to having two opinions rather than one and also the involvement of the Child and Family Agency. Government amendment No. 76 arose from an engagement with the Children's Rights Alliance and Department officials. The alliance has many NGO members from the protection sector. This amendment gives a further reassurance that the best interests of the child are at the heart of the Bill and provides specific safeguards as to the assessment of the child's capacity to understand the process. Those provisions were not in the Bill previously but they will be as a result of accepting these amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Officers will always err on the side of caution with children in age assessments, as they must because of the constitutional amendment passed and supported by all sides of this House. The issue with these amendments is that they risk adults claiming they are under 18. We have accepted Senator van Turnhout's advice on ensuring a second opinion is required and, if there is any doubt at all, the Child and Family Agency - Tusla intervenes. The officer has to err on the side of caution if there is any doubt in regard to the age of the applicant.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have sympathy with what the Deputy has just said because that was my assumption in the past as well, namely, that the system erred by making the assumption that nobody coming here was telling the truth.I watched a documentary recently where an individual whose job it was to assess these claims gleefully told the interviewer that he had sanctioned just two out of 600 applications for asylum status. Part of the conversation around this Bill seems to come from the same place, from suspicion and an ungenerous spirit. Senators and Deputies have put forward amendments on the issue of children and unaccompanied minors, which is a particularly sensitive area. In regard to the first amendment in this group, if somebody arrives here and gives a date of birth that clearly identifies him or her as a minor, he or she has self-identified as a minor. The previous system, as envisaged, was that one officer would make a determination on that application. Now, as a result of amendments that have been submitted, the determination is that two officers must make a determination. If one officer makes a determination, the second officer must corroborate it. If there is any doubt and if somebody is clearly not a minor, that may be evident. If there is any doubt - for cultural or other reasons - the person is not a minor, the Child and Family Agency becomes involved. Therefore, we now have a double lock system and an external independent agency that will be involved in the process. Previously, one individual had all the power. Now this has changed and two officers must collaborate on the opinion and the Child and Family Agency may then be involved in copper-fastening the decision. Notwithstanding what I said previously about the perception of an unsympathetic system, we must remember that asylum is a sacred status and the UNHCR has constantly reaffirmed this. We undermine that sacred status if we do not ensure those who acquire this status meet the international criteria, which is why we like to ensure these checks and balances are in the system.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If a 16 year old arrives in the manner articulated - I am sure that can and has happened - the determination on that situation is made by the protection officer with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. That is how that situation is dealt with. There is no suggestion that individual would not be entertained or that an application would not be processed. The amendments in this grouping deal with applications for international protection. I am not accepting amendment No. 20, as a provision is included to stop applicants making claims on behalf of their children in their own right, after their own cases have been completed, in an effort to frustrate the process and delay their removal from the State. Amendment No. 22 is a Government amendment. It is a technical amendment which adds a comma. I cannot accept amendment No. 23 as it would weaken the provision and would not be in the best interest of the child. Amendment No. 24 is a Government amendment which further amends and clarifies the information required to be provided by an applicant when making his or her application, which may have a bearing on other matters to be considered by the Minister for Justice and Equality as appropriate at any later stage. I am not agreeing to amendment No. 25, as a person arriving at the frontier of the State who is an unaccompanied minor will be referred to the Child and Family Agency, which will decide what is in the best interest of the child. The Child and Family Agency will make a decision on behalf of the child, based on the information and legal advice available to it. I am not agreeing to amendment No. 29, as the existing provision adequately balances the needs of the State and the circumstances of the individual and current practice takes account of personal circumstances. Amendment No. 75 is a technical Government amendment. I have already spoken on amendment No. 76 in the context of the interaction with the Children's Rights Alliance. Amendment No. 90 is a Government amendment which clarifies that an application for international protection may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the preparation of the report under section 38.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 22:In page 18, line 37, to delete “legal advice available to it” and substitute “legal advice, available to it”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 24:In page 19, to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:"(5) An application for international protection shall be made in the prescribed form and shall include—(a) all details of the grounds for the application, and(b) all information that would, in the event that section 48, 49, 55 or 56 were to apply to the applicant, be relevant to the decision of the Minister under the section concerned.".
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I agree with what the amendments are trying to achieve. A total of €6 million was allocated in the budget to fast-track many applications. That is why between 60 and 80 leave to remain cases are being processed each month since publication of the working group's report. The report is being implemented. I agree with the right to work. I accept what the Deputies are saying about the nine-month stipulation not being necessary if everybody has his or her application processed after six months, but the fundamental point about having a right to work should be acceded to by the Government. This is being done through the Cabinet social policy sub-committee. That is the mechanism through which I want to see it happen. It is not happening in the Bill, but I am not letting the issue go because, as Deputy Niall Collins said, I do not think we should be outside the European norm in this regard. The right to work is fundamental and we must vindicate it. As I said, it is not happening in the Bill, but I believe it will happen through the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health«2011-03-09«None«As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days he should contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for Health and other members of the Government for their efforts. I thank all Members of the Oireachtas for the leadership they have shown in their communities and constituencies in coming together to fight this invisible menace. I witnessed a funeral in my community this morning. It was very poignant to see people standing silently within a few metres of each other knowing the reason the person had passed away. It will stay with me for a long time. We cannot repeat often enough that the reason for these measures is so we will not have empty chairs around the table at Christmas. In his endeavours, the Minister will have the support of the Labour Party but that does not mean we cannot ask questions and move to a better system of tackling the issues we face. We have put down a number of questions for the Minister, particularly regarding the testing kits the HSE had in its possession from 23 February to 5 April. The issue of personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals arises time and again, as does the funding of such equipment.One of the issues which has come to our attention is the guidance the HSE has given to organisations in the homeless sector. Obviously, there are a number of vulnerable communities which will be more affected by this issue than others. It is quite right to say that viruses do not recognise borders but they sometimes recognise that some groupings and workers are more vulnerable than others. These include those working with very vulnerable people in homelessness services, who sometimes have underlying health issues or addictions. The HSE has issued guidelines for such workers but has not provided PPE for them. Will the Minister comment on that? I note his comments on the Be On Call for Ireland initiative. Will he provide statistics regarding who has been hired and a breakdown by location as to where they have been assigned? I know he has committed to doing so in response to an earlier question. I want to ask a question with regard to a previous suggestion in respect of the redeployment of special needs assistants. I believe the Minister's Department engaged with the trade union Fórsa yesterday, an accommodation was reached and a clarification sent out. There was, however, a great deal of disquiet among special needs assistants, SNAs, who were concerned they might be redeployed from the educational setting, with which they are familiar, to a setting with which they are not familiar. It would be appreciated if the Minister would clarify that no special needs assistant will be taken out of the education sphere, with which they are familiar and for which they are trained, and put into a different setting, for which they are not trained and about which they are concerned. We also want to ask about the childcare needs of healthcare workers. That is coming up again and again. I also wish to raise other issues, although I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to respond to them immediately. He may be able to respond in time. There seems to be an issue within the Department with regard to the renewal of medical cards. There seems to be confusion in that regard. Our own public representative, Senator Mark Wall, is getting different answers from the HSE and the Department with regard to his queries on the renewal of medical cards. Will the Minister speak to that? I referred earlier to those in homelessness services. Is the Minister's Department, or any other Department, analysing whether individuals facing economic disadvantage or the results of the high housing density, poor housing and higher levels of lower paid work in our society are experiencing higher levels of infection and hospitalisation? Is that analysis being done? If it is not, could it be done? Could we have a conversation in that regard? It is probably not accurate to suggest that we are all as susceptible to this virus as anybody else. This pandemic is ripping a plaster off some of our assumptions about our society and about how it works and is run. If the Minister cannot comment on that now, perhaps he could forward that information to me in good time. We will have to ask a lot of questions of our society after this pandemic has passed. On one level, it may always be with us. None of us in this House asks these questions to trip the Minister up or to be difficult. We are absolutely beside him as we fight this menace. What I witnessed this morning, however, certainly makes me more resolute, and should make all of us more resolute, to make sure we see the end of this crisis.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for being here. Like others, I have not been impressed by the level of communication on the part of his Department and of sections of this Oireachtas. I wrote to the Minister on 12 March suggesting a collegiate, collaborative partnership approach across the Chamber. We have had one meeting in the past six weeks, on 1 April. The Minister has said much about the advisory group. He has put a lot of stock in it but my understanding is that he has not attended any of the group's meetings. The Minister got support across the Chamber in respect of the oral examinations and political backing regarding the postponement of the leaving certificate, but every issue relating to the Department of Education and Skills has been mishandled. It was once said to me by a leading trade union official that the Department of Education and Skills understands two things, teachers and buildings. If an issue does not relate to a teacher or a building, the Department does not know how to deal with it. The Minister stated that the leaving certificate will start on 29 July. I ask him to confirm that date because what he says, how he says it and what the Department says has a massive impact on the mental health of the young people who are due to sit these examinations. It is a thumbscrew. It is not good enough for somebody in the Minister's position to state that the examinations might take place in July or in August and for it to be reported in The Irish Times that they might not take place until September. The Taoiseach stated in the House last week that the universities might not reopen until November. Every young person who is due to sit the leaving certificate is hearing all of this and wondering when somebody is going to make a decision. Also, the Government proposes to charge them €116 for the privilege. I am stunned at the Minister's statement that the best he can do is postpone the date for payment of the fee. It should be waived. Students should not be asked to pay €116 for the privilege of sitting the leaving certificate this year, particularly in light of what the majority of families are going through. The Minister would get cross-party support and plaudits were he to stand up right now and announce that for this year the fee will be waived. There is an argument that it should not be charged in a country that values the concept of free education. On SNAs, the Minister mentioned that he is thankful for their contribution to the national effort. I am of the view that SNAs are owed an apology by the Department of Education and Skills for the manner in which their redeployment was mishandled. Yet again, there was a communication to our SNAs, not from the Minister or his Department but from the HSE, to the effect that some of the redeployment work in which they may be engaging will be carried out at HSE premises. There is also a suggestion of a 12-week contract that will continue throughout the summer. What SNAs are wondering and worried about is if they are going to stay in the educational sphere and why it is taking so long for this to be clarified. Hand on heart, I believe the Department would not deal with the teaching body in that way or with any other public servants in that manner. I am quite sure hospital consultants are not being dealt with in that manner. I appreciate that the Minister referred to rent refunds and the University of Limerick. On speculation regarding primary schools, I accept that what happened is not the fault of the Minister present. However, it is not good enough for another Minister to wonder in a Sunday Independent interview about schools reopening in June because every teacher then begins to wonder what will happen in June. They think that if a Minister is saying this in an interview, there must be something in it. Every teacher then starts to worry about childcare and every parent begins to wonder if he or she can justifiably send his or her child back to school in June. They wonder if this is really happening or if it is just something a Minister said off the top of his or her head. I appreciate these are trying times. Nobody here is trying to score points. We have been doing our best for the last six weeks to back the Minister but we are receiving huge numbers of emails from exasperated parents and students around the country. It is not good enough for a Minister to suggest that the schools will open for one day or for a half a day per week in June. I want to ask the Minister a direct question about students who received SUSI, VTOS and back to education initiative grants and who are not able to complete their courses.Could the Minister address that? Finally, is there a plan B for the leaving certificate? None of us in this House looks at the Minister's situation and feels that any of this is his fault. He was handling the situation and the pandemic arrived. In fairness, as far as the oral examinations and the postponement of the leaving certificate are concerned, he has chosen the best worst option and has got political support on that. No one in the political system has pulled him up on that or scored a point against him on it. There must, however, be much more transparency on this issue because everything that comes out of his mouth is listened to by, as I said, every student and every teacher in the country. It is justifiable criticism that it was on an online forum on Tuesday that he decided to give us the date of 29 July. That date should have been announced in this forum, this House, or in a forum with which everyone in the country is familiar or in which everyone feels able to have some over and back with him on the matter. I have raised a lot of issues with the Minister but I want him to address the timetable. I want him to refer in his answer to the fee, special needs assistants and the other issues I raised.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I look forward to the Minister's responses to the issues I am going to raise. Nobody needs to be reminded that we are in the middle of a pandemic. It is a national crisis and the health concerns are foremost in our minds. However, the ability of people to respond to the crisis is hugely impacted by how and where they live. One is more likely to survive this crisis if one has a better quality of accommodation. What the crisis has done is rip off the plaster we have over many of our public services and expose the way we live in Ireland. Our response in this period of time has to be far-reaching. It must involve an acceptance of many of the failures of Irish society and a collective pledge that we will not allow these things to re-emerge. We have been talking forever in this House about a State response to childcare provision, ending the two-tier health system and, God forbid, implementing a rent freeze. We were told there are complications around these issues and they cannot happen. Then a crisis comes and we find they can happen. I remember only too vividly the raised voices in this House the last time we had a major national crisis over the economic collapse. Those raised voices were about the behaviour of the banks and why we had to fund them, invest in them and bankroll them. We could not do anything in this country without them and we had to have lending starting again. They would learn their lesson, they would change and everything would be better. Of course, it only took the next crisis for many financial institutions to see their opportunity and revert to type. It is no surprise to me and many other people that the same banking ethic or lack thereof, the amorality within the system, prevails. These institutions see an opportunity to screw somebody and they are going to screw them. That is happening today. Given that the Minister's Department has not an absolute knowledge but certainly a huge amount of knowledge of how housing works and the nature and dynamics of the sector in this country, is it working with the Department of Finance on analysing the issues, including the nature of mortgage distress, and working out how the two Departments can work together to address the issues in the coming months and years in order to keep people in their homes? Do we have an answer for the people who have lost their jobs and feel they will not necessarily have an opportunity to return to employment in the short term?If the banks are sending people letters, telephoning them or increasing interest rates, as they do because that is what they do, do we have a response for that as a people? Do we have a response to that as a Parliament? I know this is a cliché, and it feels almost like a political point-scoring exercise, but when the banks needed us the State stepped in and did not let them fail. Now that the people need us and the banks are not their friends, if the Minister and his Department are not already having conversations with the Department of Finance, will they start having those conversations and not wait for the time when this comes tumbling down the road as a major issue in households across the country?  On homeless services, I understand that the PPE required by those on the front line dealing with very vulnerable people in our homeless services, many of whom are living in conditions that many of us in this House would not live in - the pandemic again exposing the nature of the limitations of their living circumstances - has not been made available to them. Is the Minister having conversations with the HSE and the Department of Health about that? I am interested in the Minister's comment about council funding. He mentioned that if any of us were being told by our local council that it could not fund a particular project because it did not have the resources, he would like to know. I appreciate those comments. I am sure the Minister will be getting a lot of correspondence in that regard. The Minister also referred to the issue regarding UL, which is fair enough. He also responded to the issue about direct provision. That is fair enough as well. My final question concerns strategic housing developments and the Minister's view of it. I have noted his comment about objections, etc. One of the issues that people have with the strategic housing development legislation is that it totally overrode the democratically constituted development plan of the local authority voted in by councillors and that it went straight to An Bord Pleanála, which does not have to adhere to that development plan and, therefore, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, through this legislation, has afforded developers the rule book. They own it and they can do what they like with it. In my part of the world I am dealing with a fire service which I am told does not have the capacity to deal with any fire above the sixth floor of an apartment block, yet An Bord Pleanála is handing out planning permissions for major scale developments across the northside of Dublin and the State. What we all want, as I am sure the Minister will agree, are communities. We want housing as a public good that helps communities and people to grow together. Where the show is being run by somebody with a profit motive, it will have a major influence on the direction of policy.  I would appreciate the Minister's comments on those issues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his responses to others. He has already responded to many of the issues I wished to raise. I want him to publish the public health advice he has received in respect of cancelling the leaving certificate. I appreciate it was a difficult decision and I know it was not taken lightly. The Minister stated in his he got advice from NPHET which he has published, but I want to know if NPHET or Dr. Tony Holohan gave him advice to cancel the exams and if that was the basis on which he decided to cancel the exams. If that was the basis, if we cannot have 18 or 19 year old adults doing written exams in August, how can we expect infants to go to overcrowded primary schools in September? I again ask the Minister to publish the advice. On the appeals process and the timeline of what will happen after this process has been completed, the ASTI has told its members that the marking itself cannot be appealed. Will the Minister, through his Department, please communicate directly with principals and set out exactly the timeline and appeals process? Apparently, students who are not happy with the assessed grades they receive have two options. First is to submit an appeal, which will not take into account the grade he or she got, and second is to sit the written exam whenever that might take place. Will the Minister confirm to the House that this is the case? If it is the case, will he please communicate directly with principals so that they know the exact timeline and process involved? On school profiling, the Department's website states, "estimated marks from each school will be adjusted to bring them into line with the expected distribution for the school". I sometimes wonder if enough people in the House or society have any comprehension of what it is like to attend a DEIS school and the number of barriers between the pupils and their ability to maximise their potential in this Republic. I sometimes wonder if people really know what it is like. This is probably the only opportunity in many instances for students to break out of poverty and disadvantage. The one opportunity they have is a written exam or an exam where the person marking the exam does not know who they are, where they are from or the school they attend.The Minister has school league tables within his Department and it is not even possible to make a freedom of information, FOI, request for them because the Department knows they are unfair and give an unfair representation of the education system. Those tables are published in newspapers and every year, education spokespeople and Ministers come out and criticise them and they cannot be requested from the Department by FOI. Yet, this is the very profiling information that will be used to assess an individual's leaving certificate. How devastating must it be for students to grind through situations where they teach themselves honours mathematics, honours Irish or another higher level subject because it is not available in their schools? That is the determination some young people in this country have to break out of disadvantage and poverty. They knew that when the script was being marked, it would be anonymous. That is gone now, however, because the very profiling the Minister will not allow to be requested by FOI from his Department will be used to assess somebody's expected distribution from the school.  With the greatest of respect, I cannot accept the answer the Minister gave to other Deputies regarding school profiling. The Labour Party will accept the assessed grades system as proposed by the Minister. We appreciate there is no other option at this stage but we will not accept the school profiling. We cannot do that because it is fundamentally unfair. The simplest thing for the Minister to do now is to delete that from the process and to let each script and assessed grade stand on its own merits. I state that because I do not agree with the Minister when he states that an average student from a fee-paying school will not be advantaged by this system. If I was an average student from a fee-paying school, I would be much happier today than were I an exceptional student from a disadvantaged school. That is because students will be assessed by the history of their schools and, inevitably, someone from a fee-paying background or who has access to tutoring outside the school system will benefit from that. I ask the Minister to please just get rid of the school profiling aspect and then we can all move on together. Regarding additional needs, and the issue of July provision has been raised by other Deputies, the Minister has said he is open to expanding it and I accept his statement. Turning to SNAs, however, there is still a level of confusion concerning them. I also refer to the level of disrespect they have received through this process, as has been mentioned elsewhere. The goodwill the SNAs have shown has not been replicated by the Department. It has been said to me many times that the Department understands dealing with school buildings and teachers but it does not know how to deal with things that are not school buildings or teachers. A direct communication from the Minister to SNAs, not via a trade union or the HSE, would be greatly appreciated.  My last point, and I will appreciate the Minister's response, is that leaving certificate applied students feel as if they are not involved in this conversation. When the Minister refers to the leaving certificate, will he please put it on record that he also refers to the leaving certificate applied? Otherwise, students taking that option feel they are being relegated in this conversation. For those students we hope and expect will be sitting a written exam in 2021, namely, fifth year students watching this entire situation with great uncertainty and upset, I ask the Minister to speak to them, their experience and what they can expect in 2021. They have missed out on a great deal of class time. What sort of mitigation will the Minister make for their school experience? 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know. I taught them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sorry, hold on. On a point of order-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----there is no point in the Minister telling me he will not get into a row with me, pointing a finger at me and calling me a disgrace. I am calling the Minister's process, not the Minister, a disgrace.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Expected distribution.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister back to the House. He will be aware of the Labour Party position on the issue of assessed grading and school profiling. We are very much against school profiling. I have written to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to seek its viewpoint. The equivalent body in the United Kingdom has issued guidelines to the UK education department relating to assessed grading. The position of the UK body is that it potentially negatively affects minority children, children with additional needs, children from disadvantaged backgrounds and, specifically, high-achieving children in disadvantaged settings. I expect or hope that IHREC will issue the Department with some recommendations. I hope the school profiling element, which is so controversial and unnecessary, can be deleted from the Minister's assessment criteria, which he will publish tomorrow. I refer to the issue of schools that may lose teachers. In September, schools get notification of appeals. I am going to mention a school but I will not name it. The Minister knows of the school because I sent the details to him yesterday. The school is going to lose a teacher because it has 200 students on the roll but it needs 201.It is in a particular location that has suffered a huge incidence of violence in the past 18 months. The Government admitted a necessity to have a Mulvey-style task force for this area to identify reasons for the violence and to provide supports for the community, one of which would be educational supports. There was even a shooting there today, which was the second in a week in that postcode. This DEIS band 1 school is acutely disadvantaged and on the basis of one student, it is being told it will lose a teacher. We would love the Minister to get to his feet today and tell us there will be a pause or moratorium, and no school in the country will lose a teacher in September given the circumstances we are in. I appreciate that he cannot make that commitment, as it would be expensive and not every situation is the same. I ask him to look at it nonetheless or at least to have a sympathetic appeals process that would take into account schools like this going through such a position, meaning they will lose a teacher unnecessarily in September. I have sent him the details and I hope he or the Department will look on the case sympathetically. I know he has said the process is independent but he can start a new process so a school like this would not lose a teacher in September. The Minister mentioned the July provision and I appreciate a large element of his statement was about it. It will give much comfort to people who have asked me to raise the matter with him. I congratulate him and thank him but we need to know when dates will be known along with further details. Please get those to us as soon as possible. On the matter of schools returning, there is much disquiet because the Government's messaging is so tight when it comes to matters of commerce, business or retail but with education, the messaging is sloppy. The Minister for Health can say in an interview in the Sunday Independent that schools might go back in June, for example. In this very Chamber last Wednesday we had a questions and answers session but the Taoiseach was wondering whether schools or childcare facilities could come back more quickly because these might not be as high a risk as other areas. The Minister might have a different position. It is as if education is not important so people can talk off the top of their heads. We all know the difference between hardware and homeware stores, however, because the messaging is so tight. Why is the messaging around education so loose? This is so damaging and causes much upset. We are getting representations from teachers and parents who are wondering what on Earth is going on. Are schools going back in June? Will they be held over until September? There are different views on that and nobody in the Chamber will demand that the Minister should bring schools back in June. Nobody would want to stand over a demand that may be regretted in a number of months. Will the Minister nonetheless give some certainty to the process, how the decision will be made, who will make it and what advice will be sought or taken on board if and when the decision is made? If a decision is made, will schools return on a phased basis? I refer to the Teaching Council. I understand trainee teachers are having difficulty with the council, as are those who are currently registering. Those who have made approaches to the council as of 7 April have yet to get responses and those going through Hibernia College have been told they must plough on with their online teacher training course, including going to the Gaeltacht. Students feel that is completely unrealistic in current circumstances. The Teaching Council oversees the process so will the Minister speak to that? Others have spoken about third level students. This pandemic has ripped open many issues that are live in society but now we have the opportunity to talk about them and perhaps do something. Students might partake in low-paid work over the course of the summer to survive their years in third level education. A more robust and sympathetic SUSI system for one year would recognise those students who are trying to break out of disadvantage and, in many cases, become the first person from their households to attend third level or further education and prevent it from becoming a case of them telling themselves that they cannot do it now because they cannot get the jobs they would have got otherwise to be able to afford it and that they must drop out and think about doing something else. If the Minister could speak to these issues, I would appreciate it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is worth stating - and I would ask the Minister to agree on the floor of the House this evening - that climate change is still the greatest strategic threat to mankind, even in this era of Covid-19. I hope the Minister agrees that adapting to and trying to mitigate climate change will require massive State investment in changing the way we live our lives and run our societies. It is vital to ensure that the post-Covid stimulus package required is not wasted on reinstating the status quo. It is vital that we kill two birds with one stone by investing in green industry and putting workers and communities at the heart of that just transition. In that context, I welcome and recommend the paper, "Approaches to Transition", recently presented to the NESC by Dr. Jeanne Moore, which provides context for the choices we need to make. We need to put workers and their trade unions at the centre of the policies, strategies and approaches outlined in that report. The immediate effects on our communities are apparent from the interim report produced by the just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey. While we welcome this report and we thank Mr. Mulvey for it, I would like to ask the Minister if he really believes that we are doing everything we can. Is he satisfied with the pace and scale of action? We need to ensure that employees in Shannonbridge, Lanesborough, Littleton in north Tipperary and east Galway and seasonal workers across the region who have relied on Bord na Móna for their incomes are not abandoned. We need to look after those who have already lost their jobs as well as those who are about to. The greatest challenge for us all is ensuring that new jobs are available in places where the older jobs are being lost and that the gap between the old jobs vanishing and the new jobs appearing does not destroy people's ability to sustain themselves and result in the economic destruction of our communities. Running quickly through some of the measures the Minister outlined in the Government's response to the report, I ask whether they really give a sense that we are acting fast enough. On the just transition fund, €11 million seems a meagre enough investment in the context of training and business supports. Is it enough? In his response, the Minister stated, "The Department ... will write to State agencies and enterprises to identify land and facilities". I get no sense of urgency from this. How long will the Department wait for a response? The Minister also stated: "The Department and ESB will commission a study to examine the potential for using the existing infrastructure in the West Offaly and Lough Ree power plants as an Energy Hub in the Midlands." Does this really convey any urgency?Is this information not quickly available to both the ESB and Bord na Móna already? Digital hubs and remote working are worthy objectives. Many have experience of them right now, but will they really address the needs of those directly affected? I agree absolutely that more electric charging points are needed but a bit more detail is also needed. The midlands retrofitting scheme, worth €20 million, is a great project but we need to know the scale. The centre for climate change and just transition represents an excellent project if the scale is sufficient. Does the Minister have any idea when we will have detail on specific support for the midlands under the European Green Deal? The overall impression I have is of a holding pattern. We need to grasp the nettle and realise that a large number of people will be left behind if we do not act faster, increase invest and consider more radical solutions to immediate problems. In view of the success of the Covid-19 pandemic wages support scheme and pandemic payment schemes, has the Minister considered proposing targeted, long-lasting direct supports, modelled on pandemic measures, for affected workers in order to bridge the gap between job losses and the creation of new industries? As with Covid, jobs are being threatened through no fault of the workers. It is a strategic, external threat of global magnitude. I strongly welcome the recent move by Coillte to reclassify its forests in Dublin for non-commercial recreational use. I hope a more balanced strategy of development for Coillte can be extended across the country as part of our climate emergency.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is aware that the world is saying with one voice that black lives matter. I raise this issue because it appears to me we should be cognisant of the fact that we stand in probably the whitest parliament in the world, and that our teaching profession should reflect the students they teach. We have been remiss in trying to get a teaching profession or role models in the professions such as teaching, nursing and the Garda, that reflect the general population. I am not sure of the statistics for members of the Traveller community or people from minority groups who are in the teaching profession but I am interested to know what kinds of conversations are happening in the Department of Education about promoting such a pathway for people from various different backgrounds to be role models and leaders in education. I do not know the statistics but I can only imagine that the teaching profession is probably similar to the political profession in this regard. There is a lot we can change in Irish society. Many people will know Members, who sit currently in this House, who have said things they should regret about Travellers, migrants and asylum seekers. We have to find mechanisms in every Department on how we can change attitudes. Many students now sit in classrooms with people from all sorts of backgrounds, which is to be welcomed, but in most cases the teachers are quite similar. I ask that the Minister would reflect on that and see what the Department of Education and teacher training colleges are doing to reach out to have an education and teaching profession, including a special needs assistant profession, that is reflective of the student body. I shall now turn to the issue of returning to school. When listening to the mixed messaging, as referred to earlier, sometimes I get frustrated with how differently education is treated to how the economy is treated. We speak about education in very different ways. When we speak about the retail sector or the economy there is nothing that cannot be addressed. Rent can be addressed, rates can be addressed and paying staff can be addressed. When we talk of schools losing teachers, however, the Minister said the system has not changed because of Covid-19.Why can the system not change because of Covid? The last time we spoke I mentioned to the Minister a school in an acutely disadvantaged area that is one student short of keeping a teacher for September. Every school will greatly struggle in September to keep the show on the road and to get students back into the classroom. Secondary school principals tell me we will lose a generation because students they have been clinging to for years to keep them in the education system, who legally do not have to be there after the age of 16, are now making a decision not to go back. The discontinuation of education has been so profound in their lives they are unlikely to go back in September. Unless we frontload this area with huge resources and realise how important it is we will not get them back and we will lose a generation. What frustrates me about the language used is that I do not really get the sense this is a priority or of how enormous it will be for schools to reopen in September for young people and children to have the chance to change the direction in their lives. It will cost money. People speak about other examples in various European countries. They are putting money into it. They are putting staff into it. Sanitation has been mentioned, as has the figure of €25 million that it will cost. I want the Minister to be aware of a project undertaken by four students in St. Seachnall's national school in Dunshaughlin. I will send the Minister the details so he will be aware of it. They did a project on sanitising their school and they want it to go nationwide. Laura Kilbane, Emily Lynch, Julia Olelale and Adelina Stewart are anxious that the project be taken on by the Department and rolled out. I want to ask about safe passes. It appears that imagination which could be used by the Department is not being used. For a construction worker or someone who wants to get an apprenticeship the safe pass is everything but the system does not seem to be able to bend to the new reality. I am told, from speaking to the Connect Trade Union, that the trade union movement is willing to step up to the mark and fill in the gaps that need to be filled. There is potential for these courses to be delivered online. SOLAS oversees it but, unfortunately, it is unbending. This is under the Department and I ask the Minister please to speak about the safe pass so that people moving from one jurisdiction back to Ireland or from one profession to another will not have this pause button on their potential to start work or start their apprenticeship. It appears that the Government is all over finding a solution for some sectors of the economy but when it comes to issues such as education and safe passes it is unbending. Something else that is unbending is the Teaching Council. Under the Droichead framework for teachers' probation, primary teachers must have 60 days in a school and secondary school teachers need 200 hours in a school. Nothing after 13 March will count. Primary school teachers could have done 59 days since 13 March, doing the best they can online trying to educate children, but it will not count for their probation. This is another unbending arm of the Department. For some reason the Department will not change its ways. It is causing a huge amount of frustration for young teachers trying to get into the profession and young people trying to get their safe pass. Principals are worried about getting students back in September or being one student short to keep a teacher. Everything in the Department is unbending. It just will not bend. When it comes to the economy, retail and all the other lobbyists on the radio every day of the week, the world can change for them because people need to buy flights and snack boxes in Supermac's. The Minister mentioned the July provision and I appreciate the fact he has given it an awful lot of airtime in this contribution and in his previous contribution. I congratulate him for that. There is a rolling ongoing scandal in the country regarding children who have a diagnosis of autism who do not have a school place in September. It will be compounded this year because of Covid-19. The issue is between the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and it is the classic problem in Irish education when something falls between two Departments; both Departments have the perfect answer that it is the other's problem. Parents struggling with a diagnosis and challenge in their families are handed a list of schools and told "off you go".I know parents who have been to 15 or 19 schools which have all found mechanisms for saying "No". The Minister now has power under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to force a school to open a unit, or demand that it do so, and I want him to speak to that. These are extraordinary times. Everybody appreciates that and everybody sitting here, asking these questions appreciates the fact that it is a difficult time but the Department of Education and Skills needs to unbend. The Department knows how to deal with schools and teachers but it does not know how to, or feels that it cannot, deal with anyone outside that and it has no empathy for the situation. If the Minister does not have time to respond to all my questions I would appreciate a written response. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for the work he has done on issues I raised last week. The safe pass issue has been resolved, and I thank the Minister for that. I thank him also for his work on July provision because I understand that he has demanded, against the advice of his officials, a more expansive and more inclusive July provision and that might be the reason for the mixed messages in that the Department is saying one thing to advocacy groups, but the Minister is steadfast in demanding a better system. For that, I congratulate him. I find it difficult sometimes to listen to Deputies in this House who with a straight face can almost bring one to tears with their advocacy for children, yet their political parties at the same time in a different room are advocating for the abolition of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I want to put on the record of this House that this country has an appalling record on children's rights. As recently as this year we heard of the scandal in Scouting Ireland. The life chance one has is formed by one's childhood. That is the reason we have a Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It is under-resourced and it needs more support. A classic example is the way childcare is way down the list of priorities in the political system.It is gross hypocrisy for people to come into this House and speak on behalf of children who are losing opportunities in school life and refer to how desperate the situation is for those children and their parents, while at the same time their political parties are trying to manoeuvre into a situation where we can abolish the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Children with special educational needs are poorly served in this Republic because they fall between two Departments. I believe more than 1,400 children in my constituency are on a waiting list for speech and language therapy. I have a letter from a father who received a letter from the HSE telling him the waiting time for the intervention his daughter needs in Beechpark Services is five years. Children with additional educational needs are more likely to suffer unemployment, abuse and discrimination and they are also more likely to end up in addiction. Parents are saying they are exhausted because when they try to advocate for their children no one seems to listen and resources do not seem to be available. They are being forced to be almost full-time campaigners, which they cannot be because they have to be full-time parents. I held a meeting to discuss this issue in my constituency last October. There were several speakers and I expected about 20 people to attend, whereas 150 people showed up. All of them were exhausted. I appreciate the efforts the Minister is making. Some of the comments made to me concern the acknowledgement that two months in the summer is too long for a child with additional needs to be without some kind of structure, such as the July provision scheme provided in previous years. Given children have been out of the school system for several months, surely a longer school programme or July provision scheme is now required. The Minister might be in a position to address that issue. There are also parents of children due to attend school for the first time in September. They are hoping the scheme could be expanded to include them because it has been difficult to acclimatise children to a school setting in the same way as happened previously.  What happens if a school says "No" to a request from parents? I am aware of a letter sent from the Saplings educational facility, which has, I believe, five schools for children with autism. A letter was sent yesterday to parents stating that due to the non-availability of suitably qualified and experienced full-time staff and the complex needs of pupils, the organisation will not be in a position to provide July provision. This matter again falls between the Minister's Department, the Department of Health and the HSE. It is fair to say that children with additional needs, such as autism and other complex needs, are very poorly served in our education system. They are also poorly served outside of the system.  The idea that we should put children, in a departmental sense, at the bottom of the list of political priorities as people jostle as regards Government formation is an outrageous suggestion. That needs to be stopped right now. The Minister will not admit this, and I know he is fighting an internal battle in this regard, but the approach of the Department is to outsource everything to the school and if the school says "No", there is not much the Department can do. Parents will tell us they get lists of schools from the special education needs organiser, SENO. The SENO will state the child has autism, provide a list of schools that may be applied to and then he or she wishes the parents the best of luck. Parents in my constituency get a list of schools located as far away as Drogheda. I know parents who have applied to school after school, and the schools have all found legitimate, or other, reasons to say "No". I mentioned last week that the Minister, under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, has the power to intervene and demand a school open a unit. It seems that in this programme for the summer months the Department is again outsourcing its responsibility. If a school says "No" to a request from parents, that is just the way it goes. I appreciate that the Minister will give more detail on Friday. As it is now early June and the programme is due to start in July, I would like to give some sense of reassurance to parents that if the Saplings Special Schools organisation to which I referred or another local school says "No", the Department will be in a position to step up and provide this resource for children which we all accept is greatly needed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In Ireland we are in a unique position, in between Brexit and Trump, to give a different view to the world of the nature of discrimination and of our own experience because of our own history. We are the people of Famine ships, who have gone to every corner of world. We understand the immigrant experience like no other. That is why it is deeply disappointing when people in this House use racism, fear and language to punch down. Racism is about power. It is sometimes about trying to isolate a group that one feels is not powerful, because one can, and therefore to give power to oneself. We have Deputies in this House who have said that asylum seekers are freeloaders, blackguards and hoodlums, that asylum seekers need to be deprogrammed and that asylum seekers are here to sponge off the system. We have two members of a governing party who have been on the wrong side of anti-Traveller literature controversies, one of whom sits at Cabinet. A number of years ago a Fine Gael councillor said in a public statement that he would not deal with black Africans. He lost the Whip for 18 months. We need to call out the hypocrisy of standing in a Parliament like this full of white people and saying that racism is something other people do because it is what politicians in Ireland do. The reaction to racism among public representatives is often that he or she was not speaking for the party, and then we move on.  There is a sense that statements, such as anti-Traveller rhetoric, are not racism but are instead something different. I first ran for election in the local elections in 2004, which coincided with the 2004 citizenship referendum proposed by Fianna Fáil and supported by Fine Gael. It was a deliberate attempt, in my mind, to punch down at or amplify a suspicion that one cannot trust an asylum seeker because there were suggestions that heavily pregnant asylum seekers were in Ireland purely to get citizenship for their children. Can one imagine holding a constitutional referendum on that matter on the same day as a local election? One can only imagine the type of poison that unleased. Let us please not stand in this auditorium, Parliament and Assembly and say that racism is what other people in Irish society do and that we have no part in it because we do. I do not think people and political parties in this Parliament should be going to fundraisers in America and taking money from racist Trump supporters. I do not think that is good enough. We have to call out Irish America on its support for the current President of the United States. We have to call out Irish communities in Britain who are anti-immigrant, something which is so hypocritical that it is astounding. If we do not take that stand, who will? How can we go to the United States on St. Patrick's Day, hand over bowls of shamrock and advocate for the undocumented Irish in America, and not do the very same for the 26,000 undocumented workers here? They are vulnerable, poorly paid and are in vulnerable work.  Daniel O'Connell once said about the Irish slave owner, "How can the generous, the charitable, the humane, and the noble emotions of the Irish heart have become extinct amongst you?" It is important, then, for the current generation of Irish leaders to speak to the hearts and experience of Irish-American, Anglo-Irish or Irish-Australian politicians all over the world who engage in racist, xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment about the history of the coffin ships, discrimination, being on the lowest rung and being punched down.  What can we do? I mentioned that we need to work on the regularisation of undocumented migrants. We need to pass the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018, not just for Traveller children but for all Irish children. We need to legislate for citizenship for children born here. We do not need another referendum to overturn what happened in 2004. The 2004 amendment enabled this Assembly to pass whatever legislation it wished to. We need to change that. We need to ensure we have citizenship rights for every child who is born here. We need to extend the right to work for asylum seekers by removing the erroneous barriers that exist to their working here. We need to legislate against hate speech. The Minister spoke about the 1989 Act, which has been proven to be effectively useless. Many agencies and groups have unsuccessfully tried over a number of years to get better and more robust hate-speech and hate-crime legislation. Now is the time to do it. I have spoken previously about the importance of having the Dáil, the Seanad, the teaching profession, the Garda and other public service professions reflect the population they serve. It is not good enough to say it is an aspiration. It is important for us to actually do something about it. For an Irish Nigerian child, an Irish Polish child or an Irish Traveller child, how powerful would it be to have somebody in their classroom teaching them who looks just like them? For people who are white and particularly who are male, the world is run by people who look just like them and the television is full of people who look just like them. For those who are not it can be a very cold place and it can feel as if they do not fit in. We have had a bad history of this with people with particular accents, people from particular addresses and obviously people from the Traveller community. Now is the opportunity to make our public broadcaster, the teaching profession, the Garda and this Assembly more reflective of the population. With 11 appointments due to be made to the Seanad in a number of weeks, there is no reason not to put the fine words of the Minister's speech into action and actually appoint to the Seanad - to these Houses of the Oireachtas - somebody from these minority communities, rather than a party political hack, which is inevitably what will happen. How powerful would it be to have somebody from the black community or the Traveller community in Ireland sitting in the Seanad because the Taoiseach has made it a priority? Alternatively, will we just go back to the way we were? Running for election and getting elected is important and if punching down on asylum seekers, immigrants or Travellers is what gets someone elected, that is just the way the system works. As has been said, all of us have our prejudices. Anybody who stands up here and says they do not have prejudices is telling lies because we all have. We all grew up in this country and we all know about the sectarianism, the anti-Traveller sentiment and the prejudices that are all around us. We all feel them, and we often let ourselves down by using them. Certainly, the political system could do much more than just the words that are spoken here today.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Minister on the announcement on the investment in the arts. I also congratulate the campaigners from the National Campaign for the Arts who were making the case. The arts are extremely important to this country. This area is often one of the only avenues where people from disadvantaged or diverse backgrounds can give voice to their experience. It is a very welcome investment and greatly needed. Hopefully there will be more to come. I will start by reading into the record a quote from the summary of the biodiversity climate change sectoral adaptation plan:By the end of the century, climate change is likely to become the most significant driver of biodiversity loss. Increases in temperature will change the timing of life cycle events and the distribution of species. The physical impact of more intense storms and increased winter/spring rainfall will accelerate the degradation of habitats that are already compromised by unsustainable practices.I am delighted to be able to come here and report on the Minister's actions under the 2019 annual transition statement. I remind the House that it was my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, who introduced the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, under which the Minister is here reporting on her Department's responsibilities under the annual transition statement. It is important that the work started by a Labour Party Minister is continuing here today. While specifically holding the Minister, Deputy Madigan, to account, it is also important that the next Government kicks on to deliver on climate change with an urgency that perhaps the last Government failed to do. The climate is too important an issue to be the subject of petty wrangling for political positioning or to be the preserve or responsibility of one party. In 2018 I am happy that we in the Labour Party helped to lead and drive the Committee on Climate Action to adopt the concept of carbon budgets and we look forward to supporting appropriate measures in the strengthening and implementation of these budgets. There may be times when support is needed from across the Chamber and I speak for my party colleagues when I reassure all of those who are serious about tackling climate change that the Labour Party will intend to share the responsibility of everyone in the House to deliver on Ireland's international target commitments. This brings me to two sectoral areas for which the Minister and the Department are responsible - the built and archaeological heritage sector and biodiversity. I have three broad questions for the Minister. My first question is on the Department's own direct emissions. What action has been taken to evaluate emissions from within the Department or subsidiary organisations such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service? Have they invested in electric vehicles and in making buildings more energy efficient? Does the Minister know if the Department is walking the walk in its own day-to-day emissions? My second question is on the built and archaeological heritage climate change sectoral adaptation plan. It is clear from the plan that the Department has identified significant threats to some of the most important cultural physical heritage in the State. There are a number of case studies. The threat identified to Trinity College Dublin and the damage done to coastal areas in Portrane are examples of the scale of the potential threat. What, if any, framework does the Department propose to put in place to identify when hard coastal measures will be justifiable to protect Dublin city and our heritage? What coastal defence measures will be needed? My third question is on the responsibilities of the biodiversity adaptation plan. Will the Minister indicate what work has been put in place to resolve the inevitable conflict between the protection and preservation of habitats, and the need to develop the infrastructure needed to help reduce our emissions? I am referring to transport infrastructure such as cycleways and walkways, renewable energy infrastructure such as offshore and onshore wind, and coastal defence projects. It may be necessary to protect our coastal towns, villages and cities, which are often built close to areas under the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Are any measures being taken to try to have a standard and scientific approach to decide how we will resolve the conflict between such projects and our biodiversity responsibilities? I commend the Department and the Minister for the depth of both sectoral reports, and I commend those who worked on and prepared those reports.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Tá dhá cheist agam don Aire. Tá sé ríthábhachtach do Theachta McHugh mar Aire, mar pholaiteoir agus mar dhuine go n-osclódh na scoileanna ar fad i mí Mheán Fómhair. Tá sé tábhachtach dúinne, do pháistí agus tuismitheoirí na tíre agus d'achan duine ar fud na tíre. Cén sórt ciste airgeadais a chuirfear ar fáil chun an oscailt mhór seo a chur i gcrích? Ní bheidh sé saor. Beidh tuilleadh áiseanna, agus b'fhéidir tuilleadh múinteoirí, ag teastáil. Cén sórt ciste airgeadais nó tacaíocht airgeadais a bheidh ar fáil ionas go bhféadfaimis na scoileanna ar fad, idir bhunscoileanna agus mheánscoileanna, a oscailt i mí Mheán Fómhair nó mí Lúnasa? It is a great ambition of the Minister to open all schools in late August or September, and it is something we need to work towards. What financial package will be made available to make it happen? We know from other sectors that when announcements were made, financial packages were brought forward. That is welcome and it is the right thing to do. It is justifiable for us to ask if the Government is serious about opening schools in late August or September and what financial package it will put in place to allow that to happen. It will not be cheap. The schools environment will be under huge scrutiny from parents, teachers and school managers as to how safe it is. Will the Minister tell us what kind of financial measure the Government is putting in place to allow for a safe reopening of schools? He has been very responsive to us and has been here most weeks answering questions. I again put the same question that is put here every week as to what we can do to ensure schools do not suffer because of a lack of staff. Teachers are being lost over the course of the summer and, in many instances, there is going to be a major impact on the ability of schools to open in September in the way they would like to do. My second question concerns school meals. The Minister will have the ready-made, go-to answer that this is not a matter for his Department, which I appreciate is correct. He mentioned that he has been talking to Ministers in other countries about what they are doing about reopening schools. That type of engagement is what Ministers should do. Every other jurisdiction in these islands has committed to continuing its school meals programme over the summer. The provision has been extended in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and, in the most high-profile case, in England. The authorities in all those jurisdictions have recognised that vulnerable children will go hungry if their respective school meals programmes do not continue over the summer. In fairness to the Government, it recognised this issue at Easter, when the school meals provision was continued over that two-week period. Schools, including their teaching staff and SNAs, rallied around to ensure that could be done. The whole school community made it work. However, when I put in a parliamentary question purely to get clarification that the scheme would continue over the summer, I was surprised and disappointed to discover that it is not the intention or plan to do so. I wish to elaborate on why this programme is needed. In any economic collapse, as the Minister knows, unemployment rises. We have heard that cases of domestic violence have risen as well as cases of addiction, and there is a huge mental health strain on families. In those circumstances, it is inevitable that where families are under huge pressure, including financial strain, decisions have to be made and children may lose out by going hungry. This is not necessarily a comfortable topic to talk about but it is a fact that children are going hungry in society and we will see more of it this summer. What the school meals programme has done is provide regular, routine and nutritious meals for children who need them. I know the Minister to be a decent politician, as is the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. This absolutely should not be an Opposition versus Government issue that is thrown over and back like a party political football. What I am asking the Minister to do is to be an ally in the call to extend this provision. I am asking him to commit to meeting with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection or her officials over the coming days and to make an announcement that the school meals programme will continue into July and August. It would be, at the most, a €10 million decision. This week, we assume, the current Administration will be going out of office. If it is one of the last decisions it makes to extend the school meals programme, it would be an extremely welcome one. The Minister, Deputy McHugh, and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection would be congratulated strongly right across the House for making that decision. The Minister has the get-out clause of being able to tell me that this is not a matter for his Department and it is somebody else's responsibility. I would like him to say that the point I am making is a valid one and that what INTO and the Children's Rights Alliance are saying about school meals are valid points. I would like the Minister to say also that he agrees with those valid points and that he will take them and do what he can over the coming days. If he were to say that much, it would be a fair thing for him to say. I think he appreciates the unfairness of a situation, to give an example from his own area, where children in Derry are getting school meals over the summer while children in Donegal are not, even though they are both going through the same pandemic and the same crisis. It does not make any sense. I am appealing to the Government to make the same decision that has been made in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. None of us wants a situation where families are struggling and having to make decisions on bills and so on which result in children going hungry. I know the Minister will appreciate that there is an absolutely bone-crushing and spirit-crushing humiliation that goes along with hunger. It is not just the lack of a meal but the lack of a future that goes with it. Resentment and anger can build into that and it really has a deeply wounding effect on the child who is hungry. I would appreciate the Minister' support on this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It feels almost as though a wartime Government has just been assembled. We meet here because 1,700 people have lost their lives as a result of a virus that has hit our country. That should remind us all of our collective endeavour to beat this virus and return the country to some level of normality. Politics can be a harsh business, it can be quite personal at times, and in that environment the country needs to see politics working better. That is why it is disappointing to hear words such as "betrayal" and even "hatred" mentioned earlier today. My party tries not to trade in hatred or division but to oppose the elements of what Government does that we feel are wrong and support what it does that we feel is right. I want the minds of Dáil Éireann to turn to the words of Thomas Johnson who, just over 100 years ago, wrote in the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil in 1919: "It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter". We are in Dublin's north inner city. The great thing that has liberated those who have been disadvantaged in this country has been education, but what has enslaved them has been inequality and drugs. This Government proposes two citizens' assemblies, one on education and one on drugs. I and my party say that if the Government is genuine about radically overhauling the education system, if it is going to treat the 17.9% of Irish adults who are functionally illiterate as a scandal and realise the 30% of children who leave disadvantaged schools have basic reading problems, if it is to understand the difference between one three year old and another is a 66% differential in their oral language capacity, and if it wants to tackle all those issues in its education citizens' assembly, then we will work with the Government and support it because we believe that education is the great liberator. However, what has enslaved working-class communities is the drug issue, which goes right across the land. It is the issue of addiction and the criminalisation of those in addition. Let us treat the drugs crisis as a health issue and use the resources of the State to tackle the drug gangs and not those who suffer from what they do. We will disagree on tax, the role of the State and its size, and on many other things, but if the Government's endeavour is to eradicate educational disadvantage and illiteracy, and to have a radical change in drug policy, then it will get agreement from the Labour Party on those areas. It is not about talking about betrayal or about hatred, it is about making politics work for people. There is so much that can be achieved in these Houses of the Oireachtas if we put aside the pre-written scripts and actually do something for the people who sent us here.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Tánaiste on his appointment and look forward to working with him over the coming period. His remarks are welcome for the emphasis he has placed on young people. I am glad the Government is aware of this. We have only just in recent memory come out of the last economic collapse, which was quite painful and bruising. Many small business owners will have just begun to look forward to the next period of their lives and their businesses' lives. They may have extended themselves on the feeling that things were improving economically and now they have been hit with this Covid disaster. It is much easier to retain a job than to create a new one. While we welcome this Bill and note that it is enabling legislation, there are elements to the microfinancing project that could be enhanced and improved. Comparisons have been made with the bounce back microfinance operation in the UK. The bounce back scheme makes loans available at 2.5% with no repayment for a year. The Government pays the first year's interest. The loans are 100% State guaranteed. Loans of up to 25% of turnover are available with a term limit of six years and a maximum of £50,000. In the Republic, Microfinance Ireland offers a six-month interest fee repayment holiday, a term limit of three years and a maximum of €50,000. The Labour Party's suggestion is that €50,000 is inadequate and could be increased to €100,000. The interest rate of 4% is considered to be too expensive. In previous times, when the State was getting financing at somewhere similar to that rate, it could be in some way justified, but finance is available to the State now at a much-reduced rate and it would follow that a much-reduced interest rate should be applicable here. The term limit of three years is quite short compared with the UK bounce back scheme term of six years. We would like to give businesses a sense that they have five or seven years or maybe longer ahead of them to recoup and start afresh. Before Covid, we had very encouraging employment statistics and the economy appeared to be going in the right direction. However, the statistics and economic analysis have clouded the reality of being a low-pay economy. About 23% of Irish workers pre-Covid were in low pay according to OECD statistics. That is a very large figure, as the Tánaiste can appreciate. As has been said, about 40% of young people were in insecure work. Those sectors of low-paid and insecure work were the ones most affected by Covid. We in the Labour Party feel that we cannot return to that type of economic model which is so dependent on low pay and insecure work. We want to work with the Government to provide a better and more secure model for workers. It is much appreciated that the Tánaiste outlined the youth unemployment element in his address. We feel that this will at least be a significant part of the July stimulus. James Doorley from the National Youth Council of Ireland gave a statistic over the weekend that 45% of young people under 30 years are currently in unemployment. That is a staggering and incredibly worrying figure. We have all seen the damage the last economic collapse caused. We have potential now with support from lenders not to make the same entrenched and damaging mistakes that many of us made ten years ago and in the years after that. We appreciate and support the Bill, but if we look at what is happening in other European states and the UK, there are other models that are probably more generous. We could make this much more generous. I have spoken about the interest rate, term limits and amounts involved.Unemployment is not just an economic cost or a statistic that we try to bring down, as the Tánaiste knows, it is a real human cost to the person's sense of worth to his or her family and to society. We cannot reduce it to economic terminology. We will support the Bill but we feel it must be more flexible and give voice to the fact that we are in a very precarious economic situation, and that is without mentioning Brexit. The debate until now has focused on Covid, and justifiably so. Covid has given rise to a health crisis that has caused economic collapse. While, Brexit has an influence on identity, security and other matters, including the Good Friday Agreement, it is also an economic threat. With both of those things, we also have an unemployment crisis. That is why we feel that Microfinance Ireland requires a greater capacity to lend larger amounts at lower rates over a longer period to those businesses which probably only turned the corner a few years ago in order that they can stand on their own two feet. I emphasise that we cannot return to the model of low pay and the grinding, humiliating existence that too many of our workers endure. That 23% of workers are on low pay is a damning statistic. It is not something over which we can stand or to which we would want to return. If, as my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly said, so many people are in insecure work, that must also be challenged. There are many mechanisms we can use to challenge that but it is an economic model to which we do not want to return. I want something that is better not only for the economy but also for society in general. The Labour Party will support the Bill and I look forward to the Tánaiste's response to the points which have been raised.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. During the general election held a few short months ago housing was the biggest issue arising on the doorsteps. In terms of affordability, it was far too common to come across a number of generations of one family living under the same roof, with people priced out of starting a life, with relationship break-up putting a huge strain on families and with people wondering what life chance they had to live in the area I represent, although this is a national issue as well. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing this evening. The Labour Party Private Members' time tomorrow evening will focus on housing as well. This evening, we are focused on the issue of affordable housing. The Minister mentioned in his contribution that he proposes to initiate an affordable purchase scheme and he mentioned that he would welcome practical and positive suggestions. In this regard, I refer the Minister to the former rent-to-buy scheme. The Minister will recall that prior to the crash a number of housing schemes were in place during the late 2008 to 2010 period in particular, which afforded people an opportunity to get on the property ladder but these schemes were disbanded when the crash happened. The rent-to-buy scheme was operated by Dublin City Council and Louth County Council. A similar scheme operated in Northern Ireland. I would like to speak to the scheme operated by Dublin City Council. Under this scheme a person entered into a three-year agreement with the council to rent at an agreed monthly rent of up to 20% less than the market rate in a particular area. If the person decided to purchase the property, 80% of the rent paid over the three years, or a shorter term but up to a maximum of three years, was offset against the purchase price, this price having been agreed before the tenant moved into the accommodation. One of the benefits of the rent-to-buy scheme was that a person had three years to decide if he or she wanted to buy the property, to continue to rent it or to walk away. This gave people an opportunity not to have to rent and save simultaneously. These are the couples and individuals all of us meet who cannot afford to rent and save for a deposit at the same time and so they feel completely locked out. What we need now is a scheme such that people do not have to rent and save at the same time. Such a scheme existed pre-2010. The Labour Party is suggesting that the Minister recommence that scheme, but nationally rather than in any one local authority area. As I said, a similar scheme is operated in Northern Ireland, known as the rent-to-own scheme. Under this scheme a person signs a tenancy agreement, the rent-to-own co-operative buys the property selected by the rent-to-own applicant and it rents it to the tenant at market rent. The tenant then has an option to buy at the end of three-year fixed term. To qualify, a person must be able to show that he or she can make the repayments and does not have an alternative route into home ownership. The Labour Party proposal is practical and it should be taken on board to address the situation for the locked out generation. It is a proposal we could work on collectively across the House. As I said, schemes of this type were in place prior to the crash. When the crash came, over a short period a huge amount of property became much more affordable to people of a certain income stream if they were still in employment.  These are the types of schemes we need to revert to. The State should be happy to get involved. I do not understand the reluctance of successive Governments to have the hand of the State hugely, if not solely, involved in the provision of housing. The State does not have a profit motive. The issue with housing when it is left to the market is that the market has no conscience and it has a profit motive. If the State is involved it does not have a profit motive and there are standards that we can expect from the State and those who oversee the agencies of the State, be they local authorities or Departments. We would have more faith in councils, local authorities or direct funding from Departments to drive these schemes. Those who could avail of these schemes would have much more faith in them because they would know that in a private rented market situation they would not end up on the rough end of a tenancy agreement if things did not go their way. People can trust the State more than the market economy. On that basis, tomorrow night we will flesh out other issues the Labour Party has in terms of the housing situation. As I said, when I was canvassing a rent-to-buy scheme was a measure many couples said they could potentially buy into. People should not have to rent and save at the same time. The two can happen simultaneously with tenants being given a three-year timeframe within which to make a decision. This would give people a level of comfort for a set timeframe. It also would not put a huge emotional strain on a relationship or an emotional strain on a family that just wants to move on and live their lives.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That Dáil Éireann:recognises:— the exceptional circumstances of Covid-19;— the necessity of shutting down non-essential economic activity to prevent the spread of viral infection and to save thousands of lives;— the loss of income suffered by many households, through no fault of their own, notwithstanding extraordinary measures taken to offset these;— that many households will have been unable to keep up with rent or mortgage payments during the period of lockdown;— that accumulated debt from rent or mortgage payments will suddenly crystallise for many households once the economy reopens and current exceptional protections are removed; and— that the ban on rent increases and evictions during the pandemic has led to a decrease in the number of people presenting as homeless; andcalls on the Government to:— ensure that no one becomes homeless or suffers penalty charges due to an inability to meet rent or mortgage payments during the lockdown period;— introduce an extended moratorium on rent increases and evictions until there is sufficient supply of new housing;— ensure there is a specific provision in law to protect people threatened with eviction due to rent or mortgage arrears accrued during the pandemic;— establish a State scheme to substantially reduce rent-related debt that has accrued through no fault of households who were unable to pursue their livelihoods during the period of lockdown;— stop the banks from charging penalties or surcharges on mortgage arrears accrued during the pandemic; and— clearly state what other actions the Government will take to alleviate the situation of housing-related debt caused by the Covid-19 lockdown on the economy.Tá mé ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Teachta Nash. The Minister will know that during the general election, which feels like an awfully long time ago, housing was one of the issues most often raised on doorsteps. While the Covid-19 pandemic has taken many people's minds off the housing crisis in this State, in many ways it has just pulled a plaster over the reality of housing need in this country. We wish to speak about those who rent and those who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. I know that the Minister will appreciate that we have had a dysfunctional housing market for many years. In a European context, Ireland depends disproportionately on the private sector. As we have said and will continue to say for as long as anyone is willing to hear us, the market has no conscience. The private sector has a profit motive. As such, we should not allow people in housing need to depend on the market or rely disproportionately on the private sector. We in the Labour Party strongly believe that the State has to take its role seriously. The State should provide housing and those who are renting should be able to depend on the State to have their backs. The Labour Party has some very simple suggestions. Last night I spoke about the need for a rent-to-buy scheme. It is impossible for young couples or individuals to rent and save simultaneously. We have had such schemes in the past and the State should support them in the future. Unfortunately, there has been a sense in recent years that the State, the Government or the Department do not want to intervene in the market. We have to intervene. It has been shown time and time again that the market fails consistently when it comes to housing people. We should not go through another of the cycles we have witnessed in the past 20 years or so.  The Labour Party wants the Minister to agree to a State support scheme for rental arrears; legal protection from eviction because of rent or mortgage arrears; an extension of the moratorium on rent increases and evictions; and a ban on bank penalties for mortgage arrears. My colleagues will speak about other areas. I wish to speak about the need for a State support scheme for rental arrears. I want to outline to the Minister who renters are. Before I touch on that, I again remind the Minister that we have a low-pay economy. That is what we have constructed. That is what this economic recovery is based upon. As my colleague, Deputy Nash, frequently reminds this House, 23% of Irish workers were in low-paid work before Covid-19 according to the OECD. About 40% of people under the age of 30 are in insecure work. Someone on low pay can only get accommodation of a low standard. If someone is in insecure work, his or her accommodation is also insecure. The labour market, the rental market and the housing market are interlinked and we cannot divorce them. I will speak about the State support scheme for rental arrears that we want and why we want it. Let us think about younger workers, to whom I have already alluded. Younger workers are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 lay-offs. Approximately 60% of those aged 18 to 19 are out of work and 47% of those aged 20 to 24 are out of work. Over the weekend Mr. James Doorley of the National Youth Council noted that youth unemployment in Ireland now stands at 45%. Younger workers are also much more likely to live in rented accommodation. Some 30% of those aged between 20 and 24 and 42% of those aged between 25 and 34 are renting. Job losses have also occurred in sectors where a large number of workers rent. Renters account for 38% of workers in the accommodation and food sectors, 28% of workers in the administration and support sector, 27% of retail workers, 23% of those who work in the arts, and 21% of those who work in construction. Huge numbers of people whose lives and livelihoods have been hugely affected by the current crisis are in rented accommodation. Around 200,000 renters are in the sectors most severely affected by job losses. Essentials make up about 40% of a renter's total spending. The comparable figure for owner-occupiers is just 36%. Renters lead a more difficult life. They are less able to weather storms, including this one. Are we going to leave them to the market and the private sector or are we going to provide them with the protection of the State? That is where the Minister comes in. Departmental figures from May show that the number of people who are in debt, are renting and have low-paid jobs is still very high. As I have outlined, low-skilled and low-wage jobs are disproportionately held by young people, migrant workers and female workers. There is an equality dimension to this. Supports such as interest-free loans or tax credits for renters are necessary to alleviate debt built up as a result of job losses. This is going to last for years. While we may come out of the immediate health crisis, its effects are going to last for quite a long time, as the Minister knows. Threshold has created a profile of the renters impacted by Covid-19. Younger single people make up about 60% of the callers seeking assistance from Threshold. Some 69% of those calling have reported losing their homes as a result of Covid-19. Many callers did not know about rent supplements. If a tenant leaves a house share, the remaining tenants become liable for larger rents. There has been a significant increase in queries regarding arrears. Couples and families are disproportionately affected and one-parent families experience a secondary effect. In putting forward this motion, we are outlining very clearly to the Minister that the demographic in question, namely, people who rent, was already suffering under the economic model we have pursued. We are living in an economy where a disproportionate amount of the income people accrue is spent on accommodation. I think the Minister will acknowledge that. As I understand it, nowhere else in Europe is as high a portion of people's income spent on accommodation by way of either mortgages or rent. We are now in a situation where the collapse in employment is disproportionately affecting those who have been renting. Those people need protections from the State against the excesses of the market, which has no conscious, and the excesses of the private sector, which has a profit motive. That is where the Minister comes in. My colleague, Deputy Nash, will touch on other issues and we would appreciate the Minister's feedback on all of them. The last thing we need in this Dáil is for Labour Party Deputies or any other Members to come into the Chamber to give valid suggestions only for the Minister to do what Governments have traditionally done, which is to put down an amendment and we all walk away having achieved nothing. Our objective is that people who are witnessing their lives falling apart can look at this Parliament and see a group of people who are working for them and not just playing the game. We in the Labour Party have no interest in playing the game. Our interest is in representing people, getting things over the line and setting up schemes that will affect people's lives in a positive way. All of those things are in the gift of the Minister. We want to know whether he is going to stand by the State or stand by the market. Will he stand by the public sector and public provision of housing or will he stand by private provision, which, as we have seen, has failed time and time again? We very much want the Minister to deal with our motion in the spirit in which it is presented. We are solutions-driven and we are not here to play games. We are here to find real housing solutions for the people of this country.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the same matter, I wish to have placed on the record of the House the Minister's intentions in terms of dealing with the High Court decision on sectoral employment orders, outside of appealing to the Supreme Court. Are there legislative proposals from his Department? The Minister indicated to my colleague that he does not have any legislative proposals but I ask him to clarify that and to justify it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If one is in employment that is governed by a sectoral employment order, one will feel particularly insecure currently, in conjunction with how insecure one might feel because of Covid and the fact that in living memory we had an economic crash less than a decade ago. We have lived in a low-wage economy for some years. I stated to the Minister previously - the Labour Party wishes to repeats the point - that statistics provided by the OECD show that 23% of workers are on low pay. Last week, my colleague, Deputy Nash, introduced the Industrial Relations (Sectoral Employment Orders) Confirmation Bill 2020. If the Minister were to support the legislation or to bring in similar legislation, he would be signalling to these workers that he has their backs and he is on their side. I have been in these Houses long enough to know that when a Government needs or wants to do something, it sends out a message. It is able to do so, regardless of what commentators might say or whether its constitutionality might be questioned. What sort of signal would the Minister give in terms of a legislative response? Just as the Labour Party has done with its Bill, could the Minister not do something similar in order to show the workers that he does have their backs and that he is not just going to wait for the outcome of a case before the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is all about intent and how strongly one believes in these things. This is legislation that has been proposed by a former Minister in this area, who brought in the 2015 legislation to which the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, referred in an earlier comment. It is not a case of playing games or doing something for the sake of it; it is legislation that has identified the issues raised in the court case and is trying to iron them out. What I suggest is that the Minister could support the Bill or give it proper consideration and bring in his own legislation while we wait on the Supreme Court to rule on the case. It jars with me and my party, and probably with others, to hear the Minister congratulate himself on taking the case to the Supreme Court. If the Minister were not to take the case to the Supreme Court, we would definitely see which side of the fence he is on. In the meantime, while we wait for the stimulus package and for the outcome of the Supreme Court case, it is the responsibility of the Government to show there is nothing the Government will not do or entertain in order to protect people who are covered by SEOs, who by their very nature are in vulnerable work, and are open to exploitation. That is the reason for the necessity of SEOs. This is the type of message we need from the Government. I appreciate that the Minister said he will examine the legislation that has been produced by the Labour Party, but I wish to hear a harder and more supportive message than that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank and congratulate the Social Democrats for putting forward this motion, which the Labour Party will be supporting. We absolutely reject the amendment put down by the Government. I will refer to that in a moment. I would like everybody listening to this debate to pause for a second and realise where we are. We are in the north inner city in the geographical birthplace of the workers' rights movement in Ireland. We are in the shadow of Liberty Hall and we are within walking distance of where Jim Larkin once spoke to striking dockers. It is possible to take a trip down Henry Street and see the plaque commemorating where the Dunnes Stores' women, they were predominantly women, went on strike in the 1980s. This is not a history lesson of course because, as has been referred to, the Debenhams' workers are just the latest example of how the struggle for workers' rights continues. I find the amendment put down by the Government to be an insult. It is an insult to what the Social Democrats' motion is attempting to achieve, an insult to those who believe in workers' rights and an insult to those who have struggled for long years to obtain workers' rights and to enshrine those in legislation. I am not, however, surprised, because the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, actually insulted myself, my party and our efforts to deal with the High Court judgment only yesterday when he said that what we were engaging in was "virtue signalling". That is what he said and this is the same individual who, when launching his Fine Gael leadership campaign three years ago, stated that he intended to introduce legislation to ban those in the public sector who work in essential services from striking. This is the type of political ethic with which we are dealing with the Tánaiste. That was enough to get some political support for his candidacy for the leadership of the Fine Gael Party three years ago and yet these are the same essential workers that he was happy to applaud during this pandemic and to state that without them our country would have fallen apart. That is classic dog-whistling. The Labour Party and other parties in the Oireachtas have gone to great lengths to introduce legislation to improve the lot of workers in Ireland in recent years and that legislation has been rejected by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. I refer to the Industrial Relations (Joint Labour Committees) Bill 2019 put forward last year by then Senator and now Deputy Nash. That Bill was rejected by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The Protection of Employment (Measures to Counter False Self Employment) Bill 2017, put forward in June 2019, was again galling because the Government at that time stated that it would introduce its own bogus self-employment legislation and yet there is no sign of it a year later. The issue here is that bogus self-employment actually cheats us all. I go back again to the Tánaiste's political ethic. When it comes to welfare, he is quite happy to put on the side of a bus a sign saying "Welfare cheats cheat us all". Bogus self-employment costs this country hundreds of millions of euro each year because of losses in PRSI, yet nothing was done about it in respect of the legislation which we introduced and a commitment was not lived up to. Regarding workers' rights, we live in a low-pay, low-tax economy. We live in an economy where, before Covid-19 hit, 23% of Irish workers were on statistical low pay. That is an OECD figure. It is a scandal and it is a statistic that should shame us all, because living on a low wage is humiliating. It grinds people down, burrows into the marrow of their bones and could stay with them for life. As has been referred to by my colleagues in the Social Democrats, it is disproportionately migrant workers and women who are affected. Of course, low pay is, naturally enough, unprotected by collective bargaining rights. That is because we have some of the weakest collective bargaining rights in Europe. Inevitably, an employer that has a veto on collective bargaining negotiations has no interest in lifting up the 23% of our entire workforce who are in low pay. This is not just a low-pay issue, because 40% of young people under 30 years of age are in insecure work. Insecure employment leads to insecure accommodation which in turn leads to insecurity in a whole range of other areas of life, including educational prospects. That is the economy to which the Government is telling us that it is hoping to return. With the greatest of respect to the Minister of State and what he is trying to achieve, suggesting that welfare cheats cheat us all but that bogus self-employment is not something we need to worry about immediately is wrong. I suggest to him as well that anybody who stands in front of a microphone and states that it is necessary to introduce legislation to ban those in the public sector who work in essential services from striking has not got a clue what he is talking about and should not have the gall some years later to applaud those same workers when they are saving lives. I also want the Government to recognise that we have a low pay economy within which we need collective bargaining rights. If it is unconstitutional to have this - I imagine the Attorney General will advise the Government that it is the case - then let us have a constitutional referendum and a citizens' assembly on the matter. The Government is justifiably organising an assembly in respect of the drugs issue and education. A task force has been recommended by the Social Democrats. We could go with that. If a constitutional referendum is required to change the Constitution to allow for collective bargaining rights and to break the employer veto, then let us go with it. I put it to the Minister of State that for the Tánaiste, the Minister who is in charge of this area, to stand in Dáil Éireann and accuse members of the Labour Party or any other party of virtue signalling because we introduced legislation to protect those who need legislative protection is beneath him, his ministerial office and the dignity of this Government. This is especially the case since the people are looking to the Government for help, support and protection. What the Social Democrats are proposing and what Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and others are supporting is not virtue signalling. It is about workers rights and the ongoing struggle. I really hoped that the Government produced a better and more thought-out amendment than the effective insult it has brought forward this evening.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have a number of comments to make. I wish the various Ministers well and hope to work with them. I feel very strongly about access to education and educational disadvantage and I congratulate the Minister on announcing a new free book scheme. A pilot scheme was included in the budget last year, proposed in the programme for Government, and has now been delivered upon. A total of 102 schools will avail of a free book scheme in September, and that is the kind of initiative on which the Labour Party wants to work with the Government to roll out throughout the country. I congratulate the Minister on that. I want to ask a very direct question. It has come to my attention that the Department has now conceded that the leaving certificate results will not now be announced until the first week in September. Is the Minister in a position to confirm this? If that is the situation, what preparations is the Department making for this eventuality? The assumption heretofore was that the leaving certificate results would become available on pretty much the same date as they always have. However, if it is to happen in the first week of September, if that is the situation, and if the Department is working towards that end, what impact is that going to have on third level institutions, apart from the mental health strain on the young people going through this process who have already been extremely challenged? If that is the situation, will the Minister clarify that and give a commitment that, one hopes, that is not the case and that the leaving certificate results will be published at the same time as was expected, in mid-August?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask that time be made available today or tomorrow for statements to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley. I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle on Friday on foot of an exchange I had with the Minister on Thursday when I asked her a very straight question about the leaving certificate results. The Minister refused to answer the question and then sent out a press release some two hours later. That was disrespectful to the Dáil and to the Ceann Comhairle. I ask that the Minister for Education and Skills be made available today or tomorrow to answer questions on the leaving certificate and the reasons the issuing of the results has been delayed. There will be no other opportunity in the coming days for us to do this. I believe the Minister disrespected the House last Thursday and I feel that it is incumbent on the Government to give Opposition spokespersons an opportunity to question the Minister in this House on this important issue, which will affect so many families in September.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Many of my comments on this will repeat what I have said on the microfinance Bill and the Private Members' motion on workers' rights last week. The Labour Party will support this Bill. We appreciate the necessity for it and where the Minister is coming from in bringing it to the House. We agree with some of the comments made by previous speakers, particularly on the lifting of the portfolio cap. The Minister of State's opening remarks placed a heavy emphasis on the July stimulus package. The Labour Party published its own draft stimulus proposals last week. We have tests for every piece of legislation which comes to either House in trying to deal with the massive impact which Covid-19 has had on our country and our economy. We all appreciate the economy has fallen off a cliff. In many respects it is different from what happened ten years ago in that there will still be a capacity issue regardless of how much we can reopen and how much people are able to spend again. Many small and medium-sized enterprises will have capacity issues around the number of customers they can cater for. We know that it is easier to retain a job than create one, so whatever we try to do, whether in microfinancing or credit guarantees, the goal is to maintain jobs that already exist. All measures that we take must be big enough to counteract the impact not only of Covid-19 but also of Brexit. I wonder if Members of this House or people around the country are as cognisant of the impact of Brexit as they are of Covid-19, which is something that we are living with and thinking about. It is creating a huge mental health issue for the whole country, but had it not arrived, we would absolutely be talking about Brexit instead, its impact and the actions of the UK Government around it. The potential for job losses in Border counties and the south east is huge in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The impact on jobs, businesses and household finances will be huge. The Labour Party recommended a package of about €10 billion. If reports are to be believed, the Government is suggesting a package of €7 billion, so there is a gap between the two proposed figures, but the hole in the public finances must be bridged somewhere, which is why we believe that any stimulus, legislation or initiative must be big and bold to recognise the magnitude of what we are dealing with. The stimulus must be directed at the creation of good quality jobs, especially for younger workers. We believe there must be conditionality with all these measures. I recognise what the previous speaker said about workers' rights, that it must be based in legislation and trade union recognition, and that it cannot be based on a quid pro quo, which I accept. At the same time, it is important that we do not return to the old economic model which failed so many people. I will keep using these statistics as long as I have a platform to speak about them, which are that 23% of Irish workers are on low pay and 40% of young people are in insecure work. The old model was not working for many young people. Now 45% of young people are unemployed. We have one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe. That must be recognised in any stimulus package, legislation or measures to build up the economy again. We need good quality jobs that will last and not ones that are insecure. Insecure employment leads to insecure accommodation and insecurities in many life choices. We need a new economic model based on lifelong learning, caring and sustainability. These measures must be aimed at reducing economic inequality which must be an overarching aim. During a crisis, crisis measures are taken without thinking long term. Many of us fear that we might support this legislation, but many Bills or packages and announcements are made in the white heat of the crisis. We appreciate that and governments have to respond, but there are massive long-term impacts from the short-term measures that are taken or the big announcements that are made. If whatever announcement is made adds to economic inequality, it must be resisted and rethought. None of us on this side of the House is trying to be difficult or not help do whatever we can to get the country out of the difficulty we find ourselves in, but we cannot then return to an unfair and unequal economic model based on low tax and low pay. That is not something we should stand over. We should not be shy about demanding the strengthening of our public services. Many business leaders speak about the challenges they have with rents, rates and so on, which is all understandable. However, when we talk about rate cuts or holidays, we must remember that rates are vital funding streams to local authorities. I am in no way suggesting that there should not be movement on rates - there should and there has been, which is welcome - but those funds need to be replaced because local councils depend on them. The Minister of State might suggest that local councils are overdependent on ratepayers and business, which is arguable, but the funding must be replaced because there must be funding for services to provide public housing, parks, playgrounds, libraries and the other council services that everyone depends on so much. While we are trying to reboot the economy and ensure that businesses can survive, it will be challenging for local councils to survive if the rates they are used to obtaining from business to fund their services are no longer available. Those are the Labour Party's five tests on the July stimulus: that it is big enough to make an impact - we suggest €10 billion; that it creates good quality jobs for young workers, because 45% are unemployed and a huge proportion of them were in insecure work prior to the Covid crash; that it should be based on a new economic model of decent and secure jobs; that it reduces economic inequality; and that it improves public services. Having said all of that, the Labour Party will be supporting this Bill. We have a strong track record in producing legislation that can be practical and that can work. However, we constantly make the point to the Minister of State and the senior Minister, when he takes legislation through the House, that we are long-standing critics of any economic model which lets employers, a Government or an economy get away with exploiting people or that allows an economy or a Government to build a recovery on the backs of those who cannot stand up for themselves. It is younger people, women and migrants, disproportionately, who are in these low-paid insecure jobs. These people are also disproportionately affected by the rent issue. All of these matters overlap and are interconnected. The people I speak of do not have access to mainstream media or to powerful lobby groups that can speak on their behalf. If they happen to join a union, the union has a veto. The thing about industrial relations in Ireland is that it has been described as similar to joining a golf club. One can join the golf club but one does not necessarily get to play. That is the reality of the volunteerist model of industrial relations that exists here and that we will be challenging over for the next number of years in order to ensure that workers have a chance to recover as the economy recovers. We want to see businesses recover and enterprises survive and to see the development of an Ireland that can get out of these dark days. We fully understand that many businesses were only beginning to turn the corner in the wake of the previous crash and believe in themselves again, and were, perhaps, taking on additional employees, building extensions or opening new outlets. We completely understand that many people have been devastated not just by the collapse of the economy caused by Covid-19 but also by the fact that the dreams that they had up until Christmas have been destroyed. Many feel that they may not open their doors again. We want to support the Bill and what the Government is trying to achieve but we cannot – we will be consistent on this - say that if we go back to the way matters were before Christmas, everything will be fine. That will not be the case. A great number of people are suffering in desperate conditions. These are people who are working. That is what is so disappointing when one hears statistics regarding the level of unemployment being down and full employment being achieved in the country. It is the type of employment that exists and the desperation in which people can live which is clouded by these unemployment figures. Those are my comments on the Bill, which we are not opposing. I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State further on it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing the motion to the floor of the House. It gives us all an opportunity to speak on this issue and for the Government to respond. Like many parties, the Labour Party has met with the Debenhams workers. Senator Sherlock and I met with some of these courageous workers and their representatives in Mandate trade union today. It is important for Irish society, and what is sometimes called "middle Ireland", to understand the magnitude of a decision which a worker makes to engage in industrial action of the scale taken by the Debenhams workers. Sometimes I do not get the sense that middle Ireland or people who have not grown up in the tradition of labour or activism in industrial disputes understand how huge a commitment it is to engage in this type of industrial action or protest. It is draining, exhausting, it occupies every waking moment of one's brain. It sucks in the entire family and is all a person can possibly think or talk about. Initial camaraderie and even gaiety during the first days when there is a huge level of collective endeavour can sometimes wane. One can imagine the mental strain on a person 100 days into a dispute. All people grasp for is a tiny bit of hope that they might get somewhere.  The problem is that we have been here before. As others have observed, it happened with Clerys and with HMV. The market has no conscience. We cannot expect the market to self-regulate, or to deal with the level of conscience, it will not because the market does not have one. It deals in profit and money, and those they employ to make the money are expendable.  As a result of the Clerys scenario, my colleague, Deputy Nash, and Deputy Bruton commissioned a report for the Government which was published in 2017. It was written by Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy. The Duffy Cahill report made recommendations and it is only reasonable that the Government should implement them so that, regardless of how we get through this together, we do not have another one of these incidents in a number of months time, because this is what businesses always do. They will manipulate whatever mechanisms they can and screw over whoever they possibly can for their own short-term gain. Someone who has worked for 25 or 30 years is only expendable.  I met with the workers today. They spoke of their exhaustion, but also how resolute they are. I want to remind Debenhams, which is possibly watching this debate, that we see them. We see the Government and its response but we know that Debenhams.ie is still trading. I ask Irish consumers to use their power as consumers when it comes to clicking on Debenhams.ie. The Tánaiste, who is the senior Minister, met the workers and their representatives in Mandate today. We support the motion, will vote for it tomorrow and we congratulate those who put it forward, but it is likely to fail because that is what happens in this over-and-back Private Members' business, where Government Deputies vote down Opposition motions. That is the way of it. However, based on the Tánaiste's meeting with the workers today there is a sense that there is a way forward. I appeal to the better nature of Government representatives. Rather than walking away from tonight's debate or tomorrow's vote and hoping it goes away, I ask them to use the goodwill of what workers and their representatives presented. The Government should continue in that vein and use the mechanisms outlined today which are at the Government's disposal to find a resolution to this issue. There is enough goodwill in Government to do this.  I appreciate those of us in opposition like to characterise Government parties in a particular way and we will do that. I have done it and will do it again. However, one cannot play politics with people's livelihood, lives and futures. If there is an opportunity for the Government to do something decent and right for these workers I ask that it please do so. If the Government does so, it should be commended. However, we cannot wait for the next Debenhams, Clerys or HMV to happen in a few months, as it inevitably will. Let us be as fair as we can. If the Government takes what was said today to the maximum of what can be done, it will be in sight of a resolution.The workers are within sight of a resolution and it is something that we can all possibly be happy with. We cannot be happy that the legislative underpinning of industrial relations in this country allows this to continue to happen. We have to implement this report. If we do that, all of us can feel that we are achieving something rather than coming in, making a speech, walking out and feeling that we have done enough. That is the Labour Party’s position. Let us do the right thing for the workers and take the goodwill of today to the next stage. This can be done. I hope these words of mine are not repeated to me in a week’s time as if I am being incredibly naive. Next week or in ten days' time, I do not want to be seen to be incredibly naive because I jumped on the possibility arising from the Minister's decision to open a door for these workers. Time is short and August will be a dead month for politics and the media. The workers know the opportunity to have something done by the Government will last until the end of the month. I am pleading with the Minister, on behalf of these workers, to do the right thing in the next ten days and to ensure that when the Dáil returns, we can start the process of implementing the Duffy Cahill report and working collaboratively to ensure we do not have another Debenhams, Clerys or HMV.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to ask the Minister about the strategic housing development Act brought in by the previous Government and if he is conducting a review of that Act. I understand that Act and its provisions are to continue until mid-2022.It is controversial legislation. It overrides local authorities and their planning processes and has led to much upset and controversy in local communities. I want to get a sense from the Minister of the plan of the Government to renew the terms of the Act.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am glad to hear the Minister say that because he was quite vocal in his constituency on this matter. Fianna Fáil representatives in my constituency were very concerned about this legislation on the basis that it was not doing what it was designed to do because a number of planning cases ended up in the High Court and it was overriding the powers of the local authority. When something overrides a local authority, it overrides the democratically constituted development plan of the city. As people know, councillors have limited powers but one of the powers they do have is to put together a development plan, which includes zonings. If legislation can override that and people can go directly to An Bord Pleanála for developments comprising more than 100 units, this means that An Bord Pleanála does not have to be bound as rigidly by the zonings, which has led to a lot of controversy about certain lands which are zoned in a particular way. I know the Minister will appreciate that. I want him to reaffirm his commitment that he will not extend SHD legislation beyond the date he has indicated.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is crucially important for local democracy that people elect their local councillors and that those councillors oversee the development plan, the running of the city and zonings. The latter are there for particular reasons, namely, to protect open spaces and build communities which can thrive into the future and which people can live in and enjoy. Councillors and council planners are there to oversee a city, county or area that works. The legislation to which I refer is particularly destructive in that regard. I am glad the Minister has recognised that and that we can work together to ensure that it will not be renewed. We will hold the Minister to that commitment because we do not want him to change his mind six months or a year from now.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will the Minister set out his views on shared housing, which is another controversial scheme initiated by the previous Government? Is there a review of that scheme under way, particularly in light of the fact that Covid-19 means that such accommodation will be completely inappropriate into the future?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In many aspects of Irish life, Covid-19 has ripped off the plaster. If it has particularly exposed any one issue in Irish society, it has been in regard to housing and how people are living. If we ask people to stay at home as a national call, then we have to be mindful of how people live. If they are living in overcrowded accommodation, if three generations are living in the one house, if people do not have access to a back garden, then all of the things for which people have been criticised for campaigning on over the years are now seen to have been valid complaints. The Minister says that no co-living accommodation has been built and that may be true, but he must be aware that planning permissions have been granted for such accommodation. What is his and his Department's intention in regard to this reality?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We do not want to have death by review.What is the timescale for the completion of the review? All the while, planning applications are being submitted and permission is being granted, which leads to a bigger problem. If the review and Government action are swift, we will avoid the construction of a significant number of co-living accommodation units with which we would then have to contend. In light of the possibility of a second wave or having to deal with Covid for several years, it would be absolutely irresponsible to suggest that anybody should live in this way. It was a bad idea before Covid because it is not an ethical housing policy. There is no dignity attached to it. It makes money for some people but it is not the way we should be building communities. I think the Minister agrees with me in that regard. When will the review be completed? If the Government is serious about doing something on this issue, when will it act?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«For the information of the House, I tabled these questions in conjunction with Senator Moynihan, the Labour Party spokesperson on housing. I ask the Minister to provide details of the land transferred to the Land Development Agency, LDA, for the development of residential units; and the projects it is considering for development, including details of the partners involved, the number of expected units, the stage of the process and the target completion dates.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. I appreciate that he will circulate the tabular information. I refer to the potential for different housing models. I made reference to this issue while speaking to the Sinn Féin motion on affordable housing. I acknowledge that the Minster spoke about affordable purchase previously. We previously discussed the idea of a rent-to-buy scheme and the Minister stated he would look into it. There is potential within the LDA model for that type of scheme to be pursued. We previously discussed the scheme that was abandoned ten years ago when the crash came but which had helped certain families. The current situation is that couples and individuals in Dublin and elsewhere cannot rent and save at the same time. If they are renting, that uses up all their disposable income and they cannot save for a deposit. Is there potential within the LDA model for a rent-to-buy scheme? I previously discussed the details of such a scheme. It could involve three years of rental, after which one would have a chance to put the rent paid towards a deposit, to keep renting or to leave the scheme. Is that type of model something the Minister could consider within the framework of his proposals?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Can we weave that sort of model into the LDA legislation or should it be provided for in stand-alone legislation that allows for various models to be pursued? It is a model that worked in the past. It will deal with a particular issue. As I previously mentioned, throughout the country there are several generations living in the same house. Part of the problem is the lost generation of people in their 20s or 30s who are living at home. They cannot afford to rent because they are saving to get onto the property ladder. Is it possible to be prescriptive within the LDA legislation in the context of dealing with this issue? Can the legislation provide for dealing with various housing schemes that we wish for the LDA to pursue or is it just going to be enabling legislation which will allow us latitude to pursue various housing models such as the rent-to-buy scheme about which we are so passionate?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party will be opposing the Bill and submitting a number of amendments. We feel that this Bill has limited protections for those impacted by Covid-19. It seems strange, when a measure introduced in March has been seen to work to keep people out of homelessness, that we would change the provisions that were made. Homelessness and housing have dogged political debate for years now. They are one of the greatest crises we have had to grapple with as a nation. Measures have finally been taken that have seen a drop in the numbers presenting, but now we are changing the very provisions that saw these numbers drop. Because of this legislation, we can be sure that we will now see an increase in homelessness in the autumn. The Government must prepare for that reality because this flawed Bill will not stop people losing their homes. Unfortunately, we are going to have a debate in the autumn when we will point to this moment and say to the Minister that we told him. I presume the Minister will use devices or excuses to explain why the Opposition is wrong and he is right. I hope we are wrong and he is right. There is nothing from experience to suggest that will be the case. The pandemic ban on evictions clearly worked to stop the increase in homelessness. Under this Bill, no-fault evictions are back, substantial renovation evictions are back and evictions for the benefit of family members are back. There is no beefing up of the staffing of the RTB for inspections and protections of renters in such cases. Let us be clear about the type of people who will be most affected by these measures and the type of people who are renting in our economy. A huge number of them are younger workers who have been most seriously affected by the economic collapse. Some 30% of 20 to 24 year olds and 42% of 25 to 34 year olds are renting. The job losses in sectors where large numbers of workers rent are as follows: 38% in accommodation and food; 28% in administration and support; 27% in retail; 23% in arts; and 21% in construction. These are massive job losses in areas of the economy where a huge section of workers rent. About 200,000 renters are in sectors most severely affected by job losses.Unfortunately, the proposed law leaves too many exceptions in the terms of evictions and there is a significant risk that, from September, we will see homelessness rising again. The changes will only give protection from eviction until January to those who can prove that they have been financially impacted upon by a limited set of circumstances and will put in place a complicated process to apply for that exception. It is important to re-emphasise the point that the Bill does not take into account in any adequate way those who have addiction issues or mental health challenges or those with lower levels of literacy. We live in a country where 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate. This means that they cannot access application forms or read medicine bottles. That is one in six adults. The House can be sure that a disproportionate number of them are in the rental sector. The Bill will result in more people losing their homes in view of the fact that they will have to navigate a cumbersome and technical system that has been criticised by many homeless agencies. Disturbingly, the Minister plans to criminalise tenants for false declarations without doing the same in respect of landlords availing of eviction exemptions. To do this to someone at risk of losing his or her home is despicable. The Minister also needs to clarify whether the Bill, as proposed, will stop rent increases until January 2021 for all tenants or just those impacted by Covid-19. This is the latest last-minute Bill over many years that attempts to address issues in the body of law covering residential tenancies. Sadly, it fails to address adequately the main excuses used for evicting tenants, which are a driving force of homelessness. If something has successfully prevented people from losing their homes and entering homelessness, why change it? We have tabled 12 amendments to various sections. We look forward to debating those points with the Minister as the Bill progresses.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Our grandparents' generation, particularly our grandmothers, used to say that education was no burden. Some 80 or 90 years ago, a child might well have come to the kitchen table at age 12, 13 or 14 to tell of an offer of a job in a factory or on the docks, which was a chance to leave school and go into employment.The mothers of those families - our grandmothers - would say that education is no burden. Not only is it not a burden, but is also the great liberator which saves families from poverty and young people from disadvantage. It gives them the life chance they need to maximise their potential. The tragedy of education is that so many people fall through its cracks. In Ireland, one third of primary school children in disadvantaged schools leave with basic reading problems, and 17.9% of our adult population is functionally illiterate. If one compares two three year olds, one from a disadvantaged family and one from an advantaged or regular family, the disadvantaged three year old has one third of the oral language capacity of the advantaged one. That is 400 words versus 1,200 words, before they come anywhere near a school gate. In America, where the prison system has been privatised, the prisons predict how much spare capacity and prison cells they will need in 15 years by looking at the literacy rates of ten year olds in their districts. Education is absolutely the great liberator. The most powerful thing in the world, which can change not just a village or a family but an entire country, is a girl with a book. That is why it is so infuriating, dispiriting and upsetting to see education and those who work and believe in it being so disrespected in the last number of months. SNAs had to endure a bungled redeployment programme. Teachers, principals and parents listened to Minister after Minister giving different advice and sound bites about the potential for reopening schools. We had the spectre of blended learning hanging over us for the entire summer. Then we had the leaving certificate and student representatives hearing about the delay in leaving certificate results in the media. The package the Minister has produced is welcome. All of us have a responsibility to speak positively about the potential for this package to open schools because if we do not open them next month or in September, we are going to lose an entire generation of vulnerable young people who are not legally required to be in school if they are over 16 years of age. Schools and teachers have been much maligned by people writing columns in newspapers who do not have a cat's clue what it is like to work in a school or with a vulnerable young person. Teachers are holding schools, and sometimes families, together by their fingernails and often ensure that young people do not make the wrong choice at the wrong time. They have been holding on to a whole generation of 16 and 17 year olds while they have been out of the school buildings and hoping, praying and encouraging them to come back in September. If we lose that generation, we will most likely lose them forever. That is a burden on them, and on all of us. This package has to work and we want it to, but we have grave problems with some of its elements, which we hope the Minister can address over the next few weeks. The lateness of the package is not the Minister's fault and I would not necessarily blame Fianna Fáil for it either because it has only been in office for a few weeks. However, myself, Deputies Ó Laoghaire and Gannon, representatives from other political parties and members of the Covid-19 committee have been calling for a package for months. We asked for it in April, May and June and we asked again this month. It has arrived and it is substantial. However, principals have said to me that it should have come with a magic wand because they need to magic up some teachers and school buildings that do not exist. It is our collective responsibility as politicians to show a little bit of leadership, to provide some certainty, and to suggest to the Irish people that this can work and that we can open schools. It is not just about opening schools, but ensuring they stay open as well. I spoke earlier about disrespect and how SNAs, teachers, parents and education have been disrespected. This package suggests that special educational needs teachers will be used as substitutes. That is not just disrespectful to the profession they lead and the work they do keeping vulnerable students in touch and connected with education, but it is also disrespectful to those young people who need the individual attention and special educational expertise those teachers provide. Suggesting that they can just be shifted over to a substitute position is unfair and disrespectful and it cannot work. As regards the transport situation, I understand that parents have to apply for school transport for their children by this Friday. Some 120,000 children and young people, 14,200 of whom have special educational needs, use this service. However, the school transport operators are in no position to make a firm commitment this week or by this Friday on whether they can do the job. The least we can do is delay the date by which parents have to apply for that transport scheme. That is another practical suggestion for the Minister.  I refer again to education being no burden and being a great liberator. Education is a life chance for young people to be everything they can possibly be and we, as a collective and an Oireachtas, cannot get this wrong. When the Government holds its Citizens' Assembly on education, which we support and want to be constructive within, we have to deal with the disrespect that has been shown to education down through the generations. We must also address the fact that it is not funded enough, that our class sizes are some of the highest in Europe, that our literacy rates are a national scandal and that we could do so much more if we realised the eternal power of education.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I intend to be brief, but I concur with my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, about the Tánaiste's engagement with his portfolio. It appears to those of us in opposition that it is beneath him to address matters pertaining to his Department in the Oireachtas. It is approximately two weeks since he took a swipe at the Labour Party's proposal to introduce legislation in reference to the High Court decision on sectoral employment orders. He dismissed it as virtue signalling. I have been waiting for an opportunity on the floor of the House to take him to task for that remark. We have had two sessions of Private Members' business on the broad theme of employment rights, one tabled by the Social Democrats and another in the form of a motion relating to the Debenhams workers from Solidarity-People Before Profit. We have also had the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill. Despite all of those debates, I am still waiting for an opportunity to engage with the Tánaiste. There are themes that other political parties in the Dáil and I want to return to under the broad umbrella of the economy, employment rights and company legislation, but if the Tánaiste is not present for at least part of those debates, he will not hear those messages or be influenced by them. That is not in any way a reflection on the entire team in his Department, and I respect the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, very much, but it undermines what we are trying to achieve when the Tánaiste does not seem to be minded to address issues raised in the House and pertaining to him. We have studied this Bill and proposed no amendments to it because we view it as timely and necessary. I note the level of consultation that the Department has had with various stakeholders in order to ensure that the legislation is robust, is necessary and can operate effectively. However, I will make a point about how the economy and business will change in light of remote working, online meetings, etc. There is a growing assumption that the manner in which businesses operated remotely or how meetings took place remotely over the course of the pandemic was 100% positive. Although it was positive to see a reduction in traffic and the amount of time workers spent commuting and it was positive that people could spend more time at home, what happened was not universally positive. In some circumstances-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The point I am making relates to remote working and the fact that there is an assumption that it is in all circumstances a positive. If, however, a company decides that a worker can in all circumstances work remotely and connect remotely to the workplace, that is something which will need to be regulated heavily by the Government and via legislation. There may be overcrowded housing, the workers may be young or may not necessarily have access to the appropriate materials or IT equipment. In addition, workers may not be able to connect remotely or may be uncomfortable doing so. We need strong regulation and oversight of this issue because, as the Minister of State knows, the market has no conscience. Therefore, how companies operate their interactions will need to be heavily regulated if the workplace is to be radically different in future. We appreciate the motivation behind the Bill, but, like Deputy O'Reilly, we hope that other areas of company law, oversight and employment legislation will be dealt with as speedily. We are still awaiting a Government response to the Duffy Cahill report on issues surrounding Clerys, Debenhams and HMV, matters that were referenced recently during Private Member's business. It is this sort of speed that makes the public realise what the Government's priority is. While we have no issue with the speed with which this Bill is being dealt, if every legislative measure governing employment law and workers' rights was dealt with as speedily, there would be a sense across all sectors of society that the Government was even-handed and would respond to the needs of employers and employees equally. Some of us would rather it if the Government spent more time listening to the concerns of employees than employers, but if the speed was seen to be even-handed across the spectrum, there would not be the sense of alienation from the political system and legislation that governs the way people work. There is a sense that if one is a captain of industry or a company director, one's access to the Cabinet, the decision makers and those who prioritise legislation is swifter, whereas if one is a shop steward or trade union representative, one's access is not as swift and one cannot get what is necessary done. The Duffy Cahill report was published in 2017, but here we are in 2020 and the issues it covered are still surfacing. To summarise, it is important that the Minister of State convey to the Tánaiste our disappointment regarding his failure to attend. A number of issues have arisen in recent weeks but the latter has not been present. If he does not hear the messages from this Chamber, he will not react positively to them. We welcome the Bill and have not tabled amendments to it, but we must be careful about how the sector is regulated in future so that we do not fall into an assumption that all elements of remote working are positive. We must be mindful of unreasonable burdens being placed on workers, in particular young ones, in terms of how they interact with the labour force. My third point relates to the swift way in which this legislation is being dealt with versus long delays in addressing issues concerning amoral actions of businesses in overriding workers' rights.We will not be tabling any amendments and will be supporting the Bill but I hope the Minister of State will take the comments of the Labour Party on board and relay them to the senior Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish citizens' assemblies, including one on drugs and on education, which I believe is restricted to primary and secondary education. I seek further detail on this commitment, including when will this be established, its terms of reference and the timescale for its sittings.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Some of the reservations people in education have about the Minister's appointment do not relate to any lack of ability, competence or understanding of the education system. Our nervousness is that when a conservative Department meets a conservative Minister, the possibility of a radical overhaul of our education system may be affected. Such an overhaul could lead to having equality at the centre of the system and addressing its constitutional underpinning, which ensures that we do not really have a State education system. We will not necessarily have the opportunity to deal with that in a radical way. I was hoping that the proposed citizens' assembly could deal with the constitutional underpinning of the education system. In her response, the Minister did not give a timeline as to when the citizens' assembly will meet. I ask again what is the Minister's ambition for its establishment, sitting and terms of reference? I am sure she has an opinion on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That all sounds great. My problem is in predicting our engagement with the Minister. Over the next period when we raise something that could radically overhaul the education system or bring in legislation that could enhance equality provisions within education, her go-to answer could very easily be that we will deal with the matter in the citizens' assembly. What I need from her is a commitment on when she wants the citizens' assembly to be established. Even if she could name a year, I would appreciate it. The last thing I or any Deputy wants to do is have a policy, motion or Bill before the House and for the Minister to pick up a script saying the citizens' assembly is the best place to deal with it. I ask the Minister to give me a year by which she hopes the citizens' assembly will have started its deliberation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 1:In page 4, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:“(2) (a) The Government may from time to time by order extend the emergency period, either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision, for such period as it considers appropriate if it is satisfied that, having regard to the threat to public health presented by Covid-19 and the need to mitigate the economic effects arising from that disease, the making of such order is in the public interest.(b) Every order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.”.Most of our amendments speak for themselves so I do not intend to have a prolonged debate. We have made our speeches and we know what is at stake. Our amendment clearly outlines our demand that the emergency period be extended. I am interested to hear the Minister's response to that. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be quick. Regarding the issues outlined by Deputy Ó Broin, we in the Labour Party will support this amendment. I also want to record my gratitude and that of my party to the Minister, Deputy Harris, for recognising the literacy issues in this State. Some 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate, and these are the people who we are asking to navigate the housing schemes we put through the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is why we support this amendment and that is why I was glad to see the Minister, Deputy Harris, recognise the situation regarding literacy this morning. We need to work collectively to ensure we have measures, legislation and documents that can be accessed by all the citizens who desperately need these services.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 4:In page 5, to delete lines 14 and 15. I wish to correct the Minister. Section 4(1)(b), as drafted, does not allow for a declaration by a tenant after the event. I want the Minister to correct his assertion. Unless something is in law and written down in black and white, the Minister's comments on the floor of the House only travel so far. Many of us are frustrated by attempts to criminalise in respect of any aspect of public policy unless it is absolutely necessary. I spend a significant amount of my time trying to ensure that those living with addiction are not criminalised because of the lives they lead and the difficult circumstances they are going through. In the Bill only one cohort of person on either side of the tenant and landlord relationship has the potential to be criminalised on the back of a what is termed a "false declaration", namely, a tenant.On that basis, we feel strongly that lines 14 and 15 on page 5 should be deleted and we will press this amendment. I am interested to hear not only what the Minister, but also my colleagues from Solidarity-People Before Profit, have to say.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party has an issue with the lopsided nature of the Bill. Somebody who owns property with a tenant in his or her property can play the game and get away with it by making declarations which many people know to be a half-truth, a non-truth or a blatant lie. That person will not end up with a criminal sanction under the provisions of this Bill, but the tenants who try to keep their family together, as other people have mentioned, face criminal sanction on top of potential eviction. That is why we feel so strongly about it and will press the amendment to a vote.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be as brief as possible in support of these amendments. The overarching thing we are trying to achieve was referenced by the previous speaker, with whom I agree. There can be a level of political game playing, either here or in Leinster House, as the Minister knows, in which the Opposition tries to depict the Government as uncaring, unfeeling and on the side of everything that is bad while everybody in the Opposition is on the side of everything that is good. It is not as simple as that, as we know. We know that everybody in politics comes into politics to make a positive difference. We are not trying to depict anybody in the Government as trying to do something destructive. The issue is that we have been having debates on housing and homelessness for the best part of at least seven years and the public has lost faith in politicians' ability to come together and deliver solutions. However, what the public has seen since March is that a Government intervention has made the difference. We are asking the Government to continue its own policy. If a measure introduced by the Government in March has resulted in a decrease in the number of people presenting as homeless and a demonstrable improvement in tackling the problem, why would the Government not just continue with the policy that is seen to be successful? That is what is so frustrating. The Labour Party and other political parties in the House are not trying to depict the Government as uncaring or unfeeling. However, if a Government policy is working, why can we not just continue to work with it? The problem is, as I said the other day, that we will return here in September and, while we do not want to be right, there is every indication that we will be right and that we will be in a position to say, "We told you". It is much more comfortable for me to stand in Dáil Éireann and say we were right than it is for the person who is affected by this Bill. Those are the stakes with which we are playing. We cannot get this wrong. I fundamentally believe the Minister is a compassionate person who wants to do the right thing in terms of housing people. I know that he has absolutely no intention of making anybody homeless. The problem is that the Government policy is working but this Bill is going to change that. The stakes are so high that I wish the Government would accept the amendments that have been put forward in good faith.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not agreed to.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party would like to support the proposal made by Deputy O'Reilly. I also wish to raise the issue of pandemic unemployment payments to those who are self-employed and those who are in receipt of employee wages and self-employed wages, who are now going to be put on a lower schedule of payment. We can only resolve this issue if the Dáil is sitting. We cannot have a six-week recess for those who are in receipt of this payment. It would be very simple for us to return here on Tuesday to have questions on this issue and come to a resolution on it and the issue outlined by Deputy O'Reilly.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister being here. It feels as if we are in the worst nightclub ever, spending this time together. Perhaps there should be some type of mechanism for us to interact over the month of August. I appreciate that we cannot recall the Dáil but we should find an imaginative way for Opposition Deputies and the Minister or her officials to engage in the weeks before the reopening because this issue is so important. I strongly hope that this plan works. We all need it to work and we need the Minister to be successful. I strongly believe we could work with the Minister in whatever way we can over the next number of weeks to ensure it is successful. I have a question about masks. Many schools are concerned about what type of protocols will be issued from the Department regarding the wearing of masks, particularly at second level and in respect of students who are vulnerable and have special educational needs. I have in mind children with cochlear implants who have concerns about how they might wear a mask. We need some guidelines on that. The issue of special education teachers being used as substitutes is crucial. I was a resource teacher for a period of time. It was difficult if my work was interrupted by going into a class to substitute for that class. Not only was my work disrupted but obviously the child who needed the attention was disadvantaged as well. That is something that needs to change. We have spoken about the lack of time. We cannot blame the Minister for that as she has only been in the office for less than a month, but obviously this package would have been required a number of months ago. However, we are where we are, as they say. On school transport, we probably need a few more days to allow parents to engage with the system. The Minister has delayed it to 4 August, but it probably needs to be delayed for a few more days. Can she speak on that? Regarding the issue of calculated grades, in fairness to the Minister, as part of the discussion this evening, she did arrange for a briefing with Opposition spokespeople on this yesterday and it was very informative. If calculated grades are going to be used as a mechanism for the leaving certificate in 2021 - I know the Minister will not want to make an announcement on this now or admit defeat on it at all - junior certificate and leaving certificate students of 2021 will need an early decision on that. If that decision is going to be made, it needs to be flagged well in advance because, as the Minister knows, students will have been out of the system for a number of months. Their potential for maximising whatever grades they could have got in the junior certificate or leaving certificate will be greatly impacted by that loss, so there will have to be some way the Department can look into that. If it means there will be some level of assessed grades, can an early decision on that be made? The Minister has plenty of time to respond to my last point. It has come to my notice that there are third level institutions that have internal documents circulating within them suggesting that only one day's attendance per week will be necessary for students when they come back in September. As the Department with responsibility for higher education is not legally constituted, I still must deal with the Minister for Education and Skills on this issue. If third level institutions are circulating such documents, is she aware of such conversations taking place within third level institutions? If this is the case, how can we stand over the maintenance of the student contribution at its current level if students will get only one day per week of in-class tuition? Further, why should we expect students to seek accommodation for themselves in the middle of a housing crisis if the in-class tuition they are expected to receive in September will be one day per week? To summarise my points, I seek greater clarification on masks and mask wearing; on special educational teachers being used as substitutes; and on school transport and how long parents have to apply for it. Obviously, a lot of school transport providers are still unsure as to what they can do. I want a straight answer because, unfortunately, I asked the Minister a straight question a number of weeks ago in this Chamber and did not get a straight answer, and then there was a press release a couple of hours later. I am asking her about this situation in third level institutions. Is she aware of third level colleges that within their internal conversations are suggesting there will be only one day per week in class or physical teaching, if I might put it that way? If that is the case, and if she is aware of this, does the Minister think it is appropriate that the student contribution should remain at the same level? Does she think it is appropriate that students would be under such pressure to try to obtain student accommodation for themselves, given that they will be in class only once a week?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I very much appreciate the Minister's presence here this evening. She has had a long day of engagement with Deputies and Senators on a wide range of issues over the course of this day. It is now past 2 a.m. and she is still here. I appreciate that. I made a comment about a Cabinet colleague of hers not affording us the same respect, but she is here and it is greatly appreciated. For those who are interested in the topic that we are going to discuss, it shows the seriousness with which she takes the issue. The campaign for Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school was started several years ago. I was involved in the campaign from the start. There is great interest in the establishment of an Educate Together school in the catchment area as laid down by the Department. The Department determined that there should be a new primary school for the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf and so the competition, for want of a better word, was started and Educate Together was deemed to be the most appropriate patron body to take on the running of that school. All was fine. However, with the school to be opened last September, a site within the catchment area was not found. A particular site was investigated for a period of time, but my understanding is that there was an issue with planning. After a long period of time, a site was found outside the catchment area, at Suttonians Rugby Club in Sutton, to enable the school to open. As a result of that, many parents who were enthusiastic about sending their children to this school thought otherwise because the idea of travelling from Clontarf, Raheny or Killester to Sutton and back again for an infant was just not going to work out. I am not sure if the Minister is familiar with the geography of the area. Suffice it to say that having a school even on a temporary basis outside the catchment area when it is just trying to find its feet, to embed a culture and to embed a dynamic around the school was not going to work. On the basis that it would be a year, many people felt that over the course of that year the Department would work hard to ensure that by following September there would be a physical site in the catchment area. Obviously, the pandemic has most likely interrupted that process and parents will probably face into a second year on site in the rugby club in Sutton. The agreement from the off was that it would be a two-year arrangement. What plans and processes are in place for the Department to ensure that a temporary or permanent site within the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf can be obtained for this school so that it can embed itself in the community which it has been established to serve? It has not been established to be located in Sutton. It has been established to serve the students of the Killester, Raheny and Clontarf catchment area. Of course, priority is given to children who reside in that catchment area. The issue is very simple. I ask for an indication of what moves the Department is making. It would be great to have it this September. If it is to be September 2021, what is the likelihood that we can have Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school in the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is very positive. I appreciate the Minister's response. I think the parents of children who are attending the school or intend to attend the school will be very satisfied with that response. A permanent site option for the new 16-classroom school has been identified. We are not talking about a temporary site but a permanent one and it is in the school planning area. It is quite a wide area and it spans what would border Fairview all the way down to the Kilbarrack Road, which is quite a large catchment area. I also appreciate that there are commercial sensitivities associated with the land acquisition. I appreciate that the Minister cannot go into any further detail. I appreciate the answer she has given me. This will be greatly welcomed by the school community. I ask the Minister to continue to engage with me and other representatives in the area to ensure this matter stays on the top of the agenda locally. It is crucial that if a child is from the given locality, he or she has an opportunity to attend Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school in his or her own locality. I appeal to the Minister to continue to engage with me, the board of management, local representatives and the school community as this process continues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister. Politics can be a difficult and harsh game but we in the Labour Party do not see it as our job to make the Minister feel uncomfortable over the next number of years. In fact, I want to be in a position to congratulate the Minister as often as I possibly can. There are certain issues in Irish public policy that go beyond the over and back, Punch and Judy style of politics and education should be one of those. We are in an historic situation where for the first time in the history of the State there is a question mark over the leaving certificate and over the reopening of schools in September. I do not believe that happened during the Second World War and am pretty sure that it was the mammoth task the Minister took it to be when she took over her role. On that basis, the Minister is deserving of congratulations and her Department is deserving of great credit for the fact that the schools are opened and that on the really dangerous part of the assessed grade system, the school profiling, they did listen. There are two different types of Opposition speeches and politicking. One is where members come into the Chamber hoping that what they are raising will not be adhered to by the Government because then they can keep complaining about it. Sometimes they put down an amendment to legislation, hoping that the Government will not adopt it so that they can keep giving out about it. There is a different type of Opposition where members raise something that they genuinely, earnestly hope that the Government will take on board because it comes from a place of deep concern and understanding. In fairness to the Minister, we raised the school profiling issue again and again and it was with great joy that we learned a number of days ago that the Minister had listened to the concerns raised and had acted upon them.That type of politics does this House some credit and I thank the Minister most sincerely for the moves she has made and for taking on the responsibility of opening up our schools. Obviously, there will be issues over the coming months and I know the Minister appreciates that. We are not going to agree on everything. Perhaps we will not even agree on most things. At the same time, if we are determined to work together in some capacity, we might actually achieve some things. Many schools were not in a position to tell the true story of the difficulties they had because every school runs on the basis of reputation. If those running schools start telling the world that the schools cannot open because of lack of space or whatever, it could potentially reflect poorly on them. Every September many schools are concerned about the numbers necessary to keep teachers and resources etc. There can be a conspiracy of silence sometimes whereby schools are so determined to keep their reputations going that they will soldier on and not put their heads above the parapet. School transport is an issue. It falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. We need a dedicated unit so that Members of the Oireachtas and school boards of management can access a dedicated unit swiftly to get answers to the transport questions arising. It has been said that we need not only to open schools but to keep schools open. The testing regime for teachers, special needs assistants and other school staff, including secretaries and caretakers, has been prioritised by teaching unions and the Minister is responding to this. At the briefing earlier today, I raised the issue, as the Minister is aware, of those who are over 16 years of age and, therefore, have no legal requirement to be in school. I was comforted and satisfied by the answer Department officials gave that the Minister is aware of the issue of the potential for a lost generation of young people, that the Minister is alive to that fact and that resources will be made available to schools to ensure that no young person is lost from the system. The final thing I will say on this matter is what Covid-19 has done, as in other areas of the economy and society, is it has ripped open the plaster covering deficiencies in the system, including the relationship between the Department and individual schools, the fact that the Department does not like to engage in the day-to-day management of schools and the amount of autonomy given to school boards of management and patron bodies that really should be part of the role of the Department. These are historical constitutional matters that I want to raise in the Citizens' Assembly on primary and secondary education. I know the Minister has committed to that in the programme for Government. We are determined to work with the Minister to find solutions. There has been enough distress, uncertainty, chaos and tears over the leaving certificate and the school system in recent months without politicians adding to it. We need to talk about the leaving certificate in 2021 and what last year's fifth year, or this year's sixth year, students are going to face. We must have some recognition in the system of the difficulties they had last year and we need to think of the kind of system we put in place for them. I hope the Minister takes the Labour Party's bona fides at face value. We genuinely want to find solutions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House and the establishment of his Department, which will give us an opportunity to focus on the issues of further and higher education. I very much welcome his opening remarks because he covered a number of issues, such as the stigmatisation of young people, which is unfortunate, and the issue of sexual violence in third level institutions, which he is passionate about tackling. We also want to discuss the funding of third level education and the Cassells report, which the Minister referred to. The previous Minister with responsibility for the area, during the previous Government, ruled out the student loan contribution scheme, which was a positive move. I turn to an area the Minister has highlighted since the beginning of his tenure, namely, the issue of literacy and numeracy among our adult population. I feel passionately about it because, like many areas of Irish public policy, not enough people talk about it. There is a significant element of stigma attached to it, just like most matters that are difficult to grapple with, and there is even an element of shame. A total of 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate. "Functional illiteracy" means being unable to read an instruction manual, an application form or the back of a medicine bottle. It does not mean the person is illiterate or that he or she cannot read or write his or her own name, but it does mean he or she cannot fully participate in our society. The figure of 17.9% is one sixth of the population. Many people either do not believe that figure or are astounded by it, but it is true and it has actually improved, given that a number of years ago, it was calculated at 23%. Can one imagine how one could live one's life, or negotiate one's day, without the level of literacy that one needs? One of the measures we proposed in the previous Oireachtas was a plain language Bill, which would have ensured that all public documents would be accessible. More often than not, those who need public documents the most to survive are those with lower literacy standards. It should not be so difficult to read a public document. It should not be like opening an encyclopaedia. It should be accessible and easy to read and understand. I sometimes wonder whether public documents are put together almost deliberately to confuse. If this is what is between a person and accessing his or her rights, payments or benefits, often it can be one step too many for people. The second positive policy proposal we had was to establish an agency that might be called "Literacy Ireland". As the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, has told us, there are about eight Departments that deal with literacy or with elements of literacy. With that kind of approach to literacy, whether from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Department of Health, there is not one overall strategy that can effect change. One in three children leaves disadvantaged schools with basic reading difficulties. In the United States, private prison operators calculate how many prison cells they will need in 15 years' time by looking at the literacy rates of ten year olds. In this country, as in most other developed countries, the difference between the oral language capacity of a three year old from a disadvantaged family and that of a three year old from an advantaged family is as much as 66%. On average, there are 400 words in the oral language capacity of the former, versus 1,200 words in that of the latter. Obviously, that will reflect itself in the adult's experience. I have only a number of minutes to raise these issues with the Minister, but it could be really powerful if Members in government and in opposition could together achieve something on the literacy scale. If we were to establish an agency such as "Literacy Ireland", or to place a governmental priority on an issue such as literacy, imagine how many people it would liberate. They would be able to say that while they have grappled with a literacy issue all their lives, a door has now opened to them and they can fully participate in their society, their economy, their families and their democracy.It is powerful. I appreciate that was one of the first statements the Minister made in his current role and one of the first groups that he met. If he is genuine about working with the Opposition and having positive policy proposals to tackle this issue, that is something powerful that the Oireachtas could achieve.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State and appreciate the opportunity to share some thoughts with her. My time is short so I will speak to two main matters. The first is the way SNAs are treated and the second is access to very basic provisions for children with additional needs in the community, including school places. A crisis often reveals what society is really like, the priorities of that society and what it genuinely respects. The SNA role has been in our education system for approximately 20 years and there are endless stories of disrespect being shown to SNAs within the school system and individual schools, sometimes by principals and often by the manner to which they are referred. For example, most are referred to by their first name rather than surname in secondary schools. They are asked to do menial tasks such as collecting lunches and they do not get to use the same staff facilities. This does not happen in every school, clearly, but such cases in a number of schools have been brought to our attention. It is difficult to stamp out this practice and get people to show more respect to our SNAs in daily school life when the Department demonstrated a stunning lack of respect for the role they play in our schools during the pandemic. This was not the fault of the current Minister of State, who was not in situ at the time. The manner in which the potential redeployment was handled just goes to show once again that when it comes to teachers and buildings, the Department knows everything. If it is not a teacher or a building, the Department of Education and Skills knows nothing or pretends to know nothing. It will act as if anything that is not a teacher or building is an irritant and that people should almost be thankful they have a job in the first place. I want to impress on the Minister how we are coming from a very low base when it comes to showing respect for our SNAs. They are included in every parliamentary or ministerial speech about the education system and we all love our SNAs. If this is the case, they must be paid properly and they must have proper terms and conditions of employment. Respect must be shown to them in the school system and this should also be shown by the Department. If the redeployment debacle is anything to go by, we have a long road to travel for SNAs to believe the Department and Minister have their back. I was embarrassed by the manner in which they were treated when we were all told we were in this together.On the issue of school places for children with additional needs, particularly autism, I was quite frankly horrified by the treatment of parents who are completely exhausted. The Department is almost depending on the exhaustion of parents dealing with a challenging diagnosis to prevent them exposing the scandal of what they are expected to go through. It is one thing to receive a challenging diagnosis and do one's best as a parent. It is quite another, when trying to find a school place, to be handed a sheet of paper with a list of schools on it by the special needs organiser and wished the best of luck. It is up to the parents to access a school place. Schools have given any number of excuses for not being able to facilitate children with additional needs, many of whom have autism.  I know the Department and the Minister have intervened in certain circumstances. The Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018 allows the Minister to do so. However, it is an absolute scandal that just when parents need as much support from the State as they can get, they are handed a sheet of paper. In my constituency of Dublin Bay North, they have been directed to schools with addresses in Drogheda or told to pursue home schooling. That is all very well, but which of us is competent to know how to choose a tutor to come into our homes so that a child with special educational needs will be taught well and given expert tuition? I wish the Minister of State well on these two issues and I am determined to work with her. I said the same to the Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris. However, I want to firmly mark the Minister of State's cards on these two issues. She must address the treatment of special needs assistants. Moreover, the Department is depending on the fact that the issue of school places falls between two Departments and on the exhaustion of parents preventing them from campaigning. That is a scandal and I hope the Minister of State will be able to address it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are in a pandemic situation; we have a virus that is making people unwell and is killing people. I wish that other aspects of Irish society and public policy were dealt with in the same manner which the Government has dealt with this issue and indeed other issues such as Brexit. There is nothing the Government would not do or say, no intervention it would not make and no resources it would fail to find in order to deal with the Brexit issue or indeed with this pandemic. There is another scourge in this country which kills people, ruins families, makes people incredibly ill, shortens their lifespans and ends their lives in public toilets, stairwells, parks and playgrounds. We have the third-highest overdose rate in Europe and yet we do not have the same political response to it because, in effect, the value placed on those lives is less. I know that to be the case because the very people who suffer from addiction and who are in recovery trying to rebuild their lives are called names. They are called names by politicians and by the media. They are called junkies, druggies and zombies. I once heard one commentator on RTÉ Radio 1 refer to a cohort of people in the court system as having a "Dublin 1 complexion". Last year we had a senior Minister sending out literature to her constituents celebrating the fact that a health facility in her constituency would not be a methadone clinic, because clearly those in recovery are beneath her, her office and her help. Furthermore, we criminalise them, we criminalise their addiction and their medical need. We think we can sort out the drugs issue in Ireland through criminal sanction. It does not work and it has not worked. It has not actually worked anywhere. The idea of a war on drugs is a colossal middle-class lie because a war on drugs is a war on people and a certain type of person. I say to the Minister of State that the issue of decriminalisation of the person has to be at the forefront of his agenda. Whenever someone in politics or in a lobby group or in public commentary uses the word "decriminalisation", people immediately assume something completely different. They assume we are talking about legalisation of substances or decriminalisation of cannabis. We are not. We are talking about decriminalisation of the person, because the opposite of addiction is not being sober. The opposite of addiction is connection, that is, connection with life and with people, connection itself.Yesterday and today, we have had debates on ensuring we can open public houses that sell a drug that kills 100 people a year through fatal overdose. Each year, 100 people die of a fatal overdose of alcohol, which is two a week. These Houses have been used to further the agenda of those who want to distribute that drug. That is fair enough. Nobody would ever suggest that the best way to deal with alcoholism, and the best way to stop 100 people dying a year, would be to stop selling it or to criminalise those who take it but that is exactly what we do with every other substance which is a drug. Will the Minister prioritise decriminalisation as a national policy? I also want him to prioritise the stated programme for Government commitment on the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs. It is a commitment in the programme for Government that can be delivered. It has to happen immediately because if we are in a situation whereby we have the third-highest overdose rate in Europe and people are dying on the streets throughout the country, then it is something that must take much higher priority. If it were to be treated in the same way as Brexit or Covid-19 we would have a much fairer and decent society that looks at the most vulnerable and does not call them names, dehumanise them or have Cabinet Ministers undermining them but has them looking at the Parliament to be filled with people of compassion who want to help support them in their recovery.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate Deputy Joan Collins and the Independent Group for tabling this motion. Quite a number of motions have been put before this House on workers' rights. Unfortunately, and I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is a common theme of the debates on these motions that a senior Minister is not in attendance. The Minister of State may consider that to be a political jibe and an unfair political criticism but it is the truth. The last time we discussed a motion of this nature a number of months ago the very same comments were made and it was reported upon. Whether it is the Minister with responsibility for social protection, Deputy Humphreys or the Tánaiste and Minister with responsibility for business, their absence gives the sense to those who are deeply affected by these issues, the workers, that they are absent from the thought processes of the Cabinet, as Deputy Barry rightly pointed out. My frustration is that we seem to be going from one industrial dispute to another, dealing with the individual issues that arise in each individual case and not looking at the entirety of the industrial relations architecture of the State which is clearly deficient. Myself and Deputy Ged Nash proposed legislation to deal with this situation but it was dismissed by the Tánaiste as "virtue signalling".That was a remarkable statement for the Tánaiste to make, when we try to be as constructive as possible and we try not to make personalised political jibes. It is a legislative body and we come here to propose legislation. As noted, Deputy Nash was the one who commissioned the Duffy Cahill report and he is somebody who knows this area intimately. He brought forward legislation, which is the appropriate thing to do, rather than trying to engage in any other type of political activity. However, our reasoned contribution was dismissed as virtue signalling by somebody who has done nothing.  It is also not good enough for the Tánaiste to say the Duffy Cahill report would not deal with the Debenhams situation. We might be willing to argue that over and back if the recommendations of Duffy Cahill had been actually implemented to the letter and then were found to be deficient. However, as has been stated, the Duffy Cahill report has been sitting somewhere in government since March 2016. To give my own party a level of credit, I do not think that would have happened if the Labour Party was still in government and I feel more weight would have been given to the importance of the issue. However, it is stuck on a shelf somewhere, not taken seriously by Government and certainly not taken seriously by the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, who has a history of watering down rhetoric around the rights of workers. He stood on a platform in order to become Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach, saying that essential workers should have restricted access to collective bargaining rights and the right to strike - it is in black and white in his literature. Again, as others have said, it is all very well to applaud these essential workers when they come to the country’s aid at a time of national crisis, but his instinct is that collective bargaining rights and strike rights are secondary to the great national endeavour about which he feels so strongly.  My point to the Minister is that this is about whether people feel the Government and the Legislature have their back or not. Is industrial relations in Ireland about conflict after conflict, or is it about having protections from within this body? I am glad I do not play golf and recent experiences have taught me I should never take up golf. Nonetheless, the industrial relations architecture of this State has been described as being like a golf club where somebody can become a member but they cannot play - they can join the golf club but they cannot play golf. In other words, the employer has a veto. Regardless of the efforts of many people in government and outside government who have put down legislation and tried to lobby in this area, we have probably some of the weakest industrial relations and collective bargaining legislation in Europe because the employer has a veto and there is no requirement on an employer to engage with a representative body which represents workers.  This is an economy in which, before Covid, 23% of workers were statistically on low pay, one of the highest rates of low-paid employment in the OECD, and some 40% of young people under 30 were in insecure work. These things happen only in economies which have weak industrial relations legislation and weak collective bargaining legislation.  What has happened before when a piece of legislation was brought to the Seanad or the Dáil is that the Attorney General has facilitated the Government by saying it is anti-constitutional. What we in the Labour Party would say is that it may be time to challenge that and to strengthen our Constitution by means of a constitutional amendment to enshrine workers’ rights in the Constitution. Therefore, no longer would we have the fallback position from Government that says, “We would love to help you and we really care deeply about this case or that case, but the Attorney General says it is unconstitutional, so what can we do?” If we can take on some of the thorniest, most difficult and divisive issues in Irish society, bring them to the people and have them resolved by means of a referendum, then why can we not do it for workers’ rights? If it means we have to require an employer to engage with the representative body of the workers, let us do it, because then we will not have an economy which is underpinned by low pay. I am quite sure it is an insult to people's sense of morality or decency, no matter what their background, where they live or what their income bracket is, that this economy has been propped up by low-paid work. This affects 23% of workers and, as was said earlier by Deputy Connolly, these are disproportionately women, migrant workers and young people.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, to tell the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to stop with the jibes, to engage with the responsibility he has, to implement the Duffy Cahill report and to maybe investigate the entire infrastructure through which we are operating. What is he so afraid of and what is the Government so afraid of? We need to even up the imbalance. If it takes a constitutional referendum, I am sure Deputies around this House and the people of Ireland would support such a referendum. It may take 18 months or two years, but I believe if we had that, we would not have this situation with the Debenhams workers, who have been courageously fighting for so long and inspiring so many people across the country with their battle, and we would not have poverty pay, insecure work and the level of unemployment that has been caused by Covid, which is directly connected with the way our economy has been constructed. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We had a debate earlier on workers' rights. I know the Tánaiste will have an interest in what was said and in the nature of the economy we are trying to grapple with, even since before Covid arrived, which is a low-pay economy. The Tánaiste spoke about this in his remarks also. We have spoken before about the disproportionate number of young people and migrant workers who are on low pay and the huge numbers of young people in insecure work. I will give context to the debate and what we are facing. This is not a debate on building an economy after Covid. We are very much in the thick of this. Professor Philip Nolan has stated that having seen the statistics tonight, he is more concerned than he has been at any stage of the pandemic since late April. Without trying to rehash a debate about yesterday, I put it to the Tánaiste that there is a level of confusion about what is happening in Dublin. Perhaps the Tánaiste will confirm to the House the situation with household restrictions. Only two households, regardless of their size, and a limit of six people can meet and socialise together. I understand that this also means bars and restaurants but I am not sure if this has been communicated, or if it is as well known throughout Dublin that restrictions are that no more than six people from two households can socialise. People cannot, therefore, socialise in a bar or in a restaurant beyond two households either. I am not sure if this has been clearly communicated. The Tánaiste might clarify this in his concluding remarks. This would have an economic impact on the city. It would have an impact on those who are booking tables and hoping to sell their wares in bars and restaurants. The point is well made for having a sector-by-sector response. I appreciate the efforts the Government has made. I am aware that it is difficult and that the Government has tried to keep as many people as possible on the standard of living they had been used to. The Tánaiste will appreciate that it can be frustrating for sectors that are not getting the same amount of media attention when they hear certain lobby groups in certain industries getting a huge amount of airtime. Other sectors may not be getting as much attention, which is frustrating. Some industries are clinging on but others may not survive as a total industry. I will refer to two, one of which is the travel agent industry. My office met with representatives of the travel agencies yesterday. The industry supports 3,500 workers. The industry has been though a lot, as one might imagine, such as ash clouds, wars and 9/11. The industry has survived but it cannot just close its doors and then hope to reopen after a period of time. The agencies must try to recoup refunds for people they deal with, and they provide a particular service because there is a callback or a guarantee that is a friendly Irish voice for those who depend on travel agents. The industry has told me that if specific sectoral supports are not put in place now, there will not be an Irish travel agent industry after Covid. It could be run from abroad or from the UK. We need to be mindful of this when formulating responses to Covid and when formulating budgets. How do we decide sector by sector and how do we formulate responses to protect jobs? The Tánaiste will know that it is much easier to protect or maintain a job than to create one. The travel agent representatives have some very practical suggestions as to how this might be done and I wanted to flag this with the Tánaiste. While the travel agents industry represents 3,500 jobs, another group that makes the case for 35,000 jobs is the live events industry. I have to say this is absolutely remarkable. I would not walk out in the middle of a Deputy's contribution in this Chamber. I have stayed to the end when other Deputies were making their contributions and then I have left. The previous contribution I made in this House was on the matter of workers' rights and we did not have a senior Minister for the debate. I did not make that point again when the Tánaiste was here. I thought I had made my point on that and that I would leave it. He sat there, listened to half of my contribution and then he left. I find that incredibly disrespectful to what we are trying to achieve here. Honestly, I walked into the House thinking that the time for party political point scoring was over. I thought let us have some practical solutions here and let us talk about the travel agents I talked to yesterday and about the live events industry that supports 35,000 jobs but in the middle of my contribution the Tánaiste decides to walk out. He could not wait, literally, for five minutes. Is there any point in me continuing my contribution?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My point is made but I want it to be recorded. The Minister of State, with respect, is here and he made a contribution which was well put together and was appreciated, but the Government cannot go on the airwaves and in the media and suggest that the Opposition is not being constructive, that the Opposition is part of the problem or that the Opposition is trying to sow confusion when in the middle of a contribution by the Opposition the Tánaiste decides to leave. He left halfway through it. We are all in this together. We are all doing our best. We are all trying to show leadership in our communities and to say to the people we represent that we can get through this, that we will get through this, that there will come a day when we can hug our grandparents again, meet our friends again, walk to the shop again, not have to wear a mask again, go to a football match again and that there will come a time when we do not have to be worried about this virus again. That day will come and we will celebrate that day. Hopefully, when that day does come we will have an economy and a country of which we can be proud. So many things have been ripped open and exposed by this virus, including the inequality, the housing problems, the issues of low pay that I mentioned already, with 23% of Irish workers on low pay - I am sick of saying it - and large numbers of young people in insecure work. All of these issues have been ripped open, including the issues in education with overcrowded classrooms but we can work together on these things. We can find solutions together on these issues. We can actually prove to the people of this country that when it comes down to it, Irish politicians are better than what is happening in the UK or the US right now. We are a collective that, when it comes down to it, has the Irish nation at its heart. We should be able to say, on examining the Irish nation, how it is formulated, the economy, society and all of the rest of it, that when we went through a pandemic, we came out the other side of it and we actually decided to repair what was wrong - the disadvantage, the housing, the inequality, the way that our systems and our Parliament are formulated. We can work on a huge amount of that together. I have spoken to the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, about his belief in doing something about adult literacy. I have spoken to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, about her belief in doing something on free schoolbooks. We have spoken across this Chamber about things we can achieve together and we actually have achieved an awful lot together on a cross-party basis. That is what the people of this country want. They want to see us working together.  It is perfectly legitimate for the Opposition if it sees something that is wrong or inherently contradictory in a presentation by the Government to point it out. Two minutes ago, before the Tánaiste walked out, I said that there seems to be some confusion about the number of people who can meet together in their own family home compared to in a pub or a restaurant. I raised a legitimate point and sought clarity because we are all are getting phone calls from our constituents who are asking what they can and cannot do in the context of the regulations. Can I leave the county or not? Is the Government serious about not leaving the county or is it only half serious? To go back to my earlier point, midway through my contribution, the Tánaiste decided to get up and leave in some kind of mock protest. I wonder if there is any point in me engaging with the Tánaiste on this level because he seems to find it tedious when people decide to raise such issues with him. I have already referred to the live events industry which employs 35,000 workers. It is at a very serious point. It absolutely accepts why the restrictions were introduced and the rationale behind the Government's decisions. It has suggested that the Government reinstates a support payment of €410, the previous level of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and €350, the previous level of the pandemic unemployment payment which is vital for the skilled workforce in the sector until it fully recovers. The sector is unique in that it is almost entirely closed under Government mandate, with no opportunity to trade. This is the real issue here. This is not about it trying to re-establish a relationship with its consumer base; it is mandated by the Government not to operate. A sector by sector, strategic investigation by the Government as to how we can recover certain elements of the economy would be beneficial to us all. Issues concerning workers' rights, low pay and representation rights for workers were dealt with in the previous debate this evening, so I will leave it there for now.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It might be appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is taking this because he is in charge of the national drugs strategy. The issue of drugs is an important issue throughout the country but on the north side of Dublin, it causes great heartache. In June 2019 on a visit to political leaders in Dublin Bay North, the assistant Garda commissioner confirmed that a Garda station was to be located in the Dublin 13 or Dublin 17 area to serve the vast expanding community in Clongriffin and Belmayne. It is expected an extra 50,000 people will be inhabiting the area in the coming years. We have had several successful campaigns in that area for the establishment of a second level school. We now have an Educate Together second level school and we are happy about that.I was involved with the local community, including the community in Clongriffin through the Clongriffin Community Association, in having a petition to ensure we would get a Garda station for the area based on community infrastructure. We were delighted when the assistant Garda commissioner announced that negotiations with the Office of Public Works, OPW, on a particular site at the corner of Northern Cross were ongoing and that a Garda station would be located on the site in the coming years. Aligned with that, a Government commitment was made during the general election that a Mulvey-style commission would be established on the north side and in Drogheda as a reaction to a murder spree in both those geographic locations. What I was trying to do, and what Deputy Ged Nash, who was then a Senator, was trying to say at the time was that the response to drugs and gangland murder should not be one of Garda resources only but also required an in-depth discussion about education, empowerment, oral language, youth development and housing along the lines of what happened with Kieran Mulvey's commission in the north inner city. We wanted that approach to be replicated on the north side and in Drogheda. After months of making repeated calls for such a commission in the Seanad - I was a Senator at the time - the then Minister for Justice and Equality agreed the Government would do so if returned to office. This commission is desperately needed. While I acknowledge these are difficult times and establishing a commission at this time would be problematic because of the national crisis we are in, poverty, disadvantage and drug crime still exist and people still have murder on their minds. I would like an update on that promised, pledged and proposed Garda station. At what stage is the process? When will the station be opened? When can the community of Dublin 13 and 17 be satisfied that the campaign, which they were thrilled to see reach a successful conclusion in June 2019, will result in the next stage of the process and the opening of the doors of a fully staffed and resourced Garda station in this expanding area on the north side of Dublin?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his response but the language in it does not give me much comfort. It states: "... I understand from An Garda Síochána that proposals for a new station will be considered as part of the next Garda accommodation programme". The assistant Garda commissioner announced in June 2019 that it would happen. I worry when I see words like "proposals" and "considered" in the Minister of State's reply. I appreciate his comments about the proposed commission for the north side and Drogheda. This issue is not about police alone. We cannot police our way out of a murder triangle, so to speak. A commitment to establish a commission was made by an outgoing Minister for Justice and Equality of a party that is still in government. As such, that should be considered and we are waiting for that to happen. The issue of whether it will happen is not up for discussion. A commitment was made in the heat of the general election campaign. That is what it took for a commitment to be made to establish a Mulvey-style commission for the north side of Dublin, and not just to discuss policing. It is all very well to talk about the policing element but there is so much more to talk about, for example, education, oral language, literacy, diet, access to employment, housing, transport, health and other issues. That is what the Mulvey commission in the north inner city was about. That commission was successful to a degree. It has successfully cut through the red tape and created immediate access for the community by allowing their concerns to go straight through to the decision-makers rather than, unfortunately, all the bureaucracy. I need a firmer commitment on the Garda station, which was a commitment made by the assistant Garda commissioner. I also need a date for the establishment of the Mulvey-style commission on the north side and in Drogheda, to which the Minister of State's party committed in the general election. It is still in government and, indeed, still holds the Ministry for justice.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I might cut my contribution to five minutes or thereabouts to facilitate other Members who wish to make contributions and who have been here all day. It is only fair we share the time. While everybody wants to support the Bill tabled by Sinn Féin, and the Labour Party also appreciates the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing, I am disappointed the Minister is no longer in the Chamber. We have, however, had some constructive engagement with him in the past, particularly on one of the housing strategies the Labour Party is trying to pursue, which is a rent-to-buy scheme. The Minister of State will appreciate that, particularly in high-rent areas, it is difficult for couples or individuals to rent and to save for a deposit at the same time. We were trying to reintroduce a previous scheme whereby an individual could, through the local authority, rent for three years, with all that rent going towards a deposit, and walk away from the scheme after three years if they so wished or put that towards a deposit and get on the property ladder, the idea being that one did not have to rent and save simultaneously. Many of these schemes were reasonably successful previous to the crash but were then discontinued. We want to work proactively with the Department and try to get some of these State-sponsored schemes up and running again to benefit people. I will say this much about the Minister's response. I served in government for a particularly short period of 18 months, and one of the big lessons I learned there was that when Government says something is not possible, unconstitutional or not legal, all those barriers can be overcome if the matter is important enough. There are any number of things we were once told were not possible, potentially not legal or potentially unconstitutional, concerns which were all swept aside once the Covid crisis hit. I refer to rent freezes, eviction freezes and the nationalisation of health services. I wish to outline how serious the situation is by referring to the Daft rental report for quarter 1 of 2020. It states that rents increased by 3.8% nationally year-on-year, which marks the lowest rate of inflation since late 2012. However, while rents fell nationwide by 2.1% between March and April of 2020 in the teeth of the Covid crisis, between their lowest point in the early 2010s and the peak of quarter 1 of 2020, they increased by between 52% in Connacht-Ulster and 107% in Dublin. As for rent-a-room trends in quarter 1 of 2020, in Dublin city centre, the average rent for a single bedroom was €715, an increase of 8.2% year-on-year. The average rent for a double bedroom in the city was €820, an increase of 4.6% year-on-year. In south-east Leinster, the average rent for a single bedroom was €389, an increase of 16.1% year-on-year. In Limerick city centre, the average rent for a single bedroom was €429, an increase of 16.3% year-on-year. In Waterford city centre, the average rent for a double bedroom was €399, an increase of 9.6% year-on-year. In Galway city centre the average rent for a double bedroom was €1,260, an increase of 19.7% year-on-year. According to the Daft housing report of July 2020, the average national rent was €1,412. The average rent in Dublin was €2,030 in July 2020. Monthly rents were on average 0.5% lower in Dublin but higher than March levels elsewhere. Rent has increased in Laois by 4% year-on-year and is now at an average of €1,002. Rent has increased in Longford by 3.3% year-on-year to €737 on average. Rent has increased in Kilkenny by 4.2% year-on-year to €999 on average. Rent has increased in Limerick county by 3.4% to €925 on average. In Longford, the monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment has increased by 8% year-on-year to €556 on average. In Carlow, the monthly rent for a one-bed apartment has increased by 9% year-on-year to €724 on average. I will give just one more example because I know that other Deputies wish to make contributions. In Dublin 24, the average monthly rent for a one-bed apartment increased by 5% year-on-year to €1,425. The point I am trying to make is that people in opposition are genuinely trying to find solutions and coming into this Chamber from a good place. I challenge the Minister's contention that when legislation is put in front of him, people are playing games, are not serious or are not dealing with crisis situations facing families and individuals day by day. When answers come that refer to constitutionality or legality, I do not necessarily take them at face value because of my experience. With a bit of imagination and the same sort of energy and belief we all came together with at the beginning of the Covid crisis, we could overcome a significant number of issues. With that in mind, I would like the Minister of State in his contribution to refer to the rent-to-buy scheme the Labour Party is trying to pursue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith. The Labour Party will support Deputy Ward's motion. I have sympathy with what the previous speaker said about not demonising young people and, indeed, particular areas. There is an area in my constituency which is having a particular issue at the moment. The Minister knows that because I wrote to her, the Garda Commissioner and the local Garda station about it. I do not want to name the park in question but I met residents of the area on Friday evening to discuss the issue. Concerns about fireworks and antisocial behaviour are so serious that local residents, who are proud of their area, feel they cannot go into the park after lunchtime. That is a particularly distressing message to get as a public representative. The park has been well resourced and people feel proud of it but it has now come to a stage that residents feel they cannot go into it after lunchtime. We are still in September and, as other speakers have said, this problem is only going to get worse. A Garda station has been promised for Dublin 13 and Dublin 17. It was announced by the assistant Garda commissioner in May 2019. I raised a Topical Issue matter about it only last week and was not encouraged by the response I got. Every time we speak about antisocial behaviour or policing, I am going to raise this issue. A crime task force was also promised for the north side of Dublin during the general election campaign on the basis that, as is the case in the north inner city, we cannot police one's way out of crime. We must speak to young people and talk about youth development, oral language, literacy, employment and health. A wide range of issues must be considered when we speak about crime, disadvantage and antisocial behaviour. The Government cannot police its way out of the problem. I have made this case every time there has been a shooting, gun crime or murder. I have said that we need a Mulvey-style commission or task force on the north side of Dublin and another in Drogheda. That was agreed when the general election was called. I want delivery of those task forces and I do not accept that we must wait for the Covid-19 emergency to pass before we can start to move on it. We can see that antisocial behaviour, disconnection and disengagement are still issues. The incidence of firework crime and antisocial behaviour has increased in September and is likely to increase further in October. I mean what I will say next with the greatest of respect to all speakers and am not in any way questioning the bona fides of anyone who has spoken on this motion from Government or Opposition parties. It is really not good enough to come into this Chamber and speak of resources that Dublin City Council needs for its work in community development and estate management and to adequately secure parks when members of parties in government and opposition last night joined together to cut €12 million of Dublin City Council funding which could have been used to tackle the very issues we are talking about.Politics can be difficult and means making hard choices. With the greatest of respect to those who have spoken about resources, development and investing in communities, I ask them to speak to their councillors because yesterday at a Dublin City Council meeting, a number of parties in government and opposition voted to rob my city of €12 million that could have gone a long way towards addressing the issues that we are talking about today.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«To recap the points I have made, I have written to the Minister regarding the particular park I have a concern about. The crime commission on the northside is important. The Garda station is important. The funding of local communities is important. Members cannot come to the House and speak about a lack of funding when they are voting, through their parties, to cut it at a local level.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I will be sharing time with Deputy Nash. I am very proud to propose this Bill to the House as a member of the Labour Party. This party and the labour movement were founded to protect workers and what is more important in a pandemic and health crisis? What greater action can the State take to protect workers during this pandemic only to ensure there is statutory sick pay for all? Sick pay is required in a health crisis. It may surprise many people in this country that we are one of only five European Union countries without statutory sick pay. We live in a low-tax and low-pay economy. As has been outlined by my colleague, Deputy Nash, on a number of occasions, 23% of Irish workers are in a bracket of statistical low pay, according to the OECD. Approximately 40% of workers under the age of 30 are in insecure work and who is most at risk of illness and needs sick pay more than those who are in low pay or insecure work? These people include workers in meat factories, childcare workers, contract cleaners and front-line staff in retail and hospitality, as well as agency staff in our health service. All these workers are holding our country together on the front line and all of them, at different stages, have gotten rounds of applause and plaudits from this House. Not all of them get sick pay. We can think of the worry and anxiety experienced by a person waking up with symptoms of illness and who is genuinely concerned about infecting others and about his or her own health but who must balance this with the fact that he or she might not get paid if he or she does not go to work. That is if the person is honest about his or her health. The person might struggle into work, thus contributing to the problem. Such a person's biggest problem, however, is low pay, poverty and insecure work. What are we doing to protect such people? All the schools are back, with 1 million children returning this September, which is good. What if a child is sent home from school because of an outbreak, however, or even a suspected outbreak or because the school has made the decision that a child must go home? A parent, grandparent or guardian of the child could have to care for the child without any statutory provision for sick pay. This Bill is a reasonable suggestion, if not a necessary emergency measure notwithstanding the fact we should have had this provision before now, in the teeth of a health crisis that is deepening and worsening. In my part of the country and that of Deputy Nash, the statistics are terrifying. As the numbers of people infected with Covid-19 increase, the supports for individuals are lessening, as we have heard on national radio. The Government's response to our move today, meanwhile, was not to reject this Bill out of hand. We welcome that. However, the Government is suggesting we should spend six months thinking or talking about the legislation. In the midst of a pandemic, we do not have six months to talk or think about something as fundamental as sick pay. We do not have six months. We could have a vaccine by the time the Government gets around to enacting legislation that would provide statutory sick pay for all workers. The Government is at risk of losing public support for its measures. We are on the brink of losing that support if rationale is not provided and supports are not maintained and if the Government is not seen to be on the side of the people.It is very difficult for us in public life to see the Low Pay Commission, LPC, advocating a ten cent increase in the minimum wage and to see the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which is relentless in supporting and advocating for those who are the lowest paid in our economy, having to walk away because that was the best the LPC could come up with. The Government does not have to accept the commission's recommendation in this regard. Let us turn our attention to those who are having that conversation in their own heads, that wrangle in their own minds, that horrible discussion with themselves. Do they go to work knowing that they are not well or do they do the right thing, in line with the restrictions relating to the pandemic, knowing that they are going to be out of pocket and that it will be harder for them to pay their rent and their bills and feed their children? There are also situations where parents, grandparents or guardians who have to look after sick children will be out of pocket. My very clear message to the Government is that, in a pandemic and a health crisis, the most basic provision that politics, Parliament and Government can provide is statutory sick pay. This pandemic has ripped open all of the problems in Irish society. It has identified major problems with our society, but a crisis is an opportunity to fix issues. If Ireland is an outlier and has a low-pay economy, we should do something about that. If we do not have statutory sick pay, unlike 22 other EU countries, we should also do something about that. I believe the Cabinet agrees that we should do something about it. The argument is not whether we should do something about it but whether we should do it today, this week, next week - when the vote is taken - or in six months' time. We do not have six months in the middle of a pandemic. We are hopeful of Opposition support for the Bill. We are also hopeful of Government support for it. We hope that the Government will move from a position of talking, assessing and negotiating to one of this Parliament collectively saying to the people of Ireland that in a pandemic sick pay is a basic provision that any decent democracy and Government should provide.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«All the issues to be discussed by the citizens' assembly are important but none more so than that of drugs. The Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy has stated in the House that he has twice written to the Taoiseach to try to find out when the citizens' assembly might take place. There is a feeling that in the middle of a pandemic, all that momentum for radical drug reform that had been building for years, on issues such as drug use, addiction and recovery, has, unfortunately, been lost. When the opportunity arose within the programme for Government to announce the potential for a citizens' assembly, it was seized on by those in this area as a great opportunity. We hope the Taoiseach will give more of a commitment as to when and how that citizens' assembly might meet.The Taoiseach knows the issues around decriminalisation are very important, such as trying to take people out of the criminal justice system and treating drug use as a purely medical issue. I suggest that the Taoiseach has an opportunity, given that he has a Seanad space free. While political parties will do whatever they can to make sure a particular candidate meets the criteria, and while I know it is the agricultural panel, would it not be quite powerful for the Taoiseach to do what he can to ensure that somebody who advocates for drug users and those in recovery could fill that space in the Seanad? It could be somebody like Tony Geoghegan, Philly McMahon or Peter McVerry. I know the criteria of the agricultural panel have to be fit, but at the same time, such an appointment would indicate to those who care deeply about this issue that the Government cares deeply about it and that it wants somebody in these Houses who has an intimate understanding of the complexities of it. Also, we need to know when the citizens' assembly will sit, because while I can speak about the health elements of this problem, for far too many families there is clearly a violent gang element to it as well, which is literally killing people on the streets in my constituency and throughout the country. We need a firmer commitment from the Taoiseach along the lines on which I have spoken. We need dates and we need to know the Government is on the side of these families and communities.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Taoiseach indicated, we cannot say we will deal with the drugs citizens' assembly question when the Citizens' Assembly meets. There was great co-operation across these Houses on the issue of injecting centres and decriminalisation. I will return to the Seanad matter for a moment. The Taoiseach nominated Colette Kelleher to the Seanad in a previous Oireachtas and the Government took on the suggestion of appointing a Traveller representative. It would be a strong sign if the Government could nominate somebody from the drugs field and who knows it intimately if it feels the drugs citizens' assembly would be delayed. It would make good a Government mess around Senator D'Arcy if somebody of that stature in the drugs area could be nominated.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sure the Taoiseach has a view on it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to join other speakers and note that the Labour Party supports moves towards a united Ireland. We are interested to know whether the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach has discussed the Government's vision with unionist leaders.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the announcement that was made earlier today. I note the Taoiseach stated that two places on the commission are yet to be filled. My party and I hope that full-time journalists will be appointed to those positions. In concurring with the remarks of Deputy Bruton, I would note that journalism is in a very difficult position, not least in these Houses where it has never been more important to have good journalism. Anybody who is reading the book "Champagne Football" or listening to the online podcasts about George Gibney will know that we need journalism to hold people to account, to find truth and to keep the institutions of the State, and every other institution, honest. However, even in these Houses it can be seen that many former political commentators have drifted into becoming political advisers because there is a feeling that journalism is not a sustainable profession at this time. It does not pay well, the hours are unreasonable and there does not seem to be as much of a future in it as may previously have been the case. That said, a central tenet of any democracy is the ability of journalists to ask questions and find the truth. Does the Taoiseach share that nervousness about the state of journalism in Ireland and internationally? Does he hope the commission can speak to those issues and deal with them in a real way?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am astounded by the Taoiseach's answer to my colleague and party leader, Deputy Kelly, that there has been yet another foul-up from the Department of Education and Skills in respect of the leaving certificate. The leaving certificate was postponed, the calculated grades system replaced it, the results date was postponed, and now it has been reported that for 10% of all students, there is an error in their calculated grades. Does the Taoiseach not think this deserves more of a reaction from the Government? Does he think it is acceptable that a party spokesperson on education, such as I, was not given any briefing or an indication of any briefing today from the Department about the upcoming statement from the Minister for Education and Skills? Does the Taoiseach not feel that it would be appropriate for the Minister to come to the House immediately to speak about this issue, which is yet another upsetting turn of events for those in the leaving certificate class of 2020?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not technical.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend Part X (Admission to Schools) of the Education Act 1998 insofar as it relates to taking into account a student's connection to a school by virtue of a family member having previously attended the school when deciding on an application for admission to that school, and to provide for connected matters.It feels strange to speak on an education Bill, considering what we just heard from An Taoiseach, but we will return to that in due course. The Bill will remove a clause in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, which was introduced by the previous Government, that has an element of elitism in it. Many elements of that Act are progressive and were supported by the Labour Party, not least the parts relating to the baptism barrier or to the powers granted to the Minister for Education and Skills to open special educational units within schools to facilitate children with special educational needs. Within the Act, however, as a deliberate result, I understand, of lobbying by a particular sector within education, there is provision for any school to allow 25% of its intake to be reserved for the children or grandchildren of past pupils. One can only imagine the type of school that would lobby for that type of provision to be placed into legislation. It was passed with the support of Fianna Fáil in the previous Oireachtas. I tabled an amendment to the Bill at the time but it was voted down. The Bill before us will remove that elitist element of that Act. What if somebody's father or grandfather did not go to second level, or his or her mother or grandmother, or what if somebody is not from the area and, therefore, did not attend a second level school nearby? What happens if a person is not from this country? This is a deliberate attempt to keep the royal bloodline of succession through particular elitist second level schools and it was done at the behest of those elitist second level schools.Government was lobbied and it bent the knee. The Government has allowed in legislation for 25% of a student intake to be reserved, not just for the children of past pupils, but for the grandchildren of past pupils as well. It is wrong and odious and it flies in the face of any sort of progressive protestations Government would have in the education space and it allows for schools to pick and choose who they would rather have in the door, depending on whether the children or grandchildren of past pupils are the ones who present themselves. This Labour Party Bill seeks to eliminate that provision within the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 and to ensure that when students or families present themselves to a second level school or to any school in this country, they can do so on the same basis. It should not matter, therefore, who one's father, grandfather, mother or grandmother was because in a republic we are supposed to cherish all of the children of the nation equally and we fundamentally understand that education is the great liberator. We cannot have a situation of liberating children and having republican legislation when a quarter of an intake of any particular school can be reserved, if the school so wishes, for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. We will be seeking support from across this House for our Bill. We got support from progressive voices for our Bill when it was presented in the last Oireachtas and we expect to get similar support this time. We hope we can work collaboratively and progressively with the Government and that it will acknowledge that this was an error within the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, that it has been proven to be elitist and that it should be amended and removed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Everybody in the House would accept that the Minister has had a lot on her plate. She tried to reopen schools and deal with a lot of inherited messes on her desk. Nobody is suggesting for a second that all of this is her fault. There are things she has to address in the coming time. She has to address too-large class sizes in primary and secondary schools. A teaching union is balloting for industrial action because of the nature of what is going on in second level schools. She has to sort out pay inequality. She has to provide proper pay and conditions for school secretaries. Her Department has to begin to deal with special needs assistants in a more respectful manner and vindicate the rights of children with special educational needs to get a school place. There is a huge amount on her agenda. In terms of the leaving certificate, from the beginning people in opposition had strong views on this and were not listened to. The then spokesperson on education, and current Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, said in a tweet that the written exam should be cancelled. We in the Labour Party said from the beginning that we did not agree with that assessment because we were completely unconvinced that a proper, fair and robust manner could be found to replace the leaving certificate in such a short amount of time. From the off we said that school profiling was a bad idea. It should have been deleted by the Minister's officials immediately but it was not. To her credit, she recognised it was wrong after the debacle in the United Kingdom and deleted it at the last second. That timeline is part of the problem. I had to force out of the Minister in the Dáil an admission that the leaving certificate result date was being delayed until 7 September because of the calculated grades system. I have come to the conclusion that if school profiling had been deleted earlier in the process, the process would have been more robust. The Minister engaged the services of this crowd, Polymetrika, without a procurement process or tender document. This process was overseen by a national standardisation group and an independent steering committee. A Dr. Janet Brown was appointed as the external reviewer. The Minister relied on the work of Polymetrika International. Apparently, one individual, who is the head of the Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment, CCEA, was on the steering committee. At the same time he was apologising for the Northern Ireland debacle, he was signing off on the system in the Republic.  The Department of Education and Skills placed the dreams, ambitions, emotions and mental health of 61,000 young people in the hands of their teachers and then Polymetrika. Guess who we could trust? We could trust the teachers. The body that the Minister employed to do this work obviously made a mistake. Was the system not road-tested immediately? Did the Department not say that this is the first time in the history of the State that we are not having a written examination, and therefore we have to road-test this system?  Some of the commentary from other Government spokespersons was to the effect that mistakes and these things happen. It is a bit like a builder telling someone a mistake with the foundations was made, but 95% of the house is fine. There seems to be an attitude that these things happen, mistakes happen and we can all just move on. One of the biggest educational decisions ever made was the decision not to go ahead with a written leaving certificate. One would imagine that the momentous nature of that decision would have reverberated throughout the Department of Education and Skills so that there was no possibility that an error could have come into play. Yet, two of them surfaced. After all of this, 6,500 students will have their grades changed and improved.  I have a number of questions. The Minister said, in what was a remarkable statement from a Minister for Education and Skills but is a statement of fact, that there are students who will not be able to attend the course they have legitimately obtained through this system because of an error from the Department of Education and Skills. That is a devastating thing for somebody to hear.  Deputies told the Minister about this timeline. We told her that it was wrong for students to get their school-based assessments and see the differential between that and their final grade after the CAO offers came out. We told the Minister that was a mistake because at that stage it was too late to appeal.  What is the Department planning to do for the cohort of students who may have already set up shop or made a decision to spend three or four years living in Galway, Cork, Limerick or Dublin and now discover, because of the Department's foul up, that their lives will now be completely different? Is the Minister going to say that these things happen, it will only affect them for a year, mistakes happen and that is the way goes?  The Government was told from the off that a system of calculated grades was not a small decision. It is not something that somebody tweeted about and then decided that somebody else could sort out the ramifications. It was a monumental decision. When one includes the fact that school profiling was included and then taken out, the decision was taken so late that the system could not then correct itself in time for the results to come out.  The CAO results came out and students did not know that there were discrepancies between the school based assessment and what the Polymetrika bunch had churned out.Now we understand that her Department does not trust anybody. It does not trust her Cabinet colleagues or anybody in the education sphere because nobody knew this was coming. Nobody from the third level institutions, the students union bodies or the teacher unions knew this was coming. Obviously, the Department of Education and Skills does not trust anybody. It certainly could not tell us but it could not tell anybody about what was coming. Let us forget about the political system for a second and focus on the young people and those who are going to be hurt most by this. In the minute or so the Minister has left to respond to me, can she address one central issue? The Minister is a compassionate and capable politician who is going to deliver much good change in the education system over the coming period of time. Many of the things she has done in her short period of time in office have benefited children and young people across the land in getting back into school buildings. I want to work with the Minister to achieve more. What is the Minister going to say to somebody who discovers over the coming days that he or she is stuck in Galway when he or she wanted to be in Limerick or some other place? What practical support is the Minister going to give that person because telling him or her that there was a mistake and the Government is sorry is not going to cut it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach will know that before the pandemic hit, 72% of artists in Ireland were earning less than the national minimum wage. Yesterday the Government agreed that the national minimum wage should increase by a mere 10 cent. On Monday in a very high-profile decision, the Government decided not to accept NPHET recommendations. The Tánaiste said that they had not been thought through. However, yesterday it took the Low Pay Commission's recommendation of a 10 cent an hour increase even though union representatives had walked away from the table. The Labour Party backs an increase of 20 cent. The difference for a full-time worker between 10 cent and 20 cent is €2.16 in take-home pay per week or just €4.37 in additional labour costs for the employer. What is the point in having a national minimum wage when almost three quarters of artists fall below the line that is set by Government? The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is also a critical support for the arts industry. Those in that industry will not get a chance to return to full work soon. There will not be a chance in any realistic way for this auditorium, for example, to be used for real entertainment any time soon. There have been some hints of a sectoral approach in the budget. Does the Taoiseach accept the need for a sectoral approach in the budget? We have previously raised this question with him in respect of the hospitality industry. I would like him to reply on the national minimum wage, the PUP and a sectoral approach to the arts.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With regard to special advisers and the special relationship between the three political leaders at the heart of government, all three individuals knew about the upcoming issue in the leaving certificate a week before it was announced by the Minister for Education and Skills. This information was not shared with the Cabinet. I am quite sure the special advisers attached to the Taoiseach's office knew. While the three party leaders knew, the entirety of the Cabinet did not know. Does the Taoiseach not think the Labour Party's recommendation of having an independent investigation into the entirety of the leaving certificate, including the involvement of the Taoiseach and his advisers, would ensure that we do not have a repeat of the debacle for the leaving certificate class of 2021?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach shared his assessment of Brexit developments with EU leaders last week. Next week's budget is being prepared on a no-deal basis. Will the Taoiseach share with us the key outcome of that meeting and his discussions with Ursula von der Leyen? Was there any agreement on taking action against Belarus? It appears to us in the Labour Party that the European Union has been very slow to speak strongly and with one voice about the rise of unrest across Europe and the rise of right-wing, almost neo-fascist, sentiment throughout the European Continent and within the European Union. The Taoiseach will be aware of a high-profile campaign, the 400 Welcomes campaign, which calls for the relocation of 400 refugees after a fire which took place at the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece which affected over 13,000 refugees. Ireland has agreed to take 50. The Taoiseach will agree we could do an awful lot more, given our history. We are the people of Famine ships and immigration which has seen us settle all over the world. We know famine and we know sectarian violence and have fled from it. As part of our historical national moral obligation, we should look at the situation in this camp in Greece and accept the fact that taking 50, while welcome, is not anywhere near enough. Will the Taoiseach, along with the various Ministers with responsibility for this, consider increasing that number to 400? It is expected of us internationally to live up to our own history and moral responsibility. I think the Taoiseach will agree we should do more.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Tánaiste and thank him for his speech. The Labour Party has always been pro-business and pro-Europe on the basis of what business and Europe can do for ordinary people, including workers. I am sure the Tánaiste shares my party's concern over potential export losses to the tune of €18 billion in respect of the UK land bridge. Eighteen billion euro is 40% of our entire export revenue. About 150,000 trucks are involved. The Tánaiste and many others who watch these matters carefully will know that the publication of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill caused absolute shock and dismay right across Europe. The Tánaiste said that, today or tomorrow, he will be communicating directly with 250,000 businesses across the country. That is a good initiative but a large number of businesses are so caught up in firefighting in respect of Covid that Brexit is far down the priority list. I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste is perhaps reminding them of what is potentially coming down the tracks. We do not know what is going on and what political machinations are taking place in Downing Street, nor do we know the mentality of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His actions heretofore have made me and my party believe we are not dealing with a stable Government or ordinary politics and that we are potentially dealing with somebody who is pursuing a no-deal Brexit strategy for his own ends. That means our relationship with the United Kingdom has been at its lowest ebb for quite some time. Although my constituency is urban, it has Howth Harbour and constituents who depend on fisheries. Obviously, the agri-food sector is important in many regions. I believe 20% of jobs in counties such as Cavan, Monaghan, Wicklow and Wexford are dependent on the agri-food sector, yet firefighting because of Covid has taken up most people's time. I suggest to the Tánaiste that there are other factors that cannot be put to the bottom of the agenda. I mentioned to the Taoiseach today that we must build a society and economy that are robust enough to withstand the shock of Brexit but we must also ensure we do not put things on the long finger on the basis that it is convenient to do so. The Tánaiste got major publicity for himself on Monday evening by telling NPHET it had not thought things through and by not taking its advice to move from level 2 to level 5, or level 3 to level 5, yet when the Low Pay Commission advocated a 10 cent rise to the minimum wage that was not accepted by those who think these things through, he accepted it. The trade union movement walked away from the deal on the basis that it would not be fair to workers. The Tánaiste might say to me that an increase represents an unfair burden on businesses but we have operated heretofore in a low-pay, low-wage economy. As I say constantly, 23% of workers are on low pay and 40% of workers under 30 are in insecure work. That is the economic model that this country was showing to the world. It has not been and is not sustainable. When the pandemic hit, the impact was felt mainly by the poorly paid. When dealing with Brexit and building a business model, we must ensure we can protect businesses but we must do so in a way that protects the people who work for them. Sick pay, employment security and pay are important in this regard. Having said all that, I believe it is easy for people who share the Minister's political ideology to state members of my political party are not serious about business and its cost. However, I have spoken to people in Dublin Chamber and other chambers around the country who are aghast that various political parties, including some purporting to be of the centre-right, have consistently cut the local property tax, thereby making councils depend disproportionately on commercial rates. I realise the situation is different now because of the Government's actions but the model the Tánaiste's local representatives are pursuing means councils cannot fund themselves or promote business and enterprise strategies to the best of their ability. Dublin City Council is €12 million down. Some of the resources could be allocated for community infrastructure, community building, addressing issues within communities and anti-poverty strategies but they could also be allocated for enterprise and development strategies at local level. Despite this, it was councillors in the Tánaiste's party, and Fianna Fáil in opposition, who consistently curtailed the potential of councils at local level to address these issues. It genuinely makes no sense to my party. If one is trying to provide supports for businesses and enhance the capacity of SMEs to survive the pandemic, one must realise businesses look not only for State supports but also for local authority supports. A local authority has to be fully funded and have the capacity to deliver such supports. One cannot say, on one hand, that the Opposition is not serious about its fiscal response, its demands regarding business and its talk of sick pay and tackling low-paid work while, on the other hand, not fund the local authorities, which are in many instances where SMEs and those in the local enterprise community go to look for support.If it was not for the pandemic, our minds and energies would be completely focused on the issue of Brexit. I am satisfied that we have the support of partners around the European table. It is of comfort to me that many of us in the Oireachtas have supported the European project over many generations on the basis that when it came to an issue such as this, we could seek solidarity from other member states and ensure that we have their backing.  I would like to summarise some of the points I have made. The enormity of what we are facing has to filter down to people - €18 billion worth of exports, 40% of our entire export capacity and 150,000 trucks that use the UK land bridge. That is colossal. If we are facing a no-deal scenario, that is potentially ruinous. There is also an issue, as I mentioned, in regard to the agrifood sector and the number of jobs dependent on it. I have not touched on the security or identity elements, on which I know the Tánaiste shares my concerns.  His communication with businesses around the country and his contribution earlier are to be welcomed. It is clear to the Labour Party, in particular to me as a local Deputy, that businesses are not equipped mentally or in any way for Brexit. I do not attach any blame to them in that regard because I am aware of their daily struggles in regard to whether the levels are going up and down and their capacity to trade. I reinforce the point that we cannot return to the model we had previously. Notwithstanding the pandemic and Brexit, a low pay, low tax model is not a model we can return to. The Tánaiste's personal insistence on budgetary matters to keep income tax regardless of what one earns, or USC, regardless of what one earns, on people at the higher end to cushion them from any sort of impact from budgetary changes is indefensible. Fine Gael party representatives on local authorities stripping away of moneys that could be used to invest in communities and to support business is also indefensible. That said, the Labour Party will stand by the Tánaiste and Government when it comes to having a united Oireachtas viewpoint and stance facing down a no-deal Brexit, which, unfortunately, it appears is the determination of the British Prime Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is refreshing that a number of Private Members' Bills and motions dealing with the issues we are discussing this evening have been put forward by Opposition parties and groups, including the Social Democrats, Sinn Féin, Solidarity-People Before Profit and the Labour Party. I have made a number of speeches on these issues in the House in recent months. That is to be welcomed. As previous speakers noted, there is a direct correlation between the fact that our economy is underpinned by poverty pay - with 23% of Irish workers on low pay, according to the OECD, and 40% of young people in insecure work - and the fact that collective bargaining regulations in this country give employers a veto. The current provisions have been described by the trade union movement as offering the possibility of joining a golf club without being allowed to play golf. I wish the Government would understand that there is a direct link between poverty pay, poor pay, exploitation and vulnerable work and the lack of trade union rights and collective bargaining rights. The two absolutely are linked and that is why we will continue to bring forward motions regarding sick pay, insecure work, poverty pay, low pay and collective bargaining. The Minister of State's party leader became leader of Fine Gael on the strength of his view that the rights of essential workers to engage in industrial action should be restricted. Some time later, he is leading the cheering for those same workers when it has been proven how important they are. It is not necessary to have these adversarial, over-and-back debates in this House between Government and Opposition. We do not have to drive a wedge between us and play the pantomime villain and pantomime hero on the issue of workers' rights. What is at stake is extremely important. People in this country are going to work even if they are sick because they are worried they will otherwise lose their jobs. We do not have statutory provisions in this country that other European countries take for granted. In fact, Ireland is one of only five European countries that does not offer statutory sick pay. Even though it may be imperfect, we support the Bill that is before the House this evening. I know Ministers are handed scripts by civil servants or from the Attorney General's office that poke holes in things. The Government needs to understand that trade unionism is good for living standards and for business. It is good for the economy that workers are protected and empowered in their workplace. We cannot go back to an economic model under which too many workers are poorly paid and vulnerable. Deputy Gannon spoke very eloquently in his tribute to Fergus McCabe. Given the issues we are debating, it was my intention, in coming to the Chamber, to speak about Fergus and his legacy. I have spent time in the north inner city and I know he was the type of man whose trust one would never want to lose. If one ever did lose the trust of somebody like Fergus, one would know one was doing something wrong. He had an interest in everything, including music and football. As Deputy Gannon noted, Fergus was one of the founding members of Belvedere Football Club and he was also a fan of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. It would be wonderful if Matt Doherty, a former Belvedere footballer and current Spurs player, were to do the business tonight for the Republic of Ireland in Fergus's memory.There was not a cause he ever gave up on. There was no individual he ever gave up on. He spoke passionately about the drugs issue for generations. He wrote the Gregory deal some 40 years ago and still spoke as passionately this year as he did in the early 1980s about housing, employment, drugs and education, as Deputy Gannon said, and always with a glint in his eye, always close to having a chuckle on his lips. Fergus was always articulate and forthright. It was his birthday this week. He was 71 years of age. It breaks my heart to think that we have lost so many good, decent and articulate people in that part of the world who were speaking to a better future. More recently, Fergus spent much time with young people from immigrant backgrounds, speaking to their reality and trying to find ways to empower them. It is appropriate, on a night like this, that the national Parliament would hear of the memory of Fergus McCabe. We will not get a chance to go to his funeral. We will not get a chance to say these words in a church or other place where normally we would do these things. When a person has worked so hard for those who needed him so much, for so many years, then Dáil Éireann is an appropriate place to speak of the name Fergus McCabe. I am delighted that Deputy Gary Gannon did so and I am delighted to join with the Deputy to pay tribute to him.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister said that while not her fault directly, the 2020 leaving certificate was a difficult process for all involved, not least for the students. Will the Minister facilitate an independent investigation into the entire 2020 leaving certificate, which would examine the circumstances leading to the cancellation of the written exam, the design and implementation of the calculated grades system and the errors and omissions in order that we can learn from this for the leaving certificate class of 2021?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is to be welcomed. We do not need to fall out over words such as "investigation", "inquiry" and "review" but I would be interested in knowing who the Minister intends to charge with responsibility for overseeing the independent review. I am sure she will agree that if the students of 2021 have to face the same type of system, which we all hope will not happen although we do not know what will happen in the coming months, similar mistakes should not be made. Is the Minister in a position to outline the nature of the process to appoint an independent individual to oversee the review?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy to welcome that and we are happy to work with the Minister. She inherited this situation. She has had successes. Opening up the schools has been a success. To a large degree, yesterday was a successful day for the Minister. On the staffing schedule the Minister announced yesterday, involving a reduction in the pupil–teacher ratio to 25:1, which is welcome, will the arrangement apply to DEIS primary schools? They have a different staffing schedule. The worry we have is that if the arrangement does not apply, the senior end of a primary DEIS school will have the same staffing schedule as a mainstream school. I acknowledge it is beyond the scope of this question but perhaps the Minister could revert to me on whether the reduction in the pupil–teacher ratio will be passed on to DEIS schools, which have a separate staffing schedule. If not, there will be absolute equalisation between DEIS and non-DEIS primary schools at the senior end. The Minister will agree that this is not something we could support.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The change in the pupil-teacher ratio announced on Tuesday was very welcome. I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that the power and funding of the Department of Education and Skills would be best channelled to infants in disadvantaged schools. The anomaly we have now is that no disadvantaged primary school with infants will benefit from the change in the pupil-teacher ratio because the staffing schedule for DEIS schools is different from that for mainstream schools. I ask for a change to be made as soon as possible. I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that if mainstream schools can benefit from a change in the pupil-teacher ratio from 26:1 to 25:1 it would be rather remarkable that disadvantaged schools dealing with infants only or vertical schools with infants in them would not benefit from the same change in class sizes or the pupil-teacher ratio. It is an anomaly and I am sure it is an oversight but it is deeply unfair. Will the Government correct this anomaly and ensure every school benefits from the change in the pupil-teacher ratio?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Often in these speeches, Opposition Deputies come into the House to make speeches and there is a feeling that we are going through the motions. I want to appeal to the Minister with responsibility for children, disability, equality and integration, Deputy O'Gorman, particularly as a member of the Green Party, to deal with one issue in the budget that needs to be rectified. We are living through a great sense of hopelessness at the moment but if anyone ever wants to get a sense of hope, they should walk into an average disadvantaged DEIS school and look at what those schools are achieving with infants. The average three-year-old in a DEIS school has one third the oral language capacity of an average mainstream three-year-old. The former has 400 words while the latter has 1,200. The gap in oral language is significant, even at the age of three. What disadvantaged schools are achieving with infants, young boys and girls, is huge and transformational, as the Minister knows because the Green Party is committed to education. The Labour Party has advocated for increased capitation for disadvantaged schools etc. The Government announced a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, from 26:1 to 25:1, which was welcome. That was something for which we advocated. DEIS schools are on a different staffing schedule and will not automatically get that PTR reduction.The situation now is that the only schools that will not benefit from the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios are disadvantaged schools that have infants. Every other primary school in the country is getting a reduction in pupil-teacher ratios. That is justifiable and welcome, and I am not suggesting it should not happen. In a pandemic it is important that we reduce what are the largest class sizes in Europe. I think the Minister of State will agree with me that it is utterly unfair that the only schools that will not receive a reduction in pupil-teacher ratios are those disadvantaged schools that have infants. I can make speeches about all that is wrong with the budget, rehearse all of the lines and do mock anger like anybody else can. This is something that is within the gift of the Government to fix with the stroke of a pen. I will not say it will cost nothing, but it will not cost an awful lot considering the Department of Education has a budget of €10 billion. There is a list of hurt, disappointment and point-scoring opportunities that I am foregoing. I ask that disadvantaged schools with infant classes be included. I got a kind of "Let them eat cake" response from the Minister of State's Cabinet colleague earlier today. I was told by the Tánaiste that most disadvantaged students do not attend disadvantaged schools, and that is fine. I felt that comment utterly missed the point because most people would understand that the vast majority of children who attend disadvantaged schools are acutely disadvantaged. Education is their one chance to get out of poverty. In many instances, it is their only chance to get out of grinding and spirit-crushing poverty. Education is the great liberator. If the Department of Education and Skills is making the gesture of reducing class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios, one would have thought it would have front-loaded that for infants in disadvantaged schools. Yet, it is infants in disadvantaged schools who will not benefit from this at all. After all of the discussion and debate from Ministers who sat where the Minister of State is now sitting, it would be gratifying if my simple five-minute contribution was to lead to this one change so that every school in the country and, in particular, infants in disadvantaged schools would benefit from the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios. The announcement could be made at any stage over the next period of time and would be graciously received by me, my party and those who are teaching and whose children attend schools in the system. It is my one ask. I am not trying to score political points, but I think the Minister of State will agree that it is a valid point and should be recognised.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I must tell the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, that the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, was one of the more disappointing ones I have heard in this House since February. We live in an age where one would hope that the ordinary to and fro and over and back of party-political jibing would perhaps be put to one side when there are greater issues at stake. There have been moments of great clarity from Government over a number of issues and in its ability to reach across the aisle and work with the Opposition. Even with the Dying with Dignity Bill, there was a suggestion from Government that it was possible to take the politics out of this and work on a committee-based structure for 12 months or so to try to advance the aims. It was not a perfect suggestion but at least it was an acknowledgement that there was some validity in what the Opposition was putting forward. Indeed, even with Labour's proposal on sick pay, the Government's response was that it would look into the idea for six months. That is certainly not ideal but it is not a rejection. What we did not get from the Government contributions in those debates was what we got this evening from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, which was so lacking in empathy and did not speak to any human experience whatever. It started off with a couple of political jibes. It rattled off a load of constitutional this and that and ended with a political jibe. Nowhere in it was there any mention of what type of person or living conditions does the Government feel are appropriate. If the Minister of State or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government's position was to say: "Yes, we understand your concerns about co-living because we share them and because previous to the election we said some things which you have quoted to us this evening and you are right, we did describe them as bonkers, we did describe them as tenements. We are going to work with Opposition to ensure we can, at the very least, put a halt to any new co-living applications", that is fine.We did not get that, however. We got a presentation from the Government that was, I feel, lacking in any real sense of dealing in a fair manner with what has been proposed in Sinn Féin's Bill. Of course Opposition Bills are not perfect and of course they need to be amended. Fundamentally, what we are speaking about is a housing standard. Even before the pandemic, this type of living did not make much sense as a proposal to deal with the housing crisis. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, knows that poverty and disease are often, if not always, exacerbated by housing conditions. TB in the 1940s has been mentioned when 4,000 people died a year. It affected every family in Dublin. The word "tenement" still resonates in a very negative way and sends a shiver down the spine of many Dubliners because of the muscle memory evoked by that word and where our families came from and how we lived. We improved on it. We built public housing on public land and we moved away from this type of accommodation. Now, in my constituency and in the area from where our housing spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, comes, co-living proposals are coming to the fore. There is one in Clare Hall for 122 co-living units. It has gone straight to An Bord Pleanála because the previous Government's strategic housing development legislation totally overrides the local authority. Applications go straight to An Bord Pleanála and that is where the decisions are made. It totally overrides the democratically constituted development plan of the city. Any number of housing solutions have been put forward by the Opposition in the previous Oireachtas and in this Oireachtas. The Green Party has a very strong record on sustainable housing and sustainable planning. Green Party councillors have a strong record of overseeing decency in public life when it comes to constructing these development plans. My party is the same. When it comes to a proposal for co-living housing, being so defensive and having such a defensive presentation from the Government as we did really belittles what we are trying to discuss. We are trying to discuss how people can live in a sustainable way. Many things that were untouchable in the past are being mentioned, such as the nationalisation of private hospitals, a sustainable basic universal income and a ban on evictions. We were told all of these were constitutionally questionable but they were all able to happen overnight because the pandemic demanded it. The pandemic demands that we have a higher standard of housing and it demands that a proposal such as co-living, which was always a bad idea anyway, should be absolutely ruled out in the current situation. If the Government felt strongly enough about it what we would have had this evening was a strong and robust speech from the Minister of State that told us the Government would meet us half way. The Minister of State would have said that he knew and had heard that the legislation was imperfect but that he understood from the history of the city that this type of proposal is not one the Government could stand over and that it would make sure in whatever way it possibly could that it would not proceed. He would have said that the Government regretted the applications being made but would try to do its best to go beyond a situation where co-living is deemed to be acceptable. We did not get this. When it comes to the vote on this, Government Deputies will vote the way they do, and I was once that soldier. When we walk away from the debate we will be in no way clearer as to where the compassion is in terms of the Government's housing policy. This is the real disappointment about this evening. Anybody can rattle off a speech that is spiteful and full of political point-scoring rhetoric. The people who might potentially live in this type of accommodation, and who may be forced to live in this type of accommodation, demand better from the Parliament and this political discourse. Can we all accept across the House that co-living is not a solution? Can we accept we have a problem right here and right now whereby co-living planning applications are being submitted to An Bord Pleanála? Can we accept this is a difficulty? Can we accept we should have higher housing standards for our people? Can we say we have learned the lessons of history in terms of tenement life, TB and typhoid? I am not trying to be overly emotive. I am not trying to be unfair. These are the lessons of history. Housing policy is dictated by the mistakes that were made and that we promised would not happen again. Tenement living, which many families know about, came from a situation where the property and landlord classes ran the show. We cannot return to that situation. I and the Labour Party appeal to the Minister of State and his Government colleagues. The Government could easily dismiss the type of legislation proposed by Deputy Ó Broin as playing politics, and it did, or it could find the good, the decency and the ethic behind what is being proposed as something worthy of support. Perhaps the Government will not support the Bill in the vote when it takes place but it could contextualise it by giving some hope to the Opposition and others in our society that this type of housing standard is not something it really wants to stand over and that it will take steps to ensure it will curtail it, regulate it or ensure it does not spread any more than it already has. This is the message we want to hear from the Government. The type of speech that was given by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, really was quite depressing and ill-befitting a debate on a type of housing model that is not worthy of our citizens. The Government should do better.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Tánaiste made reference to the Covid restrictions support scheme earlier. I know he was hoping for a chance to expand on the issue. The scheme is to run from 13 October. The details are to be included in the finance Bill which is to be published shortly. However, thousands of businesses are locked out from today. When will they be able to apply for the scheme? Can they apply from today? When will they receive a cash payment? As the Tánaiste knows, they have bills which must be paid immediately.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I will speak to one particular issue. My party colleagues have spoken about the measures introduced today. We have supported the measures, although we do have reservations. I will speak in the main on the issue of hand sanitisers. I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is due to make a statement to the House shortly, during this time slot. I appreciate that the schedule could not be changed and that we cannot have a discussion back and forth on the issue. I know the Dáil schedule does not allow for that. Perhaps the Minister of State might suggest to the Minister that a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be necessary next week, if one is not already scheduled. At 11 o'clock last night, schools were informed of an issue with a hand sanitising product that may have been in use in those schools. Let us take a moment to consider how hard our school communities have been working for the last two months. In fairness to the Government, schools would not have opened if it was not for the package presented at the end of July in order to facilitate the opening of schools but it also would not have happened if it was not for the work of everybody in every school community, from the boards of management down to principals, teachers, special needs assistants, secretaries, caretakers and school wardens. All did their best. Students, the young people who have been getting such unfair criticism over recent months, have been the ones maintaining goodwill and doing their best to keep schools open. They have been hit with issue after issue with regard to the leaving certificate and there are now issues with contact tracing. There is contradictory advice from the HSE to various schools as to how to handle this situation. They have had to reconfigure school buildings and have had to show goodwill in a system in which goodwill has been in short supply because of the issue of two-tier pay, the lack of basic employee rights for school secretaries and caretakers, the poor management of the redeployment of the special needs assistants, SNAs, and the other issues through which schools have been working over recent months. It now transpires that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had information about a defective hand sanitiser being used in schools on Tuesday. Children went to school on Wednesday and Thursday while this knowledge was within the Department. It was not until 11 o'clock last night that school principals were told that they needed to assess whether they could open in the morning. From a Department that has been bouncing from crisis to crisis comes another source of unnecessary anxiety for a system in which anxiety is already heightened. The Department knew on Tuesday that defective hand sanitiser was being used in schools throughout the State and did not pass this information on. The hand sanitiser that was made available is harmful to children and young people. Some of the repercussions of using it on a prolonged basis are quite serious and include respiratory problems. If the Department knew this on Tuesday and let children go to school on Wednesday and Thursday before deciding to tell people on Thursday evening, does this not again give the sense to the greater public and every school community that the Department of Education and Skills does not know what it is doing? It is firefighting all of the time and is not in a position of control. It is not demonstrating partnership and will just stumble from problem to problem. I appreciate that the Minister will speak to the House but if it transpires that the Department - I am sorry, I am having difficulty concentrating because a conversation is going on to my left.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the Department knew on Tuesday that this hand sanitiser was not safe and yet children were allowed to go to school on Wednesday and Thursday, that is very serious. There needs to be some accountability for that. We are all learning as we go and doing our best. Schools are doing their absolute best to keep children safe and to remain open under very challenging circumstances. I urge Government to be as open as it can and to find the facility for questions to be asked and answered on this matter. If this is how the school system is to be managed, there will be heightened anxiety within the system and people will worry that children are not safe and that there is not a level of partnership between the Department and schools. People will worry that we are again going to move from crisis to crisis. While I have time, I will address the Government on the wider issue of the measures that were passed today. We cannot bring people with us without a level of leadership from the political system. We cannot bring people with us if the message from Government is one of fines and Garda intervention.There is a small but, I fear, growing resentment organisation weaving different strands of extremist ideology, from anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant sentiment to anti-public service broadcasting sentiment, into these measures. We need to watch that and to be very careful it does not use what will be passed in the Dáil today and the Oireachtas as whole in the coming days as another weapon to try to get more soldiers to its flag. There have been political elements within these Houses who have been far too willing to give sympathy to conspiracy theorists over recent years. Examples are the anti-5G element and the promoters of the anti-vaccine view. Certain Members in this House, who shall remain unnamed, were quite happy to align themselves with the conspiracy theorists until it became unpalatable for everybody to align with certain ex-journalists and their extremism. As a country, we are facing a difficult winter. As a society, we need to ensure the measures voted in today will not be used against any particular part of society, demographic or age group and that they will be a last resort. Fundamentally, what we are trying to say to the people is that this is all about keeping all of us safe, and the best thing we can do is stay at home and stay safe. We can suppress this virus and ensure that, when Christmas comes, we will not have an empty chair at the table. On that, the Government has the Labour Party's full support as we continue to try to do what we can in the national interest.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is something sadly inevitable about this debate and the controversy in which the Tánaiste finds himself. I was hoping that today he would stop treating those in the political system and the people of Ireland like fools. He has chosen not to stop. His explanation is just not credible. He waltzed in here this evening and to the cheers of his party colleagues equated giving this document to his friend to exchanging documentation as part of the Northern Ireland peace process. He seems to want to paint himself as a victim. He said there is nothing inappropriate about informal contacts of this nature per se. He said that friends, acquaintances and supporters may claim to be closer to him than they really are, and that this is clearly a big part of the story. Of course it is a big part of the story. It is the entirety of the story. As Taoiseach, with the immense responsibility placed on him, the Tánaiste handed a document stamped "CONFIDENTIAL" to a friend of his who asked for it and who was the head of a rival organisation to the Irish Medical Organisation. The Tánaiste has said with a straight face that he was trying to enhance the possibility of this deal getting over the line. I want to ask the Tánaiste about the nature of his relationship with Dr. Maitiú Ó Tuathail. Has he communicated with him since the story broke on Saturday or since he became aware of it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would not be too much of a jump to suggest that either in the Tánaiste's mind or in Dr. Ó Tuathail's mind, or from the point of view of people hearing what the Tánaiste has just said, statements coming from the Tánaiste and Dr. Ó Tuathail were co-ordinated over the weekend. The Tánaiste sent out his statement after a full day of putting it together. Dr. Ó Tuathail sent out his statement the next day. The Tánaiste spoke to Dr. Ó Tuathail three times about the statements both parties were going to release.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Tánaiste's judgment is really being called into question here. He is in the middle of a huge controversy about inappropriately handing someone a document that he should not have had, and he is chatting to him about it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In a message to his colleague Dr. Ó Tuathail wrote "Leo constantly pulling strings for me. You’ve no idea". Is he over-egging the nature of his relationship with the Tánaiste? What are these strings which Dr. Ó Tuathail suggests the Tánaiste pulls for him constantly?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Tánaiste said in his speech that he finds some of the allegations against him "offensive". A lot of people in Ireland would find it offensive for the Taoiseach to give his pal a document he should not have. Let us move on. I still find it remarkable that the Tánaiste decided to make contact with this individual over the weekend. The Tánaiste sent him a document. Was anybody else involved in sending this document? 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Did the Tánaiste's PA know what was in it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Tánaiste managed to put somebody else in an impossible situation in which they were sending a document which was not for circulation. Did the Tánaiste instruct her to do this? Did he ask her to do it? He must understand what he did. The words "CONFIDENTIAL - NOT FOR CIRCULATION" were written on the document. The Tánaiste asked his PA to send it to Dr. Ó Tuathail. Did he ask her or instruct her? Was she in a position to say "No"?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is like the Northern Ireland peace process.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is according to the Tánaiste's speech. Has the Tánaiste or anyone in his office ever given a document marked "confidential" to a person or body in a manner which was "not best practice", to use the Tánaiste's own words, before this instance or since?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Earlier today the Taoiseach said that the Tánaiste said "No" to him. He also said "No" in answer to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question. When he answered my question, maybe because of the way I worded it, he said it had not happened to his knowledge. What is the Tánaiste's answer, "No" or "Not to my knowledge"?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am asking on the basis of the kind of operation he runs - his close advisers, his circle, the one or two people he has had around him for years and years. Has a confidential document been sent in a manner which was not best practice, either with or without his knowledge?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are getting a "to the best of my knowledge" answer again, whereas the Tánaiste previously stated "No" and the Taoiseach previously stated "No".
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As has been outlined, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was asked for this document and he basically said "No". Why does the Tánaiste think the Minister for Health said "No"? Why did he say "Yes"? Why did Dr. Ó Tuathail write, "To be fair. Leo always delivers"?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are a million and one holes in that tale. The NAGP was a basket case. It was not a credible organisation at that stage. The previous year, its entire council had resigned. Within weeks of the Tánaiste giving it this document, it had collapsed in on top of itself. Its motivation in getting this document was not to promote the document. That is obvious because it did not promote the document. In the words of Dr. Maitiú Ó Tuathail himself, "no doubt it will take the wind from the IMO's sails... I would love to destroy IMO too." Is it not really the case that the NAGP was falling apart? There were all sorts of questions about its corporate governance, its dealings and how it managed its affairs. It was getting desperate. As the Tánaiste has acknowledged, it began to threaten him and members of his party. The Tánaiste helped his pal who asked for the document. Either the Tánaiste is complicit or he is a stooge. Which is it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Again, the Labour Party finds utterly incredible the Tánaiste's explanation to this House and the Irish people that what he was trying to do was to promote the agreement, an agreement the NAGP did not promote among its members and which some of the NAGP members were saying it would use against the IMO. There are references in the text messages to what it was going to do with the 17 roadshows the IMO had planned. The Tánaiste stepped outside his area of responsibility. He stepped into a negotiated deal between the Minister for Health, the IMO and the HSE. It was a sensible enough agreement which was not signed off on for another month when it came to the acceptance of the members. The Tánaiste's buddy or pal, the guy with the Leo t-shirt, asked him for a copy of it and he said "Yes". Does the Tánaiste not feel that either he was reckless in his behaviour, considering the organisation with which he was involved, or that his explanation to the House this evening has no credibility whatsoever?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate very much Deputy Ó Laoghaire's accommodation. I appreciate very much the opportunity to propose this Private Members' Bill. It is good that Opposition Members get an opportunity to bring forward legislation on this matter and to engage with the Minister on this basis. The Labour Party feels very strongly about this Bill. We feel very strongly about education and equality. When one campaigns for equality one is not campaigning because one thinks it is fashionable. One campaigns for equality because one believes in one's Republic. The word, "Republic" is tossed around a lot. People call themselves republicans all over the world. A republic does not mean the absence of a monarchy. A republic means that every child has the same opportunities regardless of who they are or where they are from. Everybody knows that in the past 100 years of this Republic, we have not lived up to that. That does not mean we should not try.  There is no greater thief in Irish society of the Republic than poverty and disadvantage. Poverty steals childhoods. It steals dreams. It steals aspirations. It steals futures. The great liberator from that theft is education. People will ask us and other political parties here why we felt so strongly about school profiling when the leaving certificate controversy was happening. The Minister, in fairness to her, moved on the issue of school profiling because what was in essence at stake was the beautiful anonymity that a young person had of walking into a hall with a student number and nobody knew who they were, the accent they used, their address or who their parents, or grandparents, were.  There is a sense sometimes in Irish society, which may be more powerful than people in this Chamber are willing to admit, of the old school tie. I refer to the question, "What school did you go to?" and the identity, the power and the influence that comes with that. It identifies one as somebody. In some circumstances, that identification lasts for life. For others, it is not that important but how can a school admissions policy be fair to a child whose parents did not go to secondary school - I know people think that is something that happened in the past but it is not true - or somebody whose parents did not go to a secondary school in the locality or in the country when, in an over-subscribed scenario where a school has to choose between that child and another, that the school the child's parents, or even grandparents, went to will come into consideration? Every time we talk about educational disadvantage or reforming education or look around the world for better standards of education or changing things in Irish education in terms of literacy, equality or standards, we always look to Finland. The difference with Finland is not just about the money they put into education or the resources available to them. It is that they fundamentally believe that equality should underpin their system.  Nobody separates children like the Irish do. We are obsessed with it. We have 4,000 schools in a country with a population the size of Manchester. We separate them by religion, by gender, completely disproportionately in the European context, and by income in certain circumstances. This section of this Act means we can separate on the basis of parents and grandparents. That does violence to the idea of a republic. I appreciate the Minister's words but it is not good enough to say that there is no evidence that anybody has used this section of the Act and that we do not know if anybody is doing it. If that is the case, why is it in the Act? It is in the Act because of the lobbying of a certain section of the education system. We know this to be true. There are certain vested interests in Irish education, particularly at second level, who want this section in the Act because they want to keep the royal bloodline of succession within their schools. They want to be able to count on the income of the parents, and the grandparents, of past pupils for fundraising. It is as stark as that. They want to keep the identity of their school in Irish society. It is the reportedly old school boy phenomenon, although it is a old school girl phenomenon as well. "What school did you go to? My father went there. My grandfather went there." If a child's father, mother or grandparents did not go to second level, why should they be at a disadvantage? The system should almost turn itself over to facilitate somebody whose parents or grandparents did not go to second level. Surely a child whose parents are from outside the area, or the country, should be at the top of our priority list in terms of cherishing and lifting that child because that girl or boy lives in a republic. A republic means it does not matter who their parents or grandparents are. There are many issues we will talk about in these Chambers when it comes to education. There are many issues on which we will agree and disagree. There are many issues we will try to promote. We will have many justifiable arguments but surely, some of the basic things we should agree in this Chamber is that we live in a Republic and we stand by that Republic. It is not just a word. It is an ethos. It is an ethic, and it goes through everything we do. Any section or subsection of any legislative measure that comes into this House should have the litmus test of standing by that Republic. I know almost exactly what my colleagues are going to say. I know exactly what the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin are going to say. They are going to agree with this Bill. I appreciate the Minister is not coming in here to advocate for it to be voted down in its entirety but I submit to her that it would be in the proper republican tradition of her party, and of this House, for her to re-engage with her Cabinet colleagues to assess again the ethic behind the Bill and what we are trying to achieve and to realise that when it comes to trying to give children equal access it should appal us that there would ever be a legal right for any school to say to one parent over another, "I'm terribly sorry but this parent, and his father, attended this school and on that basis we can turn your child away". They should not have a legal right to do that. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act allows them to do that. The section of that Act should be deleted. The Minister probably agrees with me.Between now and Wednesday next, when we have the vote, it would be best if we all agreed the section needs to go and if we did not hide behind reviews, as the Minister is suggesting. The word "republic" is oft used and oft abused but it is something that is special and sacred and that we should stand by.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to state genuinely my appreciation to my colleagues from Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats who have attended this evening for taking part in the debate and, indeed, my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, who proposed the Bill. It is gratifying to know that people feel similarly across the Opposition benches about an issue of equality and of education. I very much appreciate the Minister's attendance. There has been a practice sometimes of Ministers of State coming in for such business. The Minister is present and I very much appreciate that. It would have been illuminating, possibly, to hear other Government voices and their views on the Bill, but that is how it is. Part of the reason we have such an objection to this part of the Act is because of who is asking for it. It is being asked for by a particular vested interest group, the fee-paying second level sector. They are the ones who asked for it, and they got it. It goes against any sense of justice I have that a particularly powerful vested interest gets what it wants when it comes to Irish education in the form of an admissions Bill.That is wrong. It was stated eloquently earlier that one might imagine a disadvantaged child who has all these things to overcome, whose parents are early school leavers and who battles his or her way through the DEIS system. The Minister mentioned DEIS and I just want to remind her that her cut in pupil-teacher ratio does not transfer automatically to all DEIS schools. I hope she rectifies that between now and next September. Some children have oral, language and dietary issues. There are also the drugs issues that are sometimes in their communities, the housing issues and the way society looks down upon the way they speak. Some children and the way they speak are depicted in the media as if they are either untrustworthy or stupid. Children know and feel this and are aware of it from an early age. They battle their way through primary school and all those obstructions between them and maximising their potential, a lack of resources, etc. They finally make their way to secondary school and a scenario can legally exist whereby a principal can say to the parents of that child that he or she is terribly sorry but the school has 25% of its intake set aside for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. What kind of message is that to send to that family? It is a pretty powerful message that it does not really matter what a person tries to do. There will always be a State-sanctioned legal reason to put a person back in his or her box. The Minister can say that we do not know how often it is being invoked and that it may be too difficult to take it out. If we have learned anything from the past number of months, however, it is that it actually is not that difficult. I know from my time in government, and it was brief enough, that if it is important enough and the people it affects are powerful enough, it can be done immediately. The Minister is not criticising the ethics of or intention behind Bill. I appreciate that. I appreciate her bona fides when it comes to education but can we agree this should never have been inserted in the first place? We are just trying to take out something that should not have been there. That is all. They came, they asked and they got their way. That is all, except they should not have got their way. As I said before, in a republic or in any sort of admissions Bill or legislation that tries to enhance the opportunities of children, it should not matter where or if a person's parents went to school. There is a list of minority groups set down in the existing legislation against which a school is not allowed to discriminate. There are, however, a disproportionate number of Traveller children whose parents did not attend secondary school. Of course, there are a disproportionate number of migrant children whose parents did not attend secondary school in the State, never mind those from disadvantaged backgrounds whose parents or grandparents may not have attended secondary school. There are three groups, off the top of my head, who need education more than anybody else because they have no other route out of poverty. Boys and girls who attend private schools will be fine. They will make their way and they will be grand. For the children to whom I refer, education is their one chance - it is the great liberator. The Minister knows that. Yet, children must compete for places in oversubscribed schools with those whose parents or grandparents attended such schools. The Minister knows and I know that is wrong. This Bill will not change the world; that is not the intention behind it. What it tries to do, however, is call out over-influence in these Houses by a group of people who get what they want. They come to these Houses, ask for something and get it. They expect to get it. As Deputy Gannon quite rightly said, if Pavee Point, the National Women's Council of Ireland, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland or another interest group that tries to advocate for the rights of those who do not have the same power walked in and asked for something like the admissions Bill, would they get it as readily and as quickly? Could they walk into the corridors of power and get a section into a Bill as readily and as easily and then have somebody like the Minister stand up and defend it? That was the interesting thing about the Minister's contribution. She did not actually defend it, she just stated that it would be too difficult or too onerous to take it out immediately. That is her defence. There is, therefore, no defence for the relevant section. The Minister does not have a defence for the section. This is what we are talking about here. There is a wider issue in Irish society that relates to influence and power: who has it and who does not; who uses it and who wields it; and who gets it and who gets things done because they can. It is not just about politics, it is about businesses. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire stated, these are all facets of Irish life. The people to whom I refer know each other. They play golf together. They talk about the old days in school together and ensure that they enshrine in legislation that this can continue from one generation to the next. We are suggesting that we must focus our attention on the children and families that do not have this kind of power. That needs to be the cornerstone of our belief system in the Republic. It is offensive to me that such a moneyed, influential and powerful education lobby gets its way. The existing legislation was passed by the Dáil and the Seanad. We put down the amendment at the time that was supported in the Seanad by Sinn Féin and other Opposition groups - not the Minister's party, I must say - in order that this would not be enacted in the first place. We outlined to the then Minister the reasons we were against it. We told him why it was wrong. Our argument was dismissed and the legislation was enacted. As others have stated, politics does not have to be this way. It does not have to be about us versus Government and having a row and scoring points off each other. It does not have to be about bringing in other issues and trying to pretend to the public we have all the answers and that the Minister is making nothing but mistakes, because that is not true. It is just not accurate. The Government works hard and has decent people within it trying to achieve things for the people. I absolutely accept that and people in opposition are similar when legislation that is well-intentioned is brought forward by the Social Democrats, Sinn Féin or the Labour Party. As one accepts, not every item of legislation from Opposition is well-intended. Obviously, sometimes there is game playing and grandstanding. That happens a lot. We accept that. The Minister has accepted, however, that is not the case here. She must accept that when it comes to Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats or other groups in this Chamber, it is often not the case. She has accepted this evening that it is not the case. In light of that, would it be possible, between now and next Wednesday, to come to a position whereby the Minister will take a different approach to the Bill, namely, that the relevant section of the Act can be deleted because we are starting afresh and because, in post-Covid Ireland, we will have a different mindset about how our public institutions and schools can be run?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There seems to be a level of confusion about the Department of Education's interpretation of HSE guidelines with regard to special needs assistants, SNAs, and face coverings insofar as a school does not have to provide medical grade face masks for SNAs outside of intimate care settings. The Minister will agree that our special needs assistants are doing sterling work. They are on the front line and need adequate protection. Will the Minister ensure the Minister for Health engages with the Minister for Education and the Fórsa trade union to ensure the adequate protections are provided in classrooms for special needs assistants as they do their best to keep our schools open?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Government is asking us to vote confidence in the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Government is asking us to accept his explanation for his behaviour in leaking a confidential document to a friend and head of a rival representative body, completely outside of normal procedure and appropriate practice, during a multi-million euro negotiation process. The Labour Party told the Tánaiste to come clean, to tell the truth, to dispense with the incredible yarn he had been peddling and to apologise, and perhaps there may have been a way out for him. However, the Tánaiste chose not to do that. He persisted with the line that he was leaking the document for the good of the document, a statement that takes the entire country for fools. Then, his cheerleaders go on the public airwaves and repeat the same lines. One Minister even suggested that the word “confidential” was printed on the document for the benefit of Dr. Ó Tuathail. The question is not only should the Dáil have confidence in him, but should any trade union have confidence that they can negotiate with this Government in good faith, or should any Minister have confidence that they can share a confidential document with the Tánaiste in good faith. The fact is, in all honesty, they cannot.  We also have no confidence in the Minister because he has shown no interest in protecting the rights of workers throughout this pandemic. When sectoral pay agreements were struck down by the High Court, my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, introduced emergency legislation to reinstate them, and the Tánaiste dismissed this move as “virtue signalling”. When the Labour Party introduced a statutory sick pay Bill, the Tánaiste and his Government colleagues kicked it down the road for six months. When ICTU walked out of the Low Pay Commission after it advocated a paltry 10 cent increase in the minimum wage, the Tánaiste accepted the increase without question. The same week, he humiliated a public official and NPHET on national television and dismissed their recommendation because they had not thought things through. The Debenhams workers and others have been screaming for the implementation of the Duffy Cahill report, to which he is clearly indifferent. We are quite sure the Bill we launched today on working from home and the right to switch off will be treated with similar disdain by the same Minister. So, we have no confidence in the Tánaiste. He is not a friend of the worker and now appears not to be a friend of transparent politics. The Labour Party has spent generations championing ethics in public life. From freedom of information legislation and lobbying legislation to tackling corporate donations, Labour has worked tirelessly to clean up politics from the grubby dealings of others. Not one Labour politician has ever faced any accusation of improper behaviour at any tribunal of inquiry. Labour knows what it is like to have to run against Fianna Fáil money, to have to run against Fine Gael money and to have to run against Sinn Féin money. Sinn Féin now wants to present itself as the ethical left. It says it wants to stand against insider politics and the old boys' club. We in the Labour Party offer it some advice. It is not good enough to describe a convicted tax cheat as a good republican because he is a member of their old boys' club. It is not good enough to accept £4 million from England to fund political activity in Ireland and then to move it around so they do not have to pay tax on it. It is not good enough to take racist American money from bigoted Trump supporters like Congressman Pete King of New York, who was one of the architects of the Muslim ban, but who supports Sinn Féin - an insider, one of your old boys' club. It is not good enough to have the Northern Minister for Finance send documents of the renewable heat initiative to one of its own insiders and member of the old boys' club in Belfast before it got sign-off. Ethics in public life is important, not just when it is somebody else's old boys' club but when it is your own. This debate suits both Sinn Féin and Fine Gael.They want the public to think politics in Ireland is a choice between the Varadkar conservatives and populist nationalism. It is not. There are enough of us in this Chamber who want to focus on the dignity of the worker and the eradication of homelessness, poverty and Covid-19 and who value the liberation of education and the well-being of all our people. We will continue to work with others to bring honour and ethics to Irish politics. Despite often harsh words between us, we have confidence in many individuals and groupings in this Oireachtas. That confidence does not extend to the Tánaiste.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion, which the Labour Party will support. I appreciate that the Minister will be sympathetic regarding the issue being raised. There are often calls for tough Garda action regarding what happens in communities, including action against parents, young people and those who sell scramblers and quad bikes. That has to happen and the gardaí need to empowered. We also need to understand the rationale behind why, in certain communities, this is considered to be a good use of one's time. What is often lost when we debate any sort of social ill is that we think we can police our way out of it. Policing our way out of a situation is, of course, a part of the solution. There must be a justice element involved, because a dangerous machine cannot be handed to a child, one cannot purchase something which one knows to be dangerous, and one cannot drive such a machine in a dangerous fashion. We all know that, so there must rules, regulations and restrictions laid down. We must also understand the mentality as to why this is so attractive and why so many young people feel that this is a good use of their time. That is something which can be drilled into if it is accepted, and as was advocated for in the last Oireachtas and accepted by the Minister's party, that there is a need for a different way of policing, of engaging with communities and of understanding communities and young people. In the Dublin 5, Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 area, we have advocated for a Mulvey-style commission to engage with all the different actors in the community, so that we will not just talk to the Garda when it comes to issues such as scrambler bikes, anti-social behaviour, drug dealing or drug taking. We need to try to get in behind the statistics in terms of why these things happen. Why do young people feel empowered by this sort of activity? What is it that gives them their kicks? Why are those kicks not found somewhere else?  If there really is a passion for and an interest in the motor, the noise or the power, could we facilitate that in some kind of safe way? These questions and answers can be tossed and turned over and back with those actors in the community who know best. The Minister's Government agreed that we should have such a Mulvey-style commission for the northside of Dublin. One was agreed for Drogheda as well. We feel strongly that we are wasting an awful lot of time without having these kinds of discussions. It should not take a Deputy in the Opposition to bring forward this issue again and again for the Government to act not just on this issue, but on a wide variety of issues which are underpinned by a sense of disengagement, disconnection and disfranchisement. It is very difficult to stand up in a community and speak about disconnection and disenfranchisement when someone is clearly engaging in violent anti-social behaviour with a motorised vehicle which is creating great noise and distress in that community. We must, however, have that conversation on some level, and that would be the type of forum in which these issues could be teased out. I am sure if we talk to youth workers, as we all do in our different communities, they would say that we need tighter restrictions and regulations and that we must also talk to parents about how in God's name they think it is sensible to hand a dangerous machine to a child. We must go a little bit beyond that as well, however, and talk about what is happening in these communities as to why young people feel that the power they get from making this noise makes them feel important. There must be a space for that conversation.  I take the opportunity to speak about the commitment of the Government and the assistant commissioner to establish a Garda station in the Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 area. I still feel strongly about that issue and want to work with the Minister to ensure it can be built. It will not solve every problem. We cannot put a Garda station in every area of disadvantage and expect that to solve all the issues. It would, however, give that hugely expanding area of Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 a sense that community infrastructure is being put in place, which most communities of that size would expect.  We support this motion and tough action against scrambler and quad bikes, but we must have a deeper discussion on what the motivation is behind young people needing to feel empowered by this type of activity. That type of conversation is worthy of us.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The very point of the existence of the Labour Party is to protect the worker against exploitation. Protecting the worker means that, as times and circumstances change, legislation has to change. Things do not stay the same. That is why when we bring forward proposed legislation in the House it is always with an eye on the worker, the reality of the vulnerability of many people who are at work and that often employees can be exploited. There is no greater exploitation than to insist that workers never stop working, always have to be switched on and are constantly under some kind of employer surveillance and must answer emails, be at the end of the phone and be constantly contactable and have to second guess whether they can spend free time with family, children, leave the house or even go on holiday, which, it is to be hoped, can happen again soon. This always on culture is incredibly corrosive. It is very difficult for people to manage the terms of their mental health. It means people are never free of their employer. They cannot really have a work-life balance. Rather, they work and work and work from the moment they wake up. In the modern world the first thing people probably do before they even turn to their partner is look at their phone. For many people in work, a message will be waiting to be answered. When an email comes in in the evening, there is an expectation that it will be answered. If people do not answer a call or an email or respond to communication from an employer there are consequences. The chances of advancement in a job will be curtailed. The feeling is that people have to be responsive and always be in a position to answer. That is not good for anybody's productivity, work-life balance or a society or a country that is trying to raise a society that is at ease with itself. It is not good that all people who are trying to have a fully rounded existence do is work.  This is not just a Monday to Friday phenomenon; it is all the time. It involves weekends. If emails, messages or phone calls come in on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday the expectation is that they must be responded to. Junior employees on low wages want to protect their jobs and career advancement. There has to be an absolute right in legislation to switch off. Only a few countries in the European Union have this right, but Ireland has to legislate for the right to switch off. Workers have a right to not always have to be working. Workers have a right to free time. They should be able to put a phone or laptop away or close down a computer without feeling that they will lose out in terms of their employment advancement prospects. We can have legislation, but employers will know that while there may be a right not to answer an email an employee will feel that he or she has to. Employers have to have policies laid down by legislation to ensure that employees can point to the policies and say that they were working within company policy and they did not respond to an email or phone call. If people were to respond to an email or phone call, that would be designated as work and people would be paid for it accordingly. We could have a much more productive society that would work better for employees and employers if there was a basic right to switch off. In terms of remote working, we are again lagging behind many of our EU colleagues in not having legislation to cover this area. As stated by my party leader, Deputy Alan Kelly, the number of people working from home has grown from 200,000 at the beginning of the year to 800,000 at this point.  It is the more vulnerable workers who we are worried about, namely, people who are working at the end of a bed, in a bedroom that they may share with a sibling or in an overcrowded space. Socialisation in work, workplace mingling, sharing stories and coffee culture will be important for many people as they go out into the world. They are losing out on that, which is very unfortunate.  We have to have protections for younger workers. Employers have to step up and ensure employees are protected or have the resources within their homes in order to do their work to a sufficient standard. Far too many children in this country do their homework at the end of stairs or lying on their stomachs in front of the television due to overcrowding. That is also the reality for many of our workers. As we move forward, try to battle our way through this pandemic, rebuild our economy and consider a post-Covid Ireland, that is where the attention of the Government needs to turn in terms of how we will reconstruct our society and economy once the pandemic has subsided.Are we just going to revert back to where we were? One of the tragedies of the last crisis was that we just went back to where we were, which was certainly the case with the housing market. I plead with Government not to make the same mistake again. Huge societal issues have been exposed by this pandemic that need to be rectified and a radical approach to this is going to be necessary. It may be desirable in the future that many people will work from home. This would ensure that many of our rural towns will keep their young people, will ensure that this drift to large urban centres is not necessary, will ensure that we do not have this crazy traffic gridlock every day in many other urban centres and if it is their wish and their wont workers can legitimately work from home in the future. This is something that may be desirable from an environmental perspective but we have to have laws, regulations and legislation laid down in order to protect and encourage workers and to also encourage employers in that scenario. We ask that the Tánaiste might instil some vision into Government policy to look forward into this post-Covid-19 space about how our economy and workers might work. In summary, the Labour Party wants, as always, to protect the worker. As work and employment practices change we want to protect those employees. We cannot have a situation where the only way people can live their lives effectively and earn a salary is never to stop working. We cannot stand over that. Unfortunately, in our party, we view the potential for employers to exploit is very high which is not something that we say lightly. It is our experience and the experience of many people on our side of the argument that employers have a chequered history of exploitation when it comes to the worker if they are allowed get away with it. This new phenomenon of always being “on” is a classic example of where an employer has an opportunity to squeeze more and more out of a worker. The only chance outside of a trade union - we know that we have restricted trade union and collective bargaining rights in Ireland - is that the State would do something in order to protect workers. The Labour Party exists in order to provide a legislative backing to the trade union movement. It is why we are here, is why we introduce legislation like this and why we hope the Government will look at it in a positive manner, unlike other legislation we have brought forward. Workers have the right to switch off and to have protections under law when they work from home.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I raised this issue with the Minister yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. At the outset I must state that the Department's treatment of SNAs has been appalling over the most recent period in terms of the lack of respect shown to them. I refer to the redeployment debacle, the issues around face coverings and then, when there is an ongoing discussion between the Department and the Fórsa trade union over the issue of these 72 hours, with the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, a letter arrived last week detailing issues referred to in Circular 0071/2011. At the end of that letter, the Department says that disciplinary procedures are available to employers under the same circular in the event of the failure of an SNA to perform a contractual obligation. I am blue in the face listening to political representatives saying every day of the week that teachers are heroes, SNAs are heroes and every front-line worker is a hero. At the same time the Department issues a threatening letter regarding the 72 hours that it feels SNAs should be doing outside of their ordinary working day. We are in the middle of a pandemic and the Department knows that these 72 hours are controversial. We know that it is a contractual requirement for SNAs to fulfil these 72 hours but it is understandable that the trade union would suggest that these 72 hours are not required in a level 4 or level 5 scenario because being in a school or workplace setting is not safe for those workers. Into that mix, the Department predictably makes a bags of its communication to patron bodies and individual school principals. This letter needs to be withdrawn and the Department needs to apologise for it. The Minister must state quite categorically in this Chamber that no SNA is required to do any hours outside of contact work with vulnerable students during a restrictive lockdown such as level 4 or level 5.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister made reference to agreements made in 2005 and a circular issued in 2011. We were not in the middle of a pandemic in 2005 or 2011. There is no recognition from her Department that things have radically changed and that schools would not be open if it were not for special needs assistants. There must be some accommodation by the Department of the need for flexibility at this time. I have said before that if one is not a teacher or a building, the Department does not know what to do with one. There is an incredible inability to be in any way flexible. I will put my question to the Minister again. Does she expect SNAs to go into their workplace outside of contact hours and complete the 72 hours? Any reasonable and rational person would suggest that during periods of level 4 and 5 restrictions, which are considered to be very at-risk scenarios for everyone, this is an unreasonable expectation of SNAs.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have submitted this question on behalf of my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, who is the Labour Party spokesperson on housing. The Minister will be aware that the issue of co-living has been raised regularly in these Houses. We spoke on a motion on this issue recently. We very much welcome the statement on co-living the Minister reportedly made yesterday. Perhaps he is in a position to outline his stance and what effect it will have.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My party welcomes the Minister's decision. His statements on this matter in opposition had been categorical and he has delivered on them as Minister. This could be an example of the Opposition and Government working effectively together. Is it the view of the Minister's officials that this decision will need to be underpinned by legislation in due course? Is there a suggestion it might be open to challenge? What will happen to planning applications that are currently being adjudicated by An Bord Pleanála? Applications for such developments in the south inner city and in Donaghmede in my constituency are currently under consideration.The Minister's instruction has gone to An Bord Pleanála. Does his order have an effect on adjudications An Bord Pleanála may currently be making on applications?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We appreciate that and, again, it is something we welcomed yesterday when we saw the report. I have a quick question. If a number of planning applications were to be successful, if An Bord Pleanála were to rule that co-living, because of the previous guidelines, should be accepted in these cases, what measures does the Minister think would be within his powers to move against that? Do we just have to accept that these came and were given permission under previous guidelines and that is just the way it is or is there some kind of regulation he could bring in to monitor and have some kind of oversight over that type of accommodation? It is one thing to rule out everything that will happen from now on but to try to oversee the building standards that currently exist is another. As such, is there some way we can ensure that if something does get permission we are not behind the curve, that we are preparing for that eventuality? Is that something the Minister has thought about, is it something his officials are considering? I ask because we could have a situation where, notwithstanding the Minister's position on this, we have a number of co-living apartments or dwellings on stream in a very short period.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«During debates of this kind, we often find ourselves strongly advocating for a Bill and strongly opposing the position of the Government. As the previous speaker indicated, however, thankfully we are in a position whereby the Bill tabled by Deputy O'Reilly is not being opposed by the Government and, therefore, can advance to the next stage when, hopefully, it can be improved, amended or whatever on Committee Stage. I am slightly confused, notwithstanding the goodwill of the Minister of State and the Government, as to the issues he has with the Bill. In his contribution, he stated that, effectively, he does not want the message to get out to the wider public that such reporting mechanisms do not exist and that, on one level, there is not really a need for the Bill. Then, however, he details reasons there are problems with the Bill because what it tries to achieve is not workable, which undermines his statement that it is already being done. There is also the question of privacy issues. I am interested in the issue and I am interested in the reasons given by the Minister of State. I often believe there can be validity to Government statements on these issues, even though at first glance they may not appear to have validity. This is the kind of thing that would be debated over and back on Committee Stage. To be fair to the proposer of the Bill, this has been kicking around since June. I know a reference has been made to the specific nature of Covid-19 and perhaps it should be broader to have longer lasting standing on the Statute Book. At the same time, I often think Bills which come before this House which are short, sharp, to the point, and want to achieve a specific outcome have a better chance of success. On that basis, I am glad the Government is not opposing the Bill. Effectively, what the Bill is trying to do, as Deputy O'Reilly has outlined on a number of occasions, is to protect workers. As Deputy Lawless said, we do not always need to have an argument over these issues or to try to put people in different trenches. However, on the entire issue of the pandemic and the post-Covid economy that we will rebuild, we come at this from the position of the worker who is vulnerable. In that regard, as the Minister of State knows, we have been proposing legislation on sick pay, and he has previously made the point that it is hoped legislation will come forward in March. At the same time, when the Labour Party proposed the sick pay Bill, the suggestion was that within 12 months, we would get some movement on that and, therefore, in the teeth of a pandemic, when so many other elements have been seen to move quickly, and when we are pretty much an outlier among EU and OECD countries by not having statutory sick pay for workers, that there would be that lag and lack of immediacy around the provision of sick pay is disappointing. The Minister of State will be aware of the Labour Party legislation that we proposed just last month on the right to switch off for people working from home. While working from home has benefits for home life and for the environment, when we move from having 200,000 people working from home to 800,000 in less than a year, we need to have regulation and protections for those workers, so they do not feel as if they are not just working from home but living in an office. I come from a professional background of teaching in a disadvantaged school, where it was often my responsibility to inform the wider society of the reality of what it is like to live and try to learn in an overcrowded space, and to do homework on the stairs, on the floor or on the edge of a bed. Now, workers are being expected by employers to do the very same thing without any oversight, without added protections and without any investment into that workspace by employers. As Deputy O'Reilly said, an outbreak of Covid- 19 in the workplace environment, outside of the working from home space, is the point of the Bill and, therefore, there is validity in what she is trying to say. Between what the Minister of State has contributed, what the Bill is trying to achieve and what we are all trying to achieve in protecting workers, we can probably find some common ground on Committee Stage. We certainly cannot return to where we were. I want to make a point, as I promised I would do every time I get the opportunity to engage on issues of employment rights, workers’ rights, the enterprise agenda, the business agenda or any economic debate in this House, on the number of workers in the economy prior to the pandemic who were very vulnerable, in insecure work and on poor pay. The rights of those workers to have their union representation recognised and to have employers engage with that union representation is weak in this country, which is the reason we have a disproportionate number of workers in insecure work and on poor pay. The Minister of State will be sick of me saying that the beauty of coming from a teaching background is that I have learned to say things over and over again and, hopefully, at some stage, it might work its way in between the ears of the students. In this regard, she is my student while I have the floor. If we had 23% of workers in the pre-Covid economy on low pay, that is not something we can stand over, and he will agree with that. It is something we have to work to amend and to ensure we do not return to. If 40% of workers under 30 are in insecure work, that is something we cannot stand over either. We cannot just assume that what we want to achieve is to get back to where we were. With the talk of the vaccine, the talk of Christmas and the talk of normality, there is a sense that if we just go back to where we were, everything will be fine. We had this in the previous crisis ten years ago, when we said we would never go through a housing crash or a boom and bust cycle again, and we would never let housing crack our people. Sure enough, ten years later, it is housing which is hurting our people, families and communities. In this sense, from the Labour Party perspective, I want to work with the Minister of State and the Government to ensure we do not return to where we were, with such a low pay economy and with young workers in such insecure work, and then having to introduce legislation, which we would have assumed was already on the Statute Book, to deal with the issues of remote working, working from home and sick pay. With that, I appreciate what Deputy Lawless said about it being worthy for us to ensure people watching debates like this do not have to pick a side, pick a team or fly a flag, and that they are able to believe that politicians can be of equal mind in trying to protect workers and to achieve something out of this. On that basis, the fact the Minister of State is not opposing the Bill and is willing to work with Deputy O'Reilly on Committee Stage speaks well of tonight's debate. We will see what happens on Committee Stage and we will also see what happens when it comes to the Government's consideration of sick pay and the right to switch off with regard to remote working.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome this legislation.In an era in which members of the public only ever see politics in an adversarial way, with its over and back, criticisms, bun-fighting, drama and theatre, I believe Deputies on both sides of this House should be proud of tonight's proceedings. We have a progressive piece of legislation from Sinn Féin in the names of Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald that was first moved a year ago. It today comes to the House for a Second Reading and the Minister gave a generous response to the legislation and has received sanction from the Cabinet to move on the measures within the Bill. There may be a small level of disagreement as to how best to proceed but politics works best when the Government shows a level of generosity towards a piece of legislation from the Opposition. I know that the Minster for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is working well with my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill. We can work collaboratively to improve the lives of the people who sent us here to work for them. I will refer to a study that issued on 25 November from Women's Aid. It contains a national survey that gives a picture of the seriousness of the issue that has already been outlined by many Deputies this evening. Ms Sarah Benson of Women's Aid said:The findings of this national survey show us that we have particularly alarming levels of intimate relationship abuse experienced by young women in this country. One fifth of young women said they experienced abuse which included emotional abuse, physical violence and sexual assault, stalking and harassment. Based on our 2016 CSO data this is as many as 44,540 young women (18-25) which is shocking. Even more troubling is the fact that 51% of young women who had suffered abuse said that it began before their 18th birthday, with just 18 years old being the average age at which the abuse began. Often when Opposition spokespersons stand up, they speak of a lack of movement from Government parties on an issue. That cannot be said in this case because the Domestic Violence Act 2018 has proved quite successful. From what I have heard from the agencies to whom I have spoken and the people involved in this sector, there is not really a call to fill legislative gaps, this legislation aside. Rather, there are issues within the system, including the courts system. Court issues remain such as the fact that a different judge in family law courts often presides over a particular issue within a case. Funding and resources can be patchy from county to county, as the Minister will appreciate. There is potential there for us to work better. This is an issue of power. It is a gendered issue and I think it is fair to say that men are the majority of the problem here. I listened with great interest to what Deputy Carroll MacNeill had to say about the cultural background to the issue. She mentioned how it can feel to drop one's children to school and hope that there will be some element of education within the school building to challenge this type of dynamic and power imbalance. All of us have to challenge some of the norms that we have inherited in this country and see if they stand up to scrutiny.  I have touched on the following issue before and there does not seem to be much of an appetite to change what I am about to speak to. We should be serious about eliminating all the elements in our society that lead to gender inequality and situations where there can be a warped sense of power, particularly within men. That has not been confined to history and anybody who speaks on an issue that predominantly affects women will be contacted by men of all generations who have a warped sense of their role in society. We have a disproportionate number of schools in Ireland that are segregated on a gender basis. Some 17% of Irish primary school children attend single-gender primary schools. That is not a huge amount but it is completely out of kilter with the European norm. One third of our second level schools are single gender. Nobody can convince me that part of the problem is not the fact that we disproportionately separate children on the basis of their gender in the education system. The Department has not given sanction to a new single-gender school since 1998. It is not Department policy to give any new school that status and it has not happened for more than 20 years. However, one third of young people attend second level schools that are either all-male or all-female.  What people say to me when they try to defend the system is that girls do better in all-girl settings. That, at least, is the accepted, passed-down understanding of why they should be supported. I think that assumption is open to challenge because what happens with all-male and all-female second level school settings is that these issues of domestic violence, power, sexual assault and image-based sexual assault among young people cannot be challenged when students are being taught in two different buildings and not learning in the same space. A toxic masculinity can grow in a single-gender male school. I am not in any way suggesting that every school is like this, or that it is not called out in all-male second level schools, or that considerable efforts are not being made in all our educational facilities to stamp out this type of toxic viewpoint or attitude. However, when compared with progressive countries in Europe and around the world, the idea of unquestioningly pursuing this accepted norm of separating children on the basis of gender does not stand up to scrutiny. It leads to a society that is very gendered and views the other gender with a slight level of curiosity or insecurity. It leaves people lacking an ability to interact properly. Within that can arise a situation where power and dominance are sought. An entire school that is built around a dressing room culture of what boys say to boys and young men say to young men has to be challenged. I do not say this in order to be provocative or destructive. I say it because it is worthy of us to always drill down into the root causes of toxic masculinity and explore why the issue appears to be getting worse in Ireland. Women's Aid has illustrated that many young women are suffering. People born since the year 2000 are going through this so it is not an old phenomenon that we are still dealing with from old attitudes. I have no idea how much time I have left.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will repeat what I have said. It is incredibly refreshing to be here this evening and witnessing what is being achieved by the Government and the Opposition together. What the Minister is doing with legislation around image-based sexual assault and the various different issues around that is refreshing. We hope it will be called "Coco's law". More of this is needed. It is worthy of us to better drill down into the State-sponsored segregation of genders in our school system, to challenge it and try to find ways to overcome it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Once again we find ourselves in a situation of good politics, where an Opposition Bill is not being opposed by the Government. The ethic within the Bill from Deputy Ó Broin and what he is attempting to achieve are to be applauded. The Deputy accepts that the Bill is not perfect and the Minister has pointed out some of the issues he has with it. Not opposing it and allowing it to go to the next Stage allows all of us to improve the Bill. Effectively, this is an acceptance that not only do we have to discuss the issue of homelessness and debate the troubling statistics that are in front of us, but also discuss how we prevent people from going into homelessness in the first place. That is often the more challenging and difficult discussion and politics can shy away from it because it leads us to ask our society some very troubling questions that we do not like to ask ourselves or find answers to. It was said to me a number of years ago that the issue was not as we used to find it, with those who have addiction issues ending up in homelessness, but that those in homelessness are now turning to addiction. The issue of addiction is something with which we have to come to terms in a better way. It has been reported this week that 2,600 children will be writing letters to Santa from hotel rooms, homeless hubs and bed and breakfast accommodation. I am minded to turn to the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil. At a time when people like to turn their minds to what happened 100 years ago, sometimes we forget some of the words that were spoken at that time about the responsibilities of a republic. We turn sometimes to militaristic language, as people across in the UK are now doing as regards protecting fish, and we speak here of our own militarised past. Tom Johnson wrote this in the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil: It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter ... Those words were written and spoken in 1919. Tonight's debate gives us an opportunity to step back from the other overarching crises with which we are dealing, between Brexit and Covid, and to speak again about the issue that dominated the general election in February of this year, which was housing and homelessness. The Minister mentioned the figure of €218 million. That is to be welcomed and we want to work with him to ensure that money is well spent. Inner City Helping Homeless reported in October that 50 homeless deaths had occurred this year, compared with 37 at the same point in 2019. There are many agencies, as well as Opposition parties in this Chamber and the Seanad, where our housing spokesperson is Senator Rebecca Moynihan, dealing with this issue. The Lord Mayor of Dublin presented a homeless strategy to the Minister recently with a wish list of issues she and the city council feel need to be addressed, including the ban on evictions. I trust the Minister will take that document from the Lord Mayor in good faith. The Minister knows from a Dublin perspective about the issue of a number of generations living in one home. That happens elsewhere in the country as well. The impact on children's education was mentioned earlier and these children are trying to break out of that cycle and fulfil their potential. I often sound like a broken record when I speak of this following statistic. The difference between the oral language capacity of a three-year-old child from a welfare dependent or disadvantaged family and a three-year-old in a more comfortable setting can be as much as two-thirds. One three-year-old will have 400 words and the other will have 1,200. That is compounded by housing issues because as these children enter school, their ability to read, to have space to do any homework, and the capacity of parents to spend time and to read with them is curtailed because of the cramped housing conditions. How can we improve on that statistic and afford children the opportunity to reach their potential? The Minister knows this to be a problem so I am aware that I am preaching to the converted. A little over a year ago, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and Focus Ireland launched a document on homelessness in the classroom. They never thought they would be in a position where they needed to produce a document like that to help teachers deal with the issue of homelessness in their classrooms. We are dealing with a profound ill and if this Bill can turn our eyes to the causes of homelessness in order to root them out and place a statutory obligation on all agencies, including local authorities, to have a homelessness prevention plan or take preventative measures, that will be a positive step. On that basis, I am glad the Minister is not opposing the Bill, notwithstanding the issues he has pointed out within in. This matter is not going away. I spoke of the sentiments of Tom Johnson. When one thinks of childhood and the chances children have, they only get one shot at it and it should not be a failure of ours that curtails their chance to fulfil their potential.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«When I came back into the Dáil and took on the responsibility of speaking on housing matters for our spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, I felt like I was walking into a dressing room where everybody knew each other for years and I just had to get to know the dynamics. I have other responsibilities in this Oireachtas in terms of education, enterprise and trade but I am taken aback because, as Deputy Ó Broin said, tomorrow we break up for Christmas and we have to deal with this extensive piece of legislation which is so crucial to so many lives. As the Minister is aware, we had a debate only last night on the causes of homelessness. It appears to me from speaking to Senator Moynihan that two Bills have been wedged together: a residential tenancies Bill has been wedged into a planning and development Bill in order to deal with two issues at the one time. The Minister has decided not to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny. Without that, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, that our ability to provide the type of scrutiny that is needed for these far-reaching measures that are incredibly important to the daily lives of citizens has been curtailed. I can hear the Minister's voice as an Opposition spokesperson in previous years.If he was still the Opposition spokesperson for his party and a Minister walked in and tried to do this the week before Christmas, I am quite sure the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would say the very same thing - that it is too much in too short a time. The people who need this Bill are so vulnerable that we must do this right. We have put down amendments in good faith around a sunset clause etc. and the onerous process. Is it the intention of the Minister or the knee-jerk intention of departmental officials for this to be overly onerous on the tenant at all times? We will speak to this on various different amendments as we go through the evening. The Minister has done many things since taking office that we have been quite pleased with. He has engaged with my party in a constructive way with the rent-to-buy scheme that I have raised with the Minister and we hope to get some progress on that. He took that on board as something he could work with. We applauded the Minister's move on co-living arrangements, and I made a statement on that a number of weeks ago. Last night he made a contribution in not opposing the Bill from the Opposition; that was also constructive. Many of the initiatives he has taken appear to be getting somewhere, and all of us want that. This is crucial for the people who sent us here. It really feels that at this hour and this date, we are not doing the matter justice with the manner in which it is being presented to us. We have our amendments and we will try to work with the Minister on them and improve the Bill as we go through it. In saying that, I must contend that the manner in which this is being done is less than satisfactory.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not intend to use all my allotted time as there are many amendments we wish to discuss on Committee Stage. As Deputy Ó Broin stated, this is not really the way we should be doing business. The Labour Party has no issue with the motion as proposed, but to present the House with the emergency-type rationale the Minister has given for the Bill is not good enough. I commented previously that it seems to be two Bills wedged into one. As a legislative body and a Parliament, we must be equipped with the time to scrutinise Bills in a proper fashion. When a Minister comes to the House and apologises for the lack of time but explains that there is an emergency nature to the legislation, the Government did not realise how important it was, and then expects Deputies to screech in here and the Bill to be passed immediately, it leads Members to believe that we are not giving the Bill the scrutiny and deference it deserves. Any Bill that comes before the Oireachtas needs to undergo such a level of scrutiny. On that basis, I do not intend to make a long-winded contribution. The Labour Party accepts the rationale behind the motion, but to deal with such complex matters on the second-last sitting day before the Christmas break leaves a lot to be desired. These issues have such significant implications for people who are in housing need, as well as for the democratic process of the development plan. I repeat that if the Minister were a member of the Opposition, he would be saying the exact same thing I am saying.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have gone from J.P. McManus to Karl Marx in a single leap. While I support the other amendments, I want to speak to amendment No. 7 because we want to ensure this is not a long-lasting provision within the Act. To make reference to what has been said already, the development plan is effectively the constitution of the city or county in which one lives. There is often an underappreciation on the part of the citizens of that city or county of how significant it is. The Minister will know that one of the few functions of real power a councillor has is to rezone land. The development plan is the overarching plan for a city, within which it is very difficult to get a planning application, or it is what planners in each individual county or city will refer to when granting planning permission. I did not intend to make a political point but I will make one anyway. If we go back through the history of the State to when there were tribunals of inquiry into the grubby dealings of backhanders and brown envelopes and all the rest of it, at the heart of that whole dynamic was the development plan of the city or county in question. My party was never involved in such dealings but that was what broke an awful lot of people's confidence in the political system because councillors were taking bribes to vote in a particular way in order to rezone land. I know the Minister agrees with me on my next point. The Act relating to strategic housing developments has taken much of this planning out of the councils' remit. Any development of more than 100 units goes straight to An Bord Pleanála and it does not have to adhere as strictly to the development plan. The Minister and others mentioned judicial reviews. Often the only recourse communities have is to go to the High Court to seek a judicial review, if they have the money. Not every community has the money or the means to go to the High Court and seek a judicial review on the basis of a decision made by An Bord Pleanála, unless it has a very high chance of success. The repercussions for a community or someone's own pocket are huge if that review does not go well. I have been involved in two such reviews and both of them were relatively successful. My point is about the sanctity of the development plan. All citizens must understand how incredibly important it is. It is also about that essential democratic link which so often happens at council level. The Minister knows this as he has served on a county council himself. So many powers are vested in the executives. The executives have so much power and councillors often complain about the lack of powers they have. There is an essential democratic connection between individual citizens and the councillors they elected to craft this development plan and to stand over it. That is the context in which planning permissions are given because it was the councillors elected by the people who formulated the plan and they are the only ones who get to rezone or sell land. That consultation, knowledge and power, and the empowerment of the public to know that, is absolutely essential. We cannot demand of any council official, council employee or council worker to put his or her health or life at risk during a pandemic in order to do what has always been done. We accept that. However, there must be an understanding within the Act that this is an emergency measure that will come to an end and that the Minister will do that by order. There must be a given date after which this practice of Zoom meetings and so on will no longer be expected. We have to absolutely accept the essential connectivity of democratically elected councillors and the sacred trust they have from the people in crafting something that is based on that trust and not on an envelope of money they may have gotten in a pub. That has happened in the past and powers have been stripped from councillors and elected officials because of that practice but this is an essential function of theirs. The importance of the development plan and its process has to be something every single citizen understands inasmuch as they possibly can. I acknowledge that the Minister is against the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 and wants to see the back of it. When legislation like that, which overrides the development plan, comes in we have to try to explain to elected councillors at public meetings that because a development has over 100 units it does not go to the council or the planners who know the dynamics of the area and who have to adhere to the development plan. It goes to An Bord Pleanála, which is an independent planning board and the only recourse people have if they want to do something about it is to take a High Court case. We all represent areas with planners and legal people living in them who do these things and have this expertise. If someone lives in an area of disadvantage, a developer can come in and override the process by sticking in a planning application for over 100 units, which goes straight to An Bord Pleanála. If An Bord Pleanála gives permission, the only recourse the community has is to go to the High Court. It must have the money to do that and that is the democratic deficit within this. One needs the money to go the High Court and if people do not have it they are not going to get anywhere. That has always been my major objection to the Act relating to strategic housing developments, because it meant communities were locked out of their say and their proper representation at the planning stage. Without elongating my speech as others have, and without getting down and dirty on the rights or otherwise of tax exiles, who we would rather just paid their taxes and helped us all get through this pandemic rather than picking and choosing their own pet projects in the places they are from-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----it is important that we get back to the reason we are here, which is to defend democracy and defend that essential link between individual citizens and the people they elect to oversee the development plans of a city and a county.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 7:In page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“(2) The amendment effected by subsection (1) shall continue in operation until the date specified by order under section 251A(4) of the Principal Act.”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will be aware that the announcement of any job losses in any part of the country is particularly devastating at this time of year. He will be aware that last Friday, the potential loss of 440 jobs at the Viatris plant in Baldoyle was announced. This was a devastating blow to the workers and their families at this time of year. The company is going to engage in the process over the next two years. I feel strongly that the Department, the Minister of State and the Tánaiste can play a positive role in reassuring the workers that their statutory entitlements will be forthcoming and that the Government will work with the company to ensure fair play and to offer new employment opportunities to those greatly affected by the announcement. An announcement like this is no different from any other job loss announcement anywhere else in the country and it should be treated by the Government and Department in the exact same way. Four hundred and forty jobs involve 440 people and 440 families. I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me that the announcement could not have been made at a worse time, as we approach Christmas. I have written to the Tánaiste to seek a meeting with him. I have also written to the company itself. There is an opportunity for us to step into this space and provide solutions, leadership and comfort to those affected. I am unsure whether the workers have a representative body or trade union representation. I have yet to find that out. If there is, we obviously want to engage with the trade union. If not, it is all the more important for political representatives to do what they absolutely can for the workers affected. The Minister of State will agree with pretty much everything I am saying but I want to ensure that we start a process to help the workers over the next two years, maximise the potential of the site so the area will not lose out in the long term owing to the announcement, and ensure this is just a fork in the road for the 440 workers and their families, rather than a devastating blow from which they may never recover. With that, I would appreciate the Minister of State's response.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would appreciate a copy of the response, if that is possible. I appreciate the Minister of State's reply. I do not in any way think that this situation is a reflection on his Department or the Government. It is particularly bad form for the company not to have communicated this decision to IDA Ireland or the Department before making it. Of course, the timing is also bad form. On that basis, we have got off to a bad start to our relationship with the entity in question. I appeal again to the Minister of State that this is something on which we can work together. Perhaps when we reconvene in the new year, seeing that this is going to be a two-year process, all local elected representatives can meet with the Minister of State and the Tánaiste to build up a continuum of a relationship over a period of time to ensure that we can do our best for these families and to lay down a template. If this happens again, we want to be sure that we have a template in place to which we can refer. The Minister of State mentioned retraining and education, and I appreciate that. I would hope that the Minister of State takes my call to work together in good faith. Perhaps in the new year, we can set up a meeting between all the local Deputies, officials from the Department and officials from the Department of Social Protection who will be heavily engaged in this matter. That would ensure that everything is being done, any communications that we are getting from the workers or their families can also be relayed to the Minister of State's Department, anything that may have been missed, and also to ensure that, in the fullness of time, this is seen to be a fork in the road and not a full stop for any family. I appreciate the engagement of the Minister of State and hope it will continue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I speak for many people when I say that the point-scoring between Sinn Féin and Fine Gael is getting quite tedious. I have a question about the Beacon Hospital. It is reported in the Irish Independent today that the staff in the privately-owned Beacon Hospital were vaccinated yesterday. This is the same hospital that refused to sign up to the deal with the HSE to make even 30% of its beds available to the public health system. Dr. Jack Lambert said the following this morning:Mater has vaccinated less than 50% of those who need it because we have not been given enough vaccine; who made those decisions? No transparency in who made these decisions. Poor communication. COVID vaccine roll out is critical; we need transparency, a very detailed plan.Why are the vaccinations happening in a private hospital that will not row in behind the national effort, meagre and all as it is? Why are people in the Mater hospital not getting the vaccine, as outlined by Dr. Lambert?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party has tried to be as reasonable and as constructive as possible in these most trying of times, particularly in the education space. We know there is no easy decision for the Minister to make. We appreciate that she was faced with a difficult scenario last week. We appreciate the efforts she has made to listen to education spokespersons who spoke to her on Monday with concerns we all have about a cohort of students who will be severely and profoundly affected by school closures. We appreciated that she gave us an opportunity to share our views with her, otherwise the only opportunity to speak to her would have been today. The Minister made an effort to open schools for those with additional needs and for those sitting the leaving certificate. For particular reasons this did not work out and she reversed that decision, which I felt was the right thing to do because there was no way we could open schools until the schools were ready to open. A number of things have happened, however, over the past days that have made it really difficult for the likes of myself to maintain that goodwill. The Minister's letter, sent to each school in the State to be passed on to students, was ill-advised. It has been described to me as "political" and "divisive". The Minister's Cabinet colleagues decided to descend on the media over the weekend to try to make liars out of the trade unions regarding consultation. While it is welcome that today there seems to be a move toward the reopening of schools and special schools for those with additional needs, it is unfortunate that the announcement was released within minutes of us having this debate. It would have been better for us to have a little bit more detail. If the Minister is earnest about her wish to engage with Opposition spokespeople, it would have been worthy of her to have a discussion with us so that we could show leadership to make these difficult decisions happen. On additional needs, is she advocating for those staff, teachers and SNAs who work with young people who have additional needs, to be prioritised for the next round of vaccination? I will turn to the leaving certificate. The Minister is quite right that there is a huge amount of stress and anxiety among the student body. The Labour Party was the only party not to call for the cancellation of last year's examination because we were unconvinced that a replacement system would be fair. We have more time now, however, and a lot of the issues that were rolled out last year were reversed by the Minister, and we are supportive of this, especially the school profiling element. We would suggest to her that an early decision on this is necessary, which we suggest should be February. Notwithstanding what she is saying, and what various voices are saying, the level of uncertainty is intolerable for junior certificate or sixth year students having lost 11 weeks of tuition in the past academic year, and for the month of January this year. If we are honest with ourselves, the Minister knows that it is much easier to close schools than it is to reopen them. With the numbers circulating around and the death count rising, it is unlikely schools will reopen before the mid-term break or St. Patrick's Day or beyond. We all mention disadvantage. In my submission to her I raised the issue of 16 year old students who have no legal requirement to be in school and the fact that they may be lost to the system, and many have been lost to the system. We need to begin talking about post-Covid education in Ireland and what that vision will be. Are preparations being made to repair the profound damage being done by school closures, which are not the Minister's fault or the Government's fault notwithstanding the fact they did not take NPHET advice in December? Can we speak to or focus on young people in disadvantaged backgrounds, in poverty, and with additional needs? Can we have an investment or a post-Covid vision of radical investment in individual tuition, reduced class sizes, resources for schools or for individuals in mainstream schools who are profoundly disadvantaged, who have been damaged and who will be damaged by the continuing school closure? I will reiterate my three points for the Minister. On the announcement made today on additional educational needs, the detail of which I have not read, I hope it will be worked out and successful. I am sincere in that but I want her to speak to vaccinations. On the leaving certificate, will she make her intention absolutely clear in February? It is very hard to find the Government convincing that the junior and leaving certificate examinations will continue as she has said. My third point was on disadvantage. Can we have a conversation about a radical package to redress the damage that has been done by school closures, and that when the schools are reopened we do not pretend this damage does not exist?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Nobody in the House denies the Minister has a difficult job. I particularly notice accusations from the Opposition and his own Government Members that are not truthful and that could be extremely frustrating for the Minister. I heard a Member from the Opposition state we are at the bottom of the European table when it comes to vaccination, which is not true, and a Member from the Government - the Minister's own party - stated that vaccinations are only happening from Monday to Friday, and again that is not true. I know that in the Minister's position, he must battle through many political accusations and misinformation. However, I know if the Minister were standing where I am now, he would make the exact speech I am about to make. I know if he were still in his role as part of the Opposition, he would not find any way to justify the treatment of student nurses and midwives. I know he would rail against it. I know he would connect the new pay deal for the Secretary General at the Department of Health with this matter. I know he would probably pick up the speech the Minister would have just made and dismiss it out of hand as being tone deaf to the reality of the work being done by those who are putting their health and lives at risk. The Minister does not need to be reminded of this but I will do so anyway. Yesterday, 93 people were recorded as having died from this virus.The youngest was 41 years of age, and yet student nurses and midwives are working in this scenario for poverty pay. My Labour Party colleague, Senator Hoey, has published a Bill, the intent of which is to link the pay of student nurses and midwives to the rate paid to healthcare assistants in recognition of the increased workload and risk. The INMO has also called for healthcare assistant contracts for all students whose placements were suspended and clarity on what will happen to placements over the coming months. The Minister mentioned his own review, but as the INMO has stated, it is quite clear that this review is out of date and is not going to cut it. It is not good enough. The Minister would not accept it if he was in my position, and the student nurses and midwives should not accept it either. They need to be paid at the healthcare assistant rate to reflect the higher levels of risk in the health service, as proposed in the Labour Party Bill. There are other outstanding issues that need to be addressed, including the fact that nurses are being asked to pay for the privilege of renewing their membership of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, for 2021. I put it to the Minister quite baldly that we are all being told that we are in this together, that all of the old received wisdom and legacies are being challenged, and that there is nothing that will not be done to address the situation, but that patently is not true. I wish that student nurses and midwives had the same power as other lobby groups who seem to be able to influence Government policy. I wish they had the same power as the hospitality industry and that they had the ability to change completely the methodology and mechanisms being used by the Government to address this problem. I wish the Minister had bent the advice he got from within his Department to facilitate student nurses as he did to facilitate hospitality and home visits simultaneously in December. I wish that student nurses and midwives had the same power as the private hospital sector, which seems to be a sacred cow in this country and one that must be pussyfooted around. Robust engagement with that sector seems to be impossible for some reason. Apparently people like me, standing where I stand, just do not understand the complexity of the situation, how delicate and difficult it is or the fact that it is not at all simple. However, when it comes to student nurses and midwives, the Department conducts a review, which is already out of date, and recommends a payment of €100 which it believes will suffice. At the same time the Department believes that the new Secretary General of the Department of Health is fully worth an extra €81,000. None of this adds up. The problem here, as far as the Irish public is concerned, is that there is a deep unfairness at the heart of all of this. When it comes down to it, for those on the front line who are putting their own health and lives at risk as well as the health and lives of their families, there is a barrier or a line which the Government will not cross, unless it involves rounds of applause. I know that the Minister for Health would be saying the very same thing if he was standing where I am standing now. I have some advice for him from his friends and colleagues in the Labour Party. I suggest that he thinks of the speech he would make if he was still an Opposition health spokesperson.I suggest that he realise the depth of feeling regarding this issue within hospitals and healthcare settings and among student nurses themselves. I ask him to reflect on how embittered people are and on the length of time for which this issue will affect their mindsets as they look forward to a career in this area. I also ask him to reflect on the amount of money this would actually cost in the overall scheme of things. I ask him to reflect on how he can justify the pay increase of €81,000 for the Secretary General of the Department of Health and on the reasons he has given for this increase, which include that the job is difficult, high-powered and responsible. Reflecting on that, he might consider how those superlatives and adjectives might apply to the role of the student nurses and midwives who are asking to be paid and how they will have to register this year and pay for that privilege. I ask him to reflect on all these matters. I know, as the Minister knows, that these things are not simple and that it would take some manoeuvring and action on his part but, if anything has been proven over the course of this pandemic it is that if Government really wants to do something it can do it. What I learned from my time in government is that, when a group is important and strong enough and when the political will is strong enough, anything can be achieved. The problem is that the will is just not there. Perhaps this is because departmental officials are advising the Minister that this may set an unwanted precedent and that it may open a Pandora's box that it would not be possible to close but, in the fullness of time when this pandemic is over, this will be a black mark on the Minister's own record and that of the Government. It will be felt that when it came down to it these people were just not worth more than €100. If the Minister was standing where I am, he would be saying the exact same thing. The Labour Party supports this motion. We have not just been drafting motions, but have published legislation. We want these payments to be given so that these people can have the dignity they deserve and we want the Minister to live up to the rhetoric he used in opposition now that he is in his current position. I ask him not to stand behind speeches which he would have decried if he were standing where I am.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join the Taoiseach and others in expressing the Labour Party's sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives yesterday, one of whom was 41 years of age, which should be a reminder to everybody in society that this is a virus that can affect all age groups. I also join the Taoiseach in congratulating, if I may say, one of our own in becoming President of the United States on his inauguration today. The Labour Party is attempting to de-escalate the tensions that have been involved in the special education issue. We do not feel at this point that it is going to benefit anybody to point the finger, to blame or to join the attempt to create division between special education teachers, SNAs and parents. However, I put it to the Taoiseach that it is now time for him to get involved because it is clear that the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, have lost control of the situation. We were quite supportive of the Minister and the Minister of State in investigating the possibility of reopening schools, as the Taoiseach rightly said, for certain cohorts. We believe that the closing of schools is a profoundly negative thing to happen to children and it profoundly negatively affects the most vulnerable children, including those with additional needs and those in areas of disadvantage as well. However, from the start of this year, 6 January, an announcement was made on school reopening with no consultation. The Taoiseach should please not make liars of trade union leaders who say that they were not consulted about the flat announcement on 6 January. On 14 January, another announcement was made, before an education debate in this House, on the reopening of special schools and special classes. Again, there was no agreement. On 15 January, at 8 o'clock on a Friday evening, a letter was sent to every school in the country on the reopening of special schools. Again, there was no agreement. Even since last night, we had an extremely ill-advised communication from the Department, with quotes from both Ministers, pointing fingers all over the place. Both unions issued a joint communication saying that they were still at the table and willing to talk. Comments from the Minister, Deputy Foley, this morning, suggested that comments made about one of the union leaders was disingenuous. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, made a comparison between this situation and the mother and baby homes, and last week she made a comment about non-SNA students being normal. We have been doing our best as a political entity to try to be constructive. In the spirit of being constructive, could I ask the Taoiseach if his office would get centrally involved in this situation? Does he appreciate the severity of the situation and how dangerous it is for young people to be out of school for this length of time? Does he recognise that the entire reopening of schools is now in jeopardy because of the bad faith that has been shown by Ministers in their public comments? Will the Taoiseach also comment, please, on the potential for the next round of vaccinations to be centred on this area because that would give some comfort to those who are expected to be involved in this process? I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are now part of the problem and the Taoiseach and his office can be part of the solution. It is important for the Taoiseach and his office now to step in.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Taoiseach's response but he underestimates the damage that has been done in public commentary by the Minister and Minister of State. The Taoiseach mentioned the webinar last Monday, but I am aware of a webinar that took place last night. While this process was falling apart, the Minister, Deputy Foley, took it upon herself to attend a Fianna Fáil-sponsored webinar at 7 o'clock last night. We had a press statement from her yesterday evening and media comments this morning from her and the Minister of State in the Department that have been deeply unhelpful. Other school reopenings are now at risk because of the bad faith exhibited and bridges being burned all over the place by the Minister and Minister of State. Their commentary is ill-tempered and must be de-escalated. It is now the responsibility of the Taoiseach and his office to step in because the Minister and Minister of State are not in control of the situation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We support that call. There is no need to elongate the debate on it. It is important that the Minister comes before the House to facilitate questions on this important matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On that, we are not suggesting that the new Secretary General of the Department of Health should be paid nothing. The Taoiseach, however, does expect student nurses and midwives to be paid nothing. On the matter of vaccinations, because this is an important issue, the Taoiseach is battling against misinformation, not just from the Internet but from within his own party on certain occasions, regarding the weekday-only roll-out of vaccinations, which is not true. Members of the Opposition have also suggested that our vaccination rate is the lowest in Europe, which is also not true. Unfortunately, however, misinformation is even coming from the HSE. I have received such information regarding a hospital in my constituency. These are understandable mistakes and teething problems, but we feel we need a dedicated Minister of State to be the point person in Government for the vaccination process. There is much goodwill around the country for what the Government is trying to achieve and we in the Labour Party certainly want to play our part. It would be beneficial, however, if we had a dedicated Minister of State in place with full responsibility for the vaccination process as we roll it out and we want the Taoiseach to consider it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We welcome this debate but every time the Minister or the Minister of State get an opportunity to speak about this issue, they only make things worse. I am inclined not to ask any questions because the answers will just make things worse. The Labour Party has been trying to de-escalate this issue over recent days, but it is clear that the Minister and her Minister of State have lost control of the situation. Some of the Minister's statements are making the situation irretrievable, so I think I need to set the record straight. The Minister decided to make an announcement on 6 January about the return to school with no consultation in the middle of the highest infection rate in the world. All of us in the Opposition encouraged her to seek options for the return to school of those with additional needs, those who were vulnerable and those who were disadvantaged. If she had made those efforts and they came to naught with the best of intentions, she would have had no criticism from us. She then made another announcement a week ago amid great fanfare and self-congratulation all over the place, with no agreement. Then a letter was sent to every school in the country, again with no agreement. Inevitably, it fell apart last Tuesday when the Minister was apparently at a Fianna Fáil webinar at 7 o'clock. Then we went into an overdrive of unbelievable media management by Government. Whatever chance there was of recovering the situation was blown out of the water. We had a particularly ill-advised, bad-tempered communication from the Department that evening. Meanwhile, the unions were saying they still wanted to be at the table. The Minister of State, who has form in this regard and can rarely be let out without punching down on some vulnerable group, be it Travellers or those with addiction issues, followed on from a crass statement last week by going on national radio and making a comparison with mother and baby homes. Even in the past 24 hours, another Minister of State said on national radio that he is getting tired listening to unions setting themselves up as health experts and said the same thing on local radio this morning. The Minister has the audacity to tell us the unions are not following public health advice when her Government did not do that in December. For all of us who are trying to be constructive and focus the issue back on where it is supposed to be, nobody in Government has helped this at all. They have made it worse and worse and worse. Every interview, statement, press release and speech in this House has made it worse. It is as if they have decided to pick a side. I am at the point now of urging the Ministers not to say anything else, to return to the negotiating table and realise why they are here in the first place and to focus on the fact that the enemy is not teachers or SNAs. The enemy is the virus. The virus is the reason young people with additional needs are not in school.If the Government were to focus on that, we might actually get somewhere. What it has attempted to do, however, in poorly chosen language, poorly chosen press releases, poorly chosen statements and appalling rhetoric in interviews, is to make it worse and worse. It is putting in jeopardy not only the possibility of children and young people with additional needs returning to school but the entire project of getting back to school because it has burned every bridge it has come across. I have no questions, a Cheann Comhairle, because I am worried the answers would make matters worse. My only suggestion to the Minister and the Minister of State, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, who has appeared on national and local radio in the past 24 hours, is to stop saying anything in public. Let them say what they have to say in private with those unions that have also committed to doing the same, and then we might have a roadmap for achieving what we all want to achieve, namely, education being delivered for those who need it most.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have no problem with the Minister adding something constructive-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Minister knows, we are in the middle of a housing crisis and a homelessness crisis. We have a social housing crisis, a rent affordability crisis and an unaffordable house price crisis. The cause of these crises is an outdated, right-wing, ideological approach to planning and development which has led to a chronic underinvestment in public housing for the past 20 years and a housing market that is fundamentally broken. I represent the constituency of Dublin Bay North, which the Minister knows well. The hardest part of my job - the hardest part of the job for any of us in this House - is the hundreds of representations I receive every year from people in desperate need of adequate housing. There are more than 29,000 people on waiting lists in the greater Dublin area. In Dublin Bay North, there are 8,320 people on the Dublin City Council area B housing waiting list. Between January and September 2020, there were 196 allocations in area B, including transfers. At that rate, it would take 42 years to clear the list. People are suffering from the constant stress and fear of rent hikes or evictions. Some are living in overcrowded accommodation, with several generations of a family living in one house. There are some in severe medical need. There are three practical things I would ask the Minister to do to address this social housing and greater housing need in Dublin Bay North. First, I ask him to work with my colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, and the cross-party working group in Dublin City Council, which is coming up with a new plan to deliver housing on the Oscar Traynor Road site. Second, I ask that the Department would pay for the community infrastructure required to support developments and that it separate those costs from the housing costs. The stand-off in this debate a few minutes ago calls to mind the attempts by Sinn Féin Deputies to pretend that they are hugely ideologically opposed to what the Government is doing. I would say to those who consistently vote down proposals for local property tax increases in the local authorities that this funding could go towards housing need, housing infrastructure and community infrastructure. It could go towards homeless services and sheltered housing. I do not see how anybody from Sinn Féin could side with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil in local authorities to vote an extra €375 into the hands of somebody who owns a €1 million property. Let us have less of the grandstanding and populism and more of a realisation that this sort of vote, whipped by Sinn Féin, cost Dublin City Council €12 million that could have been gratefully received and used for the types of projects we are discussing. Third, we need the Minister to finance Dublin City Council to allow it to accelerate its apartment regeneration projects across the city. This would improve not just the quality but the quantity of units. I know plans are advancing for Cromcastle Court in Kilmore and St. Anne's Court in Raheny, but there are many other opportunities. The current plan would take 15 years but, with a bit of ambition, there is no reason that we could not get it down to maybe half that.Given the low cost of capital and the exorbitant rates being paid for the housing assistance payment in areas of Dublin 17 in my constituency, investment in public housing in Dublin Bay North will actually save the public purse money over the long term. As well as the crisis in social housing, we have a crisis in homelessness, unaffordable rents and house prices all caused by a broken housing market. The Minister and I have spoken before about the potential for a rent-to-buy scheme. I know the Minister has shown interest in it and I believe it is one of the schemes we should recover and invest in again. The reason for the broken market is that we have a system and a Department, as far as I can see, that has been almost completely ideologically captured by the private sector mindset. No finer example of this can be found than in the strategic housing development, SHD, process. It is an anti-democratic process that has utterly failed to deliver units. Instead, it has had a less-than 30% success rate in five years. It has been publicly stated that the SHD legislation was delivered almost line by line by the Property Industry Ireland lobby group to the Department and the Minister's Fine Gael predecessor, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney. Now, we find ourselves with unaffordable half-empty high-rise buildings and unsustainable co-living applications that are entirely aimed at maximising the value of a single site instead of delivering sustainable and affordable housing across Dublin. The brutal truth has been highlighted in recent days by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland report, which shows that high-rise buildings are more expensive. This exposes the lie that height is a panacea to our problems. We have to stop allowing developers to use the housing crisis as an excuse to ride roughshod over all the principles of sustainable and affordable housing, including the principle of having a planning process with proper scrutiny of planning applications and a development plan voted in by elected councillors who understand the dynamic of the local authority area. There are big questions that we need to address to do this, like the right to housing, implementation of the Kenny report and proper taxation of speculative development land. I call on the Minister to break the influence of the developers and hedge funds on the Department and to get rid of SHDs. The Minister has committed to doing this, in fairness to him. We need to reinstate the eviction ban, implement a proper rent freeze and ensure that the same groups which caused the last crash are not allowed to exploit this housing crisis for their own ends. I appreciate I have not given the Minister much time for a response but if he wishes to correspond with me I would appreciate it, especially about the constructive suggestions that myself and my colleague, Senator Moynihan, have given to the Minister and the Department recently.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the Minister succeeds in his endeavour to drive down the virus and rid this land of Covid-19, we will all succeed and we can all go back to the type of human relationships and interactions all of us have been sorely missing. It is now February. In January, we lost more than 1,000 people to this virus. We had more infections in January than we had in 2020 so clearly a new strategy is needed. Unfortunately, I do not get from the Minister's contribution that he understands the sense of the need for a new strategy. Over the weekend, the Taoiseach acknowledged that mistakes had been made in December. It is fair to acknowledge also that mistakes were made across this Chamber in December in terms of what people were calling for and what the Government did. If politicians learn from those situations, that is good for politics. I can understand that the Minister gets frustrated when people in his party are peddling misinformation about Monday-to-Friday-only vaccinations. I would say that is deeply frustrating. I would say it is also frustrating when we hear people from the Opposition suggesting that we are at the bottom of the EU table in terms of vaccinations, which is also untrue. I appreciate that the Minister is working within a level of misinformation. However, there are things within the Government's control that are making matters much worse. What happened yesterday was a classic example of that. We had a leak, again, from the Department of Education about the potential reopening of schools. I am sure this information will have been of interest to teachers, special needs assistants and parents who will be dying to know more about the potential reopening. It is literally days since 1,000 deaths were announced. We had more infections in January than we in the entirety of 2020. That was another leak from the Department of Education, the same Department that cannot seem to get anything over the line without making an announcement about it or leaking about it, which again makes the reopening of schools more difficult.Then the Minister for beer gardens comes out and furthers his personal agenda, again making things worse by talking about potentially reopening industry and having family gatherings. This in no way recognises the fact that we are in the teeth of a body count. The Government's legislation on travel next week will apparently reference two countries. This is its great move after nine months of recommendations and calls from across this House. The UK is introducing legislation that deals with 33 countries, so why are we not going to where the UK is now? Why are we always behind? Why do we not become a European leader when it comes to suppressing the virus? There is genuinely no point in giving people hope about beer gardens, family gatherings and schools reopening if we are just going to go back and lock down again in May. People are going around the twist and finding it extremely difficult to function. We cannot give with one hand and take away with the other. Unless we are serious about driving down this virus as far as it can go, we will just get into a yo-yo effect of reopening, then closing and doing it again and again. Then we will see new variants requiring a whole new strategy. This is not working and it has not worked so that strategy must be stopped. The elements in the control of the Government must be controlled. There must be no more leaks from Departments or self-indulgent press conferences from the Tánaiste, who is clearly not in line with the national effort and is again making the work we are trying to share in this House more difficult.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This Bill, as presented to the House, is very much a double-edged sword. Significant aspects of the Bill are to be commended, but other elements act as red flags and present a considerable challenge to us in the Labour Party as to whether we ultimately feel that this Bill will be fit for purpose. I hope the Government will take the opportunity to listen to our constructive criticism of the Bill, as well as accepting our support for aspects of it, and will use this debate as an opportunity to consider how best we can collectively amend the Bill so that we can legislate for an LDA which will do what the people of Ireland need it to do. Let us remind ourselves of why we are here and what problem this Bill is intended to solve. We are in the middle of a crisis involving housing, homelessness, social housing, rental affordability and unaffordable house prices, as the Minister knows. Will this Bill help us to solve these problems? Will this Bill help us to solve the housing crisis and to keep it solved? We can break down that question into two main parts. The first concerns whether we need an LDA. The second part of the question then, if we agree that an LDA is needed, is if this Bill will deliver the LDA we need. The answer to the first part of the question is "Yes"; we need an LDA. The concept of an LDA is a good one. The former Deputy, Jan O'Sullivan, proposed a development bank to develop public housing on public land. This structure subsequently became known as a land development agency and is Labour Party policy. There is a large amount of public land, and a properly constituted LDA could help the State to utilise that land to provide an increased supply of public housing and create a mechanism for proactive management of the State's land to help to solve the housing crisis and deliver more social and affordable housing. The next question is whether this Bill gives us an LDA which will clear the social housing lists, lower private rents and increase the supply of houses that people can afford to buy.The answer to that question, with the Bill as it currently stands, is maybe. In truth the effectiveness of the Bill will be entirely dependent upon the policy of the Minister of the day and his or her Department, whoever that may be. And therein lies the reason for concern. We have serious concerns that there is a real danger under this Bill that the LDA could end up as a mechanism for the wholesale privatisation of large tranches of public land with a subsequent windfall profit for private agents while delivering only a bare minimum of 10% public housing and only 40% of moderately discounted housing labelled “affordable”, with the remainder sold at a price the market will bear. An example of this concern in the Bill is at section 73, which seems to guarantee that 50% of the housing will be affordable, but actually provides no such guarantee because section 75 states that the Minister may set a percentage of housing higher or lower than that set out in section 73 and can also set different percentages for different geographical or administrative areas. Essentially, the seeming protections in the Bill of the 50% affordable housing aspect provide no such protection. The second area of concern is the concept of market value of the land and the subsequent price paid for the housing built on it. The Bill mentions the concept of market value but the CEO of the LDA, Mr. John Coleman, has told the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that “the land will transfer at a value, taking account of the affordability requirement. Effectively, the value will be reduced to facilitate the delivery of affordable accommodation on the land.” So, we have a mechanism where land can be acquired at anything down to zero cost, depending on the project. Section 53 of the Bill provides that where there is a dispute, “The Minister shall prescribe the manner in which the market value of relevant public land shall be determined". Another concern is in section 76 which states that any housing prescribed under section 73 must be below the prevailing market price or market rent, but it makes no prescription as to how far below the market price or rent the housing will be.  In section 55 we have a provision for disposal of land by the agency, again with ministerial consent, where it "is no longer required by it for those purposes or the performance of those functions." Presumably this is when the houses are built or no more houses will be built. It is presumed that the agency will make disposals to the private sector including but not limited to private individuals and commercial entities as well as to local authorities, approved housing bodies and other public bodies. What we have here is a series of provisions that allow the agency to acquire land at prices to be effectively determined by the Minister, to deliver a level of social and affordable housing determined by the Minister, and then to dispose of much of this housing to private entities, again at prices approved by the Minister. This is an extraordinary level of power. It is a power to deliver housing for the public good, but also the power to deliver a considerable transfer of value from public to private ownership in deals that will have no remedy until after the fact. Effectively, the LDA is there to create deals that deliver housing. In discussing the Bill, we need to ask ourselves what level of scrutiny there is on these deals? When we look at it, beyond the Minister, there is a serious lack of democratic accountability. We find that far from adding control or checkpoints to the process the Bill explicitly removes the role of local authorities in scrutinising any of these deals regarding land acquired from the councils. This removes a level of public scrutiny at a crucial stage in any project on local authority land. At no point in the process does anyone outside the agency, the Minister and the Department get to scrutinise these deals end to end to ensure a sense check on whether we are delivering value for the people from public land banks. These are land banks that were explicitly protected by the Labour Party from the planned privatisation by Fine Gael after the 2011 election. This deficit of scrutiny brings us to the nub of the matter. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are two parties with a long history of delivering for the private sector. In Fianna Fáil in particular we have a party whose toxic relationship with private interests in this sector crashed the economy, collapsed the housing industry and destroyed capacity to build houses, resulting in the current drastic undersupply. Part of the function of a land development agency is to try to break the boom and bust cycle by providing a steady predictable stream of projects on land it has acquired and a steady stream of public housing to act as an anchor against future housing bubbles. In an ideal world one would not need to involve the private sector in the delivery of these houses. In the short to medium term, however, some level of private sector involvement is inevitable. The local authorities have been at the receiving end of a lot of the blame for the failure of the State to build adequate public housing. The truth is that the local authorities have long since been removed from any real decision-making power or capacity over public housing and we have a Department that has been institutionally reluctant to support any large direct local authority building on public land. Fine Gael took strategic housing development legislation, apparently almost verbatim, from the vested interests. The Minister will excuse me if I suggest that such a massive change in the way we manage public land, and particularly local authority land, will require a great deal more democratic scrutiny than is currently provided for in this Bill. I ask the Minister to fix loopholes in this Bill. As it stands, there is a serious concern that these loopholes could facilitate a wholesale rip-off of the public sector by private interests at the whim of any Minister who has been captured by private housing interests. I am seriously concerned about the absence of approval by democratically elected bodies such as the Dáil or local authorities. This need not be the case. As the work progresses it will be inevitable that a few standard templates will emerge. While the first few deals may attract considerable attention, as time goes on a level of standardisation will hopefully emerge and analysis of the success and failure of previous projects will allow for a relatively easy and public process of evaluation. We have discussed how the Bill provides for the acquisition, development and disposal of public land, but just as important for the long-term success of the agency will be the acquisition of additional private land. The LDA will have the power to acquire private land at scale again at market value. With a bit of imagination the Bill could provide an opportunity to deliver on the recommendations of the Kenny report to allow land to be acquired at a current use value rather than at inflated speculative prices. In order to be truly successful, the LDA will need to be able to acquire land to be developed at reasonable costs and for us no longer to be dependent upon the whims of private entities. This is a missed opportunity to provide a mechanism to make redundant the tactics of speculative acquisition, hoarding and flipping of sites by companies who make planning applications but never build houses and whose only objective is to create an artificial shortage of suitable sites that they can exploit through inflated sale prices. This is the very issue that caused the last housing bubble and crash and if we are not careful it will also cause the next. We are in favour of a land development agency with significant power to acquire public and private land with the express intention of working in partnership with local authorities to deliver public housing on public land. We want a far tighter definition of what success looks like and a far tighter scrutiny of the value delivered on an ongoing basis, and we need far tighter democratic protection from the exploitation of the agency for the private sector at the instigation of the Minister. Ultimately the success of the Bill will depend on whether we get enough social houses built to start clearing our housing lists and will depend on whether we get rents down to levels that mean we no longer waste billions of euro on short-term private rental at exorbitant rates. The success of the Bill will depend on whether the houses built are not just technically “affordable houses” or technically “cost rental” houses but are houses people can actually afford to buy or rent, and that we do it without pouring public cash without scrutiny into the bank balances of private entities. The best way to prevent the housing scandal of the future is to legislate now for the proper scrutiny of the key decisions that are made by the LDA as they are being made.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are several matters I wish to raise. I hope the Tánaiste will have time to respond to my contribution either orally or in writing. The first matter is the closure of Ulster Bank and the protection of redundancy rights for workers with respect to the pandemic unemployment payment, the EU directive on the minimum wage and, finally, casual trading by-laws. The Tánaiste knows this move will substantially reduce competition in the Irish mortgage and small and medium enterprise lending markets, which come under his remit and not just that of the Minister for Finance. Currently the average interest rate for new mortgages in Ireland is more than double the EU average and the average interest rate on SME lending and consumer loans in Ireland is also considerably higher than the EU average. Customers with mortgages and business loans will be very concerned that their loans may be flogged to vulture funds. As has also been mentioned, there are 2,800 workers who will also be concerned about their future. Will the Tánaiste set out what he feels he can do to save these 2,800 jobs as this comes under his remit? Will the State use its majority shareholding in PTSB to create a real third force in Irish banking that would benefit customers and small and medium enterprises? Will the Tánaiste confirm the transfer of undertakings for protection of employment will apply in any possible sale or acquisition of any part of Ulster Bank to an Irish bank where the Minister for Finance is a significant shareholder? There have been serious concerns raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, that time on the PUP does not count towards redundancy rights. The Department has stated that the matter is legally complex and it is seeking advice on it. This seemed to be clear enough when the legislation was introduced last March. The response of the Minister for Finance at the time was:On the questions put to me by Deputies Nash and Brady, the existing provisions in Schedule 3 to the Redundancies Payment Act 1967 already provide that periods of temporary lay-offs do not break continuity of employment. This will obviously include temporary lay-off periods due to the effects of the measures required by an employer to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid 19. I hope that answers the questions That was from the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Finance. Based on those assurances in the Dáil by the Minister for Finance and multiple assurances from officials, a Labour Party amendment at the time was not pressed. Unfortunately, the rights of workers are being put at risk by the failure of the Government to carry through on promises that were issued. The Government got co-operation on the emergency legislation because of that promise. Will the Tánaiste ensure his Department is operating under the interpretation of the law as explained by the Minister for Finance last March?If there is a difficulty, I ask the Minister to advise the House that he intends to fix it, and to do so in a way so as not to disenfranchise the redundancy rights of workers during this pandemic. On the issue of the minimum wage directive, does the Minister regret his decision to co-sign a letter attempting to undermine the proposed European minimum wage directive? Does he accept that he was part of an effort to block the effective implementation of the directive? Does he accept that Ireland had pre-Covid rates of 23% of the population on low pay, as defined by the OECD, and that 40% of young workers were in insecure work? Does he accept that with less than 30% of the working population covered by collective bargaining, we are far below the 70% coverage deemed normal and desirable in the European context? I ask the Minister whether he or his Department has taken any further action in respect of the proposed minimum wage directive, what future plans exist regarding Ireland's response to this directive, and what plans he has to reduce the dependence of our economy on low pay. I appreciate that I am eating up most of the time allotted, so a written response would be appreciated to this, my last question. Is the Minister aware of the difficulties faced by small businesses, particularly restaurants and cafés, looking to expand into food trucks and mobile businesses? Has he had any conversations with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the causal trading by-laws, which in many cases do not allow sufficient flexibility for councils to rapidly create new locations for such services? I have drafted a Bill at the request of a cross-party group of councillors in the Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle area, including Councillors Brian McDonagh and Eoghan O'Brien, which I will be happy to make available to the Minister. With time, other emergency legislation and the co-operation of the Government, it could be delivered quickly. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have concerns that the Department feels we need to return to normal, when the issue in Irish education is that normal is the problem. At yesterday's meeting of the education committee, we touched on the analysis that, according to the Minister, her Department has carried out on the damage caused by the lack of in-class teaching, particularly for children in acute disadvantage, who need school the most. I emphasise "in-class" because teachers have been teaching and school workers have been working throughout this period.There does not seem to be the same urgency or vision within the Irish education system. It is as if we just want children to go back and that will be normal. However, we need to acknowledge that not being in class since Christmas for certain cohorts of disadvantaged children in particular will be profoundly damaging. How will we address that? Regarding special educational needs, I am delighted that the Minister of State is a convert to the concept of equality. This radical policy change from her is most welcome. I suggest to her a return to normal will be the problem. Many parents in my constituency, and I believe across the country, face this bizarre scenario that if they have a child with a particular diagnosis and they want to get a place for that child in a local school or beyond, they are handed a list of schools by the special educational needs organiser and told, "Best of luck." Again, a return to that scenario will not be good enough. I ask that teachers, SNAs and other school workers would be considered key workers for the purposes of vaccination. I ask the Minister to advocate on their behalf. It is not necessarily possible to encourage a full successful reopening of schools without acknowledging that teachers, SNAs and other school workers are indeed key workers. It is not good enough just to open schools; we must keep them open. I am glad the Minister has done a number of things on the leaving certificate. First, she has introduced choice. Second, she has listened to the student voice in all this. I congratulate the efforts of the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, in all this. Third, she waived the fee, as we asked her to do. However, we are all still awaiting the review of the leaving certificate of 2020. What is the status of that review? Just as with the idea of going back to normal when normal is the problem, the problem with the leaving certificate is the leaving certificate - not just the pandemic but the leaving certificate. It is not fit for purpose. It is out of date and needs to be radically overhauled. What process do we have in place to recognise that going back to normal with the leaving certificate will be the problem? We need a radical vision for repairing the damage and a catch-up fund which could include, as has already been articulated, the need to reduce class sizes. I acknowledge that the Minister was true to her word in passing on the pupil-teacher ratio cut to all DEIS schools, for which she deserves credit. I ask the Minister to respond to the issues of the catch-up fund, the reality of families with children who have special educational needs, young people who are faced with an impossible situation trying to access school places for themselves, the leaving certificate and vaccinations.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My time is short, and I do appreciate my colleagues, Deputies Gannon and Tully, joining me in this debate. Nothing really brings shame to the Department of Education more than its treatment of special needs assistants, SNAs, who we send into the war against Covid in classrooms throughout the country without basic provision for their own safety and without any sense of when they will be vaccinated. It is quite clear that when it comes to actually paying them, however, the Department will do everything it can resist that temptation. What we are talking about here is proper accreditation for the certification which they receive. We are having difficulty in getting that accreditation. The suspicion is the Department does not want to sanction such accreditation because it would mean SNAs would have to be properly paid. On that basis, I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response. I am also interested to hear the contributions of my colleagues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State knows, I know and, indeed, the cat knows that teachers would not be treated as SNAs are being treated because the Department would not get away with it. It is clear that the Department has a long-standing issue or policy when it comes to dealing with SNAs in that they are not treated with the same level of respect as teachers. We have seen that throughout the pandemic, from announcements being made without the sign-off of the union representing SNAs to the absolute debacle of the redeployment process last year. Now we have a situation where the Minister of State has given a speech to the House that is very well-meaning but which shows that she will not do what we require her to do, namely, afford SNAs the credit and respect they deserve for the training they do. I suggest to the Minister of State that she should work harder to put in place the accreditation that SNAs are seeking for the training they do. This would show them that the Department recognises that theirs is a profession of which they can be proud, instead of leaving them always to feel that they are being undermined by the Department.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have a daughter. I worry about her because she is a girl and because she is Irish. She has been born into a country with a record of treating women with disdain. She was born in May 2018, when the country finally put to rest a constitutional article, the eighth amendment, that forced 4,000 women a year to travel to England like criminals and others to order abortion pills over the Internet. That was in 2018, a full 50 years after the UK had determined that reproductive healthcare was a basic right for women. She was born to a grandmother who was forced to leave her public service job as soon as she got married. She was born in the year of the 100th anniversary of the first time some Irish women were permitted to vote but to a country whose Parliament is still only 22% female, and too many of these Deputies are subjected to vile online abuse. I have a daughter. I worry she is a second-class citizen because Irish education still, too often, wants to separate her from boys. Some 17% of Irish primary school children are educated in single-gender schools. One third of our second level schools are gender-segregated. That is totally outside of the European norm, embedding gender stereotypes and restricting non-traditional subject choices, none of which has any basis in contemporary education research or best practice. In addition, 90% of all of these schools are under the patronage of a church that considers women to be second-class citizens. I have a daughter. I worry she is a plaything for commercial interests. I worry there are highly-paid executives sitting in boardrooms, plotting and planning how best to sexualise her at an early age so they can make money out of her. I worry that this pressure will pile on top of her before she has the tools to deal with it, through the music industry, through the fashion industry, through the make-up industry. I worry that society will demand of her to have a smartphone, and that opens her up to a world of danger. I worry about the corporate determination to make her focus on her sexual power before she can access and appreciate her societal power, her community power, her civic power, her democratic power and, yes, even her commercial power. I have a daughter. I worry she cannot see what she can be. What if she was to enter the business world? She lives in a country with a 14.4% gender pay gap, where female executive directors only account for 8.5% of the total and only one in nine CEOs are women. What if she chooses a career in academia? A 2018 Higher Education Authority report showed that while half of all lecturers in universities are female, these numbers fall dramatically at higher grades, such as associate professor, 32%, and professor, 23%. I have a daughter. What if she was to take an interest in sport? Despite the success of the 20x20 campaign, how can I explain to her that the Irish women's soccer players get paid one fifth of what the Irish men get paid - that Katie McCabe’s blood, sweat and tears are worth only 20% of Seamus Coleman’s? How can I explain to her that national broadcasters still, for the most part, do not believe a woman can give an expert opinion on major sporting fixtures or, at a local level, that men's teams will still always be prioritised. I have a daughter. Like all parents, I pray she will never be a victim of discrimination or hate, but I know life is tougher for female Travellers, female migrants, female prisoners, women with disabilities and women in recovery from addiction. I know that low-paid, vulnerable work is disproportionately carried out by women. I have a daughter. She may herself have all the worries I have some day. She may herself one day be pregnant. She may still have to be treated in one of the outrageously dilapidated maternity hospitals in this city. She will have to deal with the fact that basic medication for Irish women in pregnancy can cost twice what it costs in the UK, that she will get no work leave for a miscarriage or medical complication related to reproductive healthcare, that free availability of period products is something that has to be battled for through a barrier of red-faced, male-oriented officialdom and that the provision of childcare is a national scandal, a scandal that persists because it disproportionately affects women, and poorly paid because it is disproportionately staffed by women. I have a daughter. I want her to realise the power of girls around the world. I want her to know that a village can only change, a town can only change, a country can only change and the world can only change for the better when girls have access to education. The most powerful image in the world is a girl with a book. That image terrifies those who want things to stay the same. I have a daughter. I want her to be proud to be Irish. I want her to learn of the generations of Irish women who made this country better for girls just like her - Countess Markievicz, Máirín de Burca, Eileen Desmond, Mary Robinson and Ivana Bacik. I want her not to be defined by the failings of others but to stand on the shoulders of these giants, and to take her place as an equal in this country and an equal in this world. I have a daughter. I want her and girls like her not always to be thought of last. I want her to live in a country that has been designed for women and designed by women. I want her to redesign her own country for her, for us, for girls and boys that come after her, for my daughter and for all daughters to come.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Anybody who spends time in my company will learn in a very short time that I was a teacher in, and principal of, a school in the north-east inner city of Dublin. It effectively changed my life and the way I view the world. I learned more from those children than I ever taught them. When I became a school principal I got a wonderful bit of advice from a great colleague of mine named Mark Candon. He told me that regardless of the decision a principal makes, he or she will have conflict with staff colleagues, potentially with the parent body, definitely with the Department of Education and possibly with the board of management and others, but if a child is at the centre of every decision that is made, nobody will ever question the principal's integrity and, therefore, make sure that a child or children are at the centre of every decision made. If one analyses the education system from beginning to the end, it is very difficult to come to the conclusion that we have constructed a system that has a child, children or students at the centre of decisions that are made. If one was to start with a blank sheet of paper, which is what I believe should be done, one would not construct an education system like the one we have now. The second level system ends with the leaving certificate if the student gets that far. Many young people do not get that far. As a result of this pandemic, we have lost a generation of young people at risk. There is no legal requirement for these vulnerable young people to be in school after the age of 16 and, as a result of the pandemic and the lack of in-school learning, they have been lost to the system. The leaving certificate is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be overhauled radically because it does not have young students, human beings, at its centre. We have an education system that perpetuates inequality. It is rooted in inequality. If one asks Finnish politicians about the education system in Finland, they will say they had a discussion in their society about their education system and tried to find the theme or belief system that should underpin it. They came up with an answer. It is this radical idea called equality.Everybody buys into that notion, including the far left, the far right, the centre-right, the centre-left and centrists. They all believe that equality should underpin the education system. In Ireland, we believe that choice should underpin the system. The word "choice" sounds nice but it leads to competition between schools. In my constituency and others around the country, the notion of choice leads to open nights - when such things were possible - in September and October that encouraged parents to send their children to particular schools. That competition leads to a race for points, things like league tables and a stripped down and nasty discussion as to how one school is more successful than another. That, in turn, leads to a race among parents to try to get their kids into a certain secondary school because it has a certain reputation. In a given community, one then has a league table of secondary schools which inevitably means that a school at the bottom of the league table has a disproportionate number of young people from the Traveller community, migrants, young people with special educational needs and others who have been suspended, expelled or moved on from other schools. Many in society - I do not want to use the word "all" - are willing for that school to exist because there is a race for parents to get their young people into schools at the top of the ladder. It is not fair, does not work and is killing any sort of imagination or goodwill among students and teachers. Teachers are given the impression by parents and society that it is a waste of time to talk about stuff that is not on the curriculum. Parents feel they have to put their kids through the machine, so to speak. They can acknowledge that a school includes extracurricular activities but instead send their child to a grind school because they can afford it. The leaving certificate makes young people good at doing a leaving certificate. It does not make young people good at anything else. We need to overhaul and radically change the leaving certificate. We, as a political collective, need to be brave and say that, in this day and age, the leaving certificate is no longer fit for purpose. The leaving certificate is pretty much exactly the same now as it was when I sat it in 1994. I think most people who have gone through a leaving certificate year are still slightly traumatised by what they had to do in order to get through it. That is if a student made it that far. The Minister referred to the Cassells report. We always talk about the price tag attached to education in Ireland and most of the discussions that happen at the school gates or between parents and teachers or principals are about money. People have said to me that if they did not have to talk about money, they could actually talk about education. Staff in schools have told me that they are always asking about a fundraiser, talking about book money and voluntary contributions or being asked about those things. Parents just wish they could talk about education and the development of their children. When it comes to third level or further education, reference has been made to former Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, and his work in the 1960s but one only has to go back to the 1990s and another former Minister, Niamh Breathnach, to find the template of political will to abolish third level fees, the funding for which was found from a progressive taxation system. That is how these things should be done. I believe there is goodwill across this House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion that has been laid down. There is a fantastic opportunity for us to grab the initiative here because never before in my political lifetime has education been at the top of the political agenda, as it is now. Never before was there a thirst within the Irish population, the education body, teachers, parents and students to radically overhaul what we do. We should not be married or welded to the leaving certificate because it is the only thing we know. Let us take the opportunity to radically overhaul and reform it. Let us make third level and further education absolutely free. At least then we could return to the basic principle of putting the child at the centre of every decision that we make.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for transparent reporting by undertakings in relation to the risk of labour exploitation and human trafficking occurring in their supply chains or in any part of their business and of the steps taken by them to ensure such activities do not take place; and to provide for connected matters. This Bill is in my name and in those of Deputies Sherlock and Nash. The Tánaiste might have an interest in this legislation. We could potentially be world leaders when it comes to ending child exploitation and human trafficking globally. This Bill would require businesses to report annually on what measures they have taken to ensure that their products do not involve human trafficking and child labour exploitation.  Crises such as the pandemic in which we are living involve considerable amounts of self-analysis at community and national levels. A phrase that is often used is that we should not go back to normal when normal was the problem. There are, of course, issues in our country but there are also issues in the world. At the top of that list must be child exploitation and human trafficking. What are we doing in this small country of ours that has global reach in order to take a stand against child exploitation and human trafficking? We should require businesses and the commercial sector to ensure annually that no child exploitation or human trafficking were involved in the production of all products that are made or produced here. Every business in Ireland needs to make an annual declaration to that effect. That is what our Bill is seeking to do. This is a Bill that should get support from across the House. Notwithstanding the fact that the Tánaiste walked out in the middle of my presentation of this Bill, which addresses issues that come under his remit, it is a Bill that would do a lot of good. It would turn our minds annually, and I hope more often, to the issues of child exploitation and human trafficking, which continue to be a scourge across the world.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I agree with others that the Minister of State's presentation showed empathy and an understanding of the issue. The speeches of Ministers sometimes read like national car test reports but the Minister of State's did not. I am, however, stunned that there is no representative from the Department of Education present to hear this debate. In a properly functioning democracy, families of children with additional needs would not feel as if they are on their own or that they must not only deal with a challenging diagnosis, but also become full-time campaigners at the same time and wage war on the State to ensure basic provisions for their children. In a fully functioning democracy, such families would feel an envelope of care from their schools, the HSE and every Department, all of which would work to lift and empower children in a country which puts children at the centre of everything it does. What we actually have in this country are thousands of families who are completely exhausted because, in addition to dealing with what they have to deal with at home, they also have to campaign for the most basic provision for their children. The waiting lists for interventions and assessments are years long. There is also the absolutely pathetic sight of parents trying to get access to school places for their children only for the special educational needs organiser, SENO, to hand them a list of schools and wish them the best of luck. The "Prime Time Investigates" programme and the exemplary work of the whistleblower, Shane Corr, expose the contempt the State has for families who are dealing with difficult and challenging diagnoses. There is no envelope of care. We are not all in this together. The child is not at the centre of the conversation. Families will say that it is as if the State is asking them to please go private or to please be quiet and leave it alone. There is no representative of the Department of Education present.We have heard speeches about how the Minister of Education and the Ministers of State in the Department of Education will choose the side of the children with additional needs in any debate between teachers, SNAs and families with children who have additional needs. They have made such statements but in recent weeks I am pretty sure the only thing I have heard from the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special education and inclusion is how strongly she feels about The Kerryman newspaper. However, she is not here. This is a classic example of the cultural problem we have in this country when it comes to putting children at the centre of anything. The children and the families are considered to be the problem. If they decide to take on the State, by God the State will find out what it needs to find out about them. How often does this happen? I cannot believe the Department of Education and the Department of Health have said that this is common practice but the Minister of State has said that it is not good enough to say it is illegal if it is wrong. There are so many people and interest groups pulling and dragging all the time when it comes to debates on education or health. At the centre of all of this should be the children and the State should flip over until it snaps in order to ensure that children can be empowered and uplifted and can fulfil their potential. That never happens in these debates, however. This is not necessarily just a political issue, it is a cultural issue as well. What happens is that the children and the families are made out to be problematic and the State seeks to make sure that no other families will decide to go down a particular road again. I appreciate the Minister of State attending this debate and I appreciate her empathy. It is a disgusting disgrace, however, that no Minister or Minister of State from the Department of Education bothered to be here to listen to this debate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to raise with the Tánaiste the issue of youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate in Ireland now stands at 59%, which means that for every five young people in Ireland, three of them have no job.The EU average is 17%. It is considered to be extremely high in Spain at 40%, while in the UK, the rate is 14%.  I am sure the Tánaiste will agree that young people have been unfairly targeted over the course of this pandemic. They have been working incredibly hard within their own families and communities over the past year and over the past number of years they have changed Ireland for the better with their activism, engagement and campaigning. The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman said yesterday that it was the energy and activism of young people that brought the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas this week and he is right. We saw what happened earlier this year with their activism around the leaving certificate. Our fear in the Labour Party is that we are losing a generation again, as we did ten years ago. What we and the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, are asking for is a task force on youth unemployment. The Government needs to take this issue seriously because in the economy and in the country presented to these young people before the pandemic, 40% of young people under 30 were in insecure employment and far too many were in insecure accommodation. They are looking at a return to "normal" which means insecure jobs and high rents and many of them are wondering why they should hang around. We lost a generation ten years ago; we cannot afford to lose another one. We have a youth unemployment or joblessness rate of 59%. This falls within the ministerial responsibilities of the Tánaiste. What priority is he giving to this issue? Will he listen to the NYCI and establish a task force? What is he, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and his Government doing to tackle the issue of youth unemployment in Ireland?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know this is not a priority for the Tánaiste because I took the time last night to go through every single one of his tweets this year. Since January 2021, the number of times he mentioned youth unemployment came to the grand total of zero while the number of times he referenced Sinn Féin came to a grand total of 12. If I was a young person in Ireland, I would come to the conclusion that the Tánaiste's obsession is not with young people, youth unemployment, getting people jobs and saving this generation but with a political game with Sinn Féin. I counted zero tweets about youth unemployment but 12 tweets about Sinn Féin since the beginning of this year.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Climate change, as the Minister well knows, is the single biggest challenge facing humanity today. It is a problem of such an order of magnitude that it can be difficult for us to get our heads around it. The forests of the world are literally on fire. Twenty-four months ago the Amazon was on fire, 16 months ago Australia was on fire and this week the national parks in Kerry, the hills of Wicklow and the mountains of Mourne are on fire. Increasingly, we are looking at weather and temperature events which exceed some of the most pessimistic predictions of the international models. When we take into account the global dimming effect of particles in the air caused by burning fossil fuels and the extra warming that may take place as we replace fossil fuels the need for urgency and the scale of the consequences may be even greater than any of us care to admit. This is an existential challenge for society. In that context, all of us will be judged by our actions - by what we have done and what we have failed to do. By nature, I am an optimist. I look to the future. I believe that we can find a way to solve this problem but the first step is to admit that the entire current fossil fuel-based economic model is broken and that we have to replace it. We need to admit that we will only replace it by regulation. We cannot just close our eyes and hope that it goes away. We cannot pretend that it is other people's problem to solve or that the free market will magically produce a solution like a rabbit from a hat. In Ireland, we have some of the highest per capita emissions in the world. We cannot just look at China and India, shrug our shoulders and do nothing. Simply put, at a bare minimum we need to stop putting excess carbon into the atmosphere. We need a just transition to a carbon neutral future. We need that transition to bring people with us and to treat people fairly. This Bill is a step towards that process. It builds upon Deputy Alan Kelly's work in government in producing the first climate action Bill, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, in 2015. I am glad to see the Green Party has retained the framework of the Labour Bill. As spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment I can see the vast potential for employment in a carbon-neutral economy but we need to ensure that the transition is an orderly and managed one that creates benefits and opportunities for people across Ireland.We want a just transition that gives people the skills and education they need. We need to strengthen local democracy and examine new and old structures, such as town councils and co-operatives, to build organisations that will share costs and benefits more fairly in our communities. We need the State to invest, subsidise and regulate to make sure those who can least afford to pay are subsidised the most. We need to invest in active travel, walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure in towns and villages that are designed for people and not primarily for cars. We need to invest in large-scale public transport and we need considerable State investment in housing, transport and industry to deliver a carbon-neutral economy and infrastructure. Our greatest challenges lie in agriculture and construction. We need to put the needs of our people at the heart of how we face these challenges. We will need to change, but that change need not be at the expense of the ordinary person if we put his or her need for decent living at the heart of what we do. There is a nettle here to be grasped, and pretending we can stay the same will leave our farmers behind and ultimately prevent us from meeting the challenges of climate change and the collapse in biodiversity we have seen over the past 50 years. This Bill is about the economy and regulating it and with any attempt to regulate an economy, there will be some big business interests that will seek to delay, obstruct or damage anything that will force them to change. These forces need to be resisted. The common good is too important for us to cave in to the demands of those who do not want to change. We need to support those who are working towards a carbon-neutral economy based on decent, well-paid jobs and a good standard of living. We cannot allow those who are working to change for the better to be undercut and undermined by those who seek to earn a fast buck by cutting corners and exploiting natural and human resources without regard for environmental justice both here and abroad. Human rights and workers' rights are inextricably linked to climate change. The climate emergency threatens the social fabric of every country on earth, and Ireland is no exception. I have hope for the future and believe that, with good regulation and strong public and community engagement, we can get our economy to change. There are valid criticisms of this Bill. There are justifiable questions as to whether it goes far enough. Are the links between the carbon budget and the fiscal expenditure budgets too weak? Are the exact mechanisms too technocratic? Most of all, how can we make sure the Bill does not lose sight of the needs of the most vulnerable, rural and urban, and make sure the transition is, indeed, just? With these questions in mind, we will seek to submit amendments to improve the Bill. Ultimately, however, as my colleagues Deputies Howlin and Sherlock have said, we support and welcome this Bill because it is a step we need to take. We cannot afford to delay any longer. The Green Party deserves credit for putting it at the heart of its Government programme, and it would be cheap politics just to attack that party over the Bill's imperfections. I ask the Minister of State and everyone in this House to take this opportunity to listen to one another, honestly debate, examine and accept amendments, and work to produce a climate Bill we can be proud of. We have a duty to the Irish people, and to people everywhere, to deliver a carbon-neutral future with people at the heart of it and to bring positive change to people's lives as we go.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:“That Dáil Éireann: recognises that: — the special interests and strengths of people with autism are a vital part of our society and we lose out when their unique insight, experience and contribution is lost, and that they require and deserve inclusion, equality and accountability; — for people with autism and their families, the delays, cancellations and curtailments in healthcare, education and other public services caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have made what was already a poor situation considerably worse, and that as a result they are in a uniquely isolated and vulnerable position; and — this isolation has been reinforced by the discovery that the State, through the Department of Health, has surreptitiously compiled dossiers of sensitive personal information, from medical and other healthcare and educational sources, on children with autism, a practice that this Dáil should condemn, and the publication of an internal review into this matter will do nothing to restore confidence as it lacks the independence and transparency so urgently required; notes that: — the long-standing adversarial approach taken by the State, when services which children are entitled to, or urgently need access to, are absent or failing, has put major strain on families and carers, and destroyed the trust of many in the State; — early diagnosis and intervention for children with autism is critically important, but waiting times for both assessments and services have always been bad, and are now intolerable; — in a recent reply to a parliamentary question, the Health Service Executive confirmed an average 19-month waiting time for a child’s assessment of needs, with 5,078 assessment of need applications overdue for completion, which is in contravention of the legal requirements under the Disability Act 2005, where it is set out that assessments for children with additional needs, such as autism, should be commenced within three months and completed within six months; — less than 10 per cent of assessments of need are being carried out within the statutory time-frame, and this is in contravention of the Government’s own National Autism Plan which promotes timely access to diagnostic assessment, and which is indicative of the Government’s abject failure to support families of children with autism; — due to Ireland’s two-tier health service, families from more disadvantaged backgrounds, or without the financial resources, cannot access timely intervention, which is leading to increased levels of stress and difficulties for families of children with autism; — many provisions within the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 remain to be commenced; — €63,000 a day, or €11.6 million a year, is spent transporting children with autism and those with special needs in south Dublin to schools in other parts of the city, due to a failure to provide appropriate places locally; and — a study by Dublin City University academics in August 2020, showed that as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, a decline was reported for 61 per cent of children with autism, with parents noting: — a decline in their child’s ability to self-regulate emotions in the case of 34 per cent of children; — a decline in motivation to engage in activities, including school work, in the case of 18 per cent of children; and — a decline in academic skills such as maths, reading and writing, in the case of 14 per cent of children; and calls on the Government to: — commission a fully independent review, by a body other than the Department of Health, into the Department of Health’s practice of surreptitiously compiling dossiers of sensitive personal information, from medical and other healthcare and educational sources, on children with autism; — introduce a new national autism empowerment strategy, which would take a rights-based approach to the inclusion and acceptance of people with autism in Irish life, that recognises the significant strengths of people with autism and places their voices, and those of their families, at the heart of the planning and decision making process, is underpinned by a budget and by draft legislation, and for the strategy to be published and submitted for the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of July, and that the strategy should include: — direct involvement in its development from people with autism and their families, through the establishment of a working group and direct consultation with the community; — learning from best practice abroad, such as Malta’s Persons within the Autism Spectrum (Empowerment) Act 2016, and to lay out the establishment of an Irish autism advisory council, similar to the Maltese Autism Advisory Council, to advise and guide Government on autism strategy and which holds Government to account; — the immediate abandonment of the new standard operating procedures for assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005, which have reduced assessments of children to a meaningless box-ticking exercise, and to put in its place a system for professional, multidisciplinary, in-depth assessments of need that will provide both a detailed description of a child’s needs as well as setting out proposals for tailored, specific and evidence-based intervention; — urgent action to address waiting lists for assessments of needs, occupational therapy, speech and language, audiology and other areas of concern, with the immediate recruitment of additional therapists to ensure early intervention; — a best practice model of service delivery, assessment, diagnosis and intervention for service users with autism, drawing on international expertise, with guidance for health service providers on how to meet the needs of both children and adults with autism, and their families and carers; — a clear and detailed intervention plan, funded and time-bound, on support services for families and carers, and a fully established roadmap on how family support services are to be developed; — appropriate amendments to the definition of disability in equality legislation, so as to include specific reference to autism and other developmental issues that affect a person’s capacity to take part in social interactions or to form social relationships, and to incorporate a rights-based, child-centred and inclusive approach; — a sustained autism inclusiveness campaign and the provision of autism inclusion procedures and real engagement, including training for all professionals who frequently deal with adults with autism; — appropriate regulation of autism services and therapies and recommendations on appropriate action to be taken in relation to therapies which are not medically, or evidence based, make false claims or are dangerous to the welfare of people with autism; — the inclusion of a question on autism in the next national census to determine the number of people with autism in the State; — the implementation of the recommendations of the report entitled ‘Unmet Needs - A report by the Ombudsman for Children’s Office on the challenges faced by children in Ireland who require an assessment of their needs’, including and not limited to: — additional resources, including a refund element for private assessment to get to grips with the significant waiting lists; — changes to the Disability Act 2005, to ensure a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to the assessment and identification of a child’s development needs; and — recognition of the special educational needs of children in legislation, via changes to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, to ensure these needs are met in a timely and appropriate manner; — the commencement and resourcing of all relevant disability legislation without delay; — in relation to adults with autism, access to diagnostic services, to key worker support and appropriate mental health care where required, and a pathway of care which clearly maps services and ensures their consistent availability across the State and outlines how the healthcare, educational, employment and social needs of adults with autism are to be addressed throughout their lives and across the public service in terms of access to services, justice, housing, employment and social inclusion, with parity of access as the underpinning goal; and — a clear system of accountability and scrutiny relating to autism service provision.”Notes were being taken. When a family who are adjusting to the realisation of a challenging diagnosis come into contact with the services of the State, they should assume a culture of partnership, compassion and care, but notes were being taken. They fear for their child because of an autism diagnosis and ask how he or she will navigate the world. They wonder whether the child will have to endure prejudice, misunderstanding or isolation, and ask themselves who will partner with them to empower him or her, but notes were being taken. Parents have long waiting lists, of 18 or 19 months for an assessment of need or of 35, 36 or 40 months for some essential interventions. Why are these periods counted in months? Thirty-six months is three years. They ask these questions at night, heartbroken at the sight of their sleeping three-year-old, who will be six years old by the time their country comes to their aid, but notes were being taken. In rooms where the compassion of the State should have been most manifest, notes were being taken to add to a dossier that would be used in a court case. If a parent was so exhausted and frustrated by the failures of this country to empower his or her child that he or she turned to the legal route, the State would turn to its notes. They are dossiers not just on the child but on his or her entire family. The "RTÉ Investigates" programme broadcast last month exposed the culture of confrontation that emanates from the corridors of the permanent Government: notes were being taken. While the exposé was shocking, it was somehow, ironically, completely unsurprising because no one who has ever had to embark on this adventure with an autistic child would be in any way surprised by the culture, the systemic failures and the institutionalised obstacles we promote as a child-centred approach. No western democracy would attempt to stand over such pathetic waiting lists. No genuine republic would force parents to go on a hopeless merry-go-round trip of local schools to access a place for their child, and no country with aspirations for all its children would force families to the courts when they try to vindicate their rights and then reach into a filing cabinet or download a file within which is a dossier compiled by taking notes. We in the Labour Party want the Government to take note. We want Dáil Éireann and the citizens to take note. Autistic people are a gift, an inspiration, a guiding light for all of us. We are enhanced, empowered and enlightened by them. Their potential is limitless; all they need is a society willing to listen, learn, love, empower and take note of who they are. There was a man more than 100 years ago who took notes. He took notes for an address he would never make, during a struggle and a time after which he would be long forgotten. His name was Tom Johnson, the leader of the Labour Party in 1919. He was entrusted with the honour of scripting the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil. As voices such as his struggled to be heard over the sound of gunshots from the men and women of war and of flags, he wrote of the children. In his well-crafted notes, he wrote:The Irish Republic shall always count its wealth and prosperity by the measure of health and happiness of its citizens. It shall, therefore, be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to ensure that no child shall endure hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, that all shall be provided with ample means and facilities requisite for the education and training of free citizens of a free Gaelic nation. A condition precedent to such education is to encourage by every reasonable means the most capable, sympathetic men and women to devote their talents to the education of the young.We should reflect on the notes he took and the words he used, such as "health", "happiness", "physical, mental and spiritual well-being" and the need for "sympathetic men and women to devote their talents to the education of the young". This is the founding document of our State, of the Oireachtas. It is said of Tom Johnson that he wept openly when he heard those words read aloud as he had written them in his notes. Have we failed that aspiration, that purely republican aspiration, for the well-being of the children of the sympathy, understanding and compassion of that same State? As today these children try to find their voice between the flag-wavers and the tax-cutters, they now need to be empowered. We need a national autism empowerment strategy to correct the mistakes of the State and to embed here the international best practice of others. The Maltese autism Act is a template this country should work from, an Act that in its citation seeks "to empower persons within the autism spectrum by providing for their health and well-being in society, the betterment of their living conditions, their participation and inclusion in society and to make ancillary and consequential provisions thereto in full adherence to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability." There are those words again, as if inspired by Tom Johnson, "health", "well-being", "inclusion" and "betterment". It is an Act of empowerment and defiance that in the face of generations of misunderstanding, prejudice and underfunding, autistic people are now ready to defy the odds, the history of their state and the expectations of their country to live full, productive, healthy and love-filled lives. We should compare notes with Malta. At the heart of the Maltese legislative achievement and of our motion is accountability. It is what parents are crying out for, in regard to service providers, to when mistakes are made and gaps need to be filled, and to this House, Dáil Éireann. These are the notes the Minister of State and the Government need to take. They should take note from Malta and the advocacy groups and parents' associations that are crying out for the State to take some of the burden in this empowerment process. I refer to groups such as those in Dublin 6 and 6W, which are working with Senator Bacik, or in Dublin 12, which I have met with Senator Moynihan and which are changing the world for their children, or to the children I have met in my constituency such as James Field and Abigail Cahill, who have changed my entire understanding of the world in which they live. The Government should listen to groups such as AsIAm, which empowered us in the Labour Party to draft our motion. It is not right that parents feel they are at war with their Government and State.It is exhausting, humiliating and defeating. They make phone call after phone call, write letter after letter, get referral after referral, are put on waiting list after waiting list and contact school after school and, all the while, notes are being taken. In recent days, we have been flooded with stories from all over the country which should shame us all. I refer to the mother in Limerick who has been told there is no space for her child in any local school and so must travel to Nenagh twice a day, covering a total of 184 km every day, because the transport needs of her child have not been resolved. Why should that mother believe that anyone cares? How can she possibly believe in this republic as she drives past the schools that cannot take her child in her own car because transport has not been arranged to take her child to a town in another county, 46 km away, simply because her child is autistic? Many wonder if it is because of notes that the State is slow to respond. I refer to euro notes. Millions of those euro notes could be saved by empowering our autistic citizens. The money the Government thinks it is saving as it hopes that parents will access private assessments or therapy is a pittance when compared with the money that would be saved by preventing a young person with autism from becoming vulnerable. Such people are more likely to enter homelessness, to experience unemployment or to fall prey to addiction. If the Government thinks empowerment is expensive, it should try disempowerment. There is, however, hope, ambition, vision and empowerment. We ask Government to support our motion. It involves an empowerment strategy that focuses not only on health and education, but on housing, transport and employment as well. We say to the autistic children, young people, women and men of Ireland that there is a reason "autism" sounds like "awesome". We say to them that they should strike their own note, sing their own song, play their own instrument in their own way and in their own time, and march to the beat of their own drum. We need them and we celebrate them. They empower us. We will empower each other. We say to their families that they are not raising their children to be second-class citizens; we will not permit it. We commend this motion for a national autism empowerment strategy to the House. It is time to stop taking notes. It is time to take action.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Barry for proposing this Bill, which the Labour Party will be supporting. Oftentimes we come in here and try to make Government the enemy. Sometimes that is theatrics and sometimes there is a genuine reason behind it. In this instance, the Government has absolutely no defence. It has no defence in respect of this issue, the treatment of the Debenhams workers or the Duffy Cahill report, which, as has been said, has been sitting on an office shelf somewhere since 2015. It is absolutely indefensible for any Minister or Minister of State to stand in this Chamber and defend the fact that the recommendations of the Duffy-Cahill report still have not been implemented. It is absolutely inevitable that we will be back here again and again. As a result of the nature of the pandemic and the capitalist society in which we operate, companies will utilise this pandemic to force through redundancies. To deal with this on a case-by-case basis is to fundamentally fail the workers. The Minister of State can list the individual things the Government has done for the Debenhams workers, but to do so is to completely miss the point. Last November, Neasa Cahill and Kevin Duffy appeared before an Oireachtas committee. They said that company law did not need to be amended in order to implement the recommendations of their report. What did Government do in December? It asked the Company Law Review Group to review any company law that may need to be amended, despite the evidence that those who wrote the report gave to an Oireachtas committee. Now the Minister of State comes in here and insults the lot of us with a year-long delay to this Bill.  Every time we bring up issues of workers' rights, we are insulted by the Government. We were accused of virtue signalling when we brought in legislation on sectoral pay agreements. It was the same when we brought in a motion on youth unemployment and when we spoke about the lack of sick pay during a pandemic. What did the Government do? It said we will talk about it in six months' time. As we quite rightly said, no other sector of Irish society would have to wait so long - for six years - for the implementation of a report that does not go as far as this legislation. This is a reasonable report written by reasonable people which aims to prevent the very issue we are talking about today. In my own constituency, there are two instances of redundancies in Baldoyle affecting a total of 540 workers. How many more will there be over the coming months and years? Somebody in the Minister of State's position will trot in here and say that it is a difficult situation but that one must understand company law and that all of these individual circumstances are different. This will be said even though the Government has had a report since 2015 that would ensure that, in such circumstances, workers would not have to spend 400 days protesting to stand up for their rights. The Government has absolutely no defence.We in the Labour Party pay tribute to the Debenhams workers and other workers who, over many years, have taken a stand in this regard. We are sick, tired and sore of being forced to go down to picket lines with workers who should be sorted out at the start. There is no glory or honour from a Government point of view in saying it has respect for Debenhams workers or whatever other band of workers there may be in the future. The Government has the capacity and ability to sort this out now, so that other workers do not have to go through the same heartbreak in the future. What is the point of politics or legislative processes? What is the point of the over and back in this Chamber or of commissioning a report? What is the point in telling us that it will take one year or asking the Company Law Review Group to do its work when the Government does not do anything about a review for six years? It is absolutely indefensible. The Government has no defence. Once again, I and Deputies from other political parties will say the very same thing and we will get another response from another Minister or Minister of State who will say "Well, you know, we will have a look." As has been correctly said, we will hopefully get a resolution to the Debenhams issue. The Minister cannot come in here in some months' time when this inevitably happens again and say, with a straight face, that this is a particular situation, as the Tánaiste is so well-practised in doing. In any other aspect of public life or public policy, legislation can be rammed through in jig-time. This is why people sometimes lose faith in politics, Departments and Ministers. The Government asked the workers to put faith in the review and report and to trust the process, which the Clerys workers also did at one point, but six years after the report has been done, there is nothing. I suggest that the Minister come to the House next week. We will all forfeit whatever time is necessary for the Minister to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report so that we are not back here in a number of months' time dealing with what I fear will be an inevitable cascade of redundancies, for which companies will no doubt use the pandemic as cover. There are 540 such redundancies already in Baldoyle. If this was happening in Ballyhaunis, we would all hear about it. I ask the Minister to do his work. The Debenhams workers have done their work, having spent 400 days on the picket. None of us wants to see another band of workers go through the same thing. Six years is not good enough. I suggest that the Government do what it was asked to do six years ago by implementing the recommendations of the report. Do not insult the authors of the report by completely contradicting them only one month after they come before an Oireachtas committee.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is a technical Bill which does exactly what it says on the tin. It gives the relevant Ministers power to enter into agreements with the SBCI to implement loan guarantee schemes. The reason for the Bill's introduction is to enable the Government to deliver the Brexit impact loan scheme. The cost to the Exchequer of the Brexit scheme will be a maximum of €29 million with up to €500 million in low-cost finance being made available to viable micro-SMEs and mid-cap enterprises. It aims to assist them to adapt their businesses to the challenges caused by Brexit. We have one amendment from Deputy O'Reilly, which aims to get the Minister to engage with the relevant stakeholders and groups regarding favourable interest rates from moneys loaned under the Act, which is fine. The Labour Party will support both the Bill and the amendment. I want to raise some concerns about the Bill, related schemes and the other existing schemes, which are not enough. There are businesses falling through the cracks. Many small businesses were hit by Brexit and then suffered the double whammy of being smashed by the pandemic. However, they do not qualify for support from any of the current Government schemes and are not suitable or will not qualify for this one either. My concern is that too many of these businesses, particularly micro businesses, will be thrown to the wolves as they fall outside the different schemes being rolled out. I want to use the example of a small Irish service business connected to tourism but not a tour operator, whose owner was in touch with me yesterday. His business is headquartered and pays tax in Ireland. He had turnover of over €2 million at its height, mostly services exports, and has a good chance of a return to that when he can resume. Due to the nature of the business, he took a serious hit and was preparing for restructuring due to the threat of a hard Brexit. Then the pandemic hit and his business was eliminated almost overnight. He employs dozens of people directly and a similar number indirectly. The core of the business is in Ireland but his service is dependent on travel. As soon as recreational travel returns, the business will be able to recover and expand. However, it has been savagely hit by the lack of income and the standing costs it has had to support over the past year. He feels the State is offering him next to nothing, however. He got rate support for which he is grateful. He applied for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, but got nothing. When he applied for the Fáilte Ireland scheme, he was told by the Department he would get nothing. Under the terms and conditions of the loan scheme enabled by this Bill, he will also get nothing. If we do not support businesses like his and he is forced to close or is constrained in recovery, there is no guarantee that the business will be replaced by another Irish headquartered entity. The danger is we lose jobs, tax and revenue for lack of vision and flexibility in our supports structure. I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister on behalf of businesses like this. Hopefully, I am wrong and there is some scheme they can avail of which will help. Otherwise, viable firms like this could go to the wall. Small, medium and micro enterprises provide 70% of enterprise jobs. While we support this scheme and the Bill, it is important to remember at whom it is aimed. The Minister of State should make funds available for those firms which do not qualify for other schemes. No company should fold due to Brexit or the pandemic when there is a reasonable chance for it to regroup and rebuild its enterprise. It would be far cheaper to save existing jobs than to spend to regain others. I welcome positive engagement from the Minister of State on the constituent's business to which I referred. Hopefully, there will be a scheme available which will be helpful for similar businesses.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is very welcome. I thank her for producing legislation to underpin this process. It is timely and important. We worked together to waive the necessity for pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which was a good sign that we would work on this together. Respectfully I have to disagree with my Sinn Féin colleague on the issue of canvassing. The Labour Party is quite comfortable with these elements of the Bill. The message must be sent out to the entire education community that one cannot talk to a teacher about a particular student's accredited grade for the leaving certificate. That is just a no-go area on every level. If one does this, one may potentially impact negatively on a young person's future. That is strong message which should not be diluted. We know that people will find loopholes and mechanisms to-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Do we need-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is quite unusual.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is quite unusual for a contribution to be interrupted in that manner but, obviously, ordinary rules do not apply in certain circumstances. I hope my time can be replenished. My point is that, regardless of the very unusual circumstances, we have to send out a message that strictly no canvassing can take place on any level whether the student is aware of such canvassing. If we dilute this element of the Bill or dilute the sanction, people will find loopholes, as they always do in Irish society. We have seen that time and time again. While this measure is strict and tough, and potentially very difficult for students, this Bill must be clear that absolutely no canvassing on any level will be tolerated. We should proceed on that basis. It is a very important message, albeit a difficult one for young people to have to consider. There needs to be a sacred space for teachers to do their work without interference from anybody, whether this interference is known to the student or otherwise. The Minister made reference to school profiling, which is not part of this Bill or the accredited grades system. That is to be welcomed. I reiterate that it was the Minister who took out the school profiling last year following a campaign. She listened to people who had difficulties with it and she is to be commended on that. Again, as has already been stated, it was the advocacy and the campaigning zeal of young people and their ability to stay around the table with the Minister and her officials that got us to this point, at which young people have a choice. If young people are ever wondering about their power or potential to affect change, they should look at what happened throughout this entire process. It is there that the fruits of this power or potential can be seen. While we are supporting the Bill, I feel we have not yet learned the lessons of the 2020 leaving certificate. We are still awaiting an independent review of what happened last year. If that review had been completed, many of those lessons could have been learned and it would have impacted on the Bill. That is a shame. We certainly want to work with the Minister in the future to try to find a form of leaving certificate that adequately reflects the capabilities and potential of all students. Many people are particularly critical of the leaving certificate. While it is transparent and while people have a great level of faith in it and believe that it is fair, to a degree, there is also a sense that the leaving certificate makes one good at doing the leaving certificate rather than allowing young people to maximise their potential. There is a sense that many young people are losing out on their chances in life because they have to jump over the hurdle of the leaving certificate in the first instance. In general, the Labour Party is supportive of the Bill. We do not take lightly the canvassing element within the Bill. We feel that, while it is a tough measure, it is necessary. I can understand where the Minister is coming from with it and I will support her on it. We feel strongly about the review of last year's leaving certificate. I made points about the school profiling.  I know that the Minister agrees with me on my last point and that the Tánaiste has made similar points. It is an important point to make in respect of the pandemic and what we have gone through over the last year. This year has done damage to young people and it has left scars. A year of their school lives has been stolen, along with the socialisation and interaction they would have had. Teachers and special needs assistants were working all the while but remote working can never replace the school experience. While the Minister has made an announcement about summer programmes which may hope to repair some of that damage, the last year cannot be replaced or repaired over the course of a summer. We strongly suggest that we have potentially lost a generation of young people because, as we constantly say, people over 16 years of age are not required to be in school and many young people were lost to the system. Young people who are due to sit the leaving certificate next year are clinging on by their fingertips.School teachers and principals are trying hard to keep young people engaged in school and school learning. It has been challenging. In order to ensure that we do not lose a third generation, as it were, or year or cohort of young people to disengagement and choices that they may regret in later life, we must invest properly in a catch-up fund for young people akin to what has been done in the UK. Its fund is £1 billion. While its population is obviously larger than ours, something comparable would be of benefit in Ireland. Instead of trying to tackle the issue over the course of the summer, a fund would allow us to consider class sizes and investigate the damage that has been done and how we can repair the scarring, trauma and heightened anxiety of the past year. I do not just mean academic work, but other issues as well. This would be important. As the Minister knows, if there was a proposal for a road costing €150 million, any number of Government and Opposition Deputies would be jumping up and down saying that we could not but spend that €150 million on the road. When it comes to young people and children, however, the suggestion that €150 million would go a long way towards repairing the damage caused by a pandemic, people would scratch their heads and chins and say that that would be expensive and it could surely be spent on something else. This is the one chance that these young people will get, though. Unfortunately, they will have to tell their children and grandchildren for the rest of their lives how, when they were in school, there was a pandemic, as a result of which they lost out on in-class teaching. We will have a chance next year to try to repair that damage. The one mechanism we can use to do that is to invest in the expertise of our teachers and special needs assistants and listen to what they and school communities have to say. Repairing the damage may not be possible. For example, it may not be possible for infants to recover what they have lost. It will take a long time, but we have to try at least. We support the Bill, accept what the Minister is saying about canvassing and understand the necessity for a legislative underpinning of what she is doing. We have worked with her so as to forgo pre-legislative scrutiny, even though that is not something that should happen too often. We are still waiting on the review of what happened in 2020. Let us learn the lessons of 2020 and 2021 and ensure that if students of the leaving certificate class of 2022 are going to be in class all the time, which is our hope, proper resources are made available not just for them, but for every school group, school year, class group and class year at primary and secondary levels so that the scarring and difficulties they have experienced are recognised by the State and, at the very least, we can cling on to some of the young people who have been disconnected and discommoded and who are wondering whether they will return in September. That is a choice that young people are making right now. If there are 17-year-olds who are considering not going back to school in September, it poses a difficulty that they may regret for the rest of their lives. This is the one chance we have and we should grasp it collectively. On that basis, we support the legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I apologise for my late arrival. I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has facilitated my speaking slot. Deputy Richmond decided to walk to the convention centre rather get a lift with me, which would probably be illegal anyway, so he was here before me. This Bill is welcomed by the Labour Party. We can all appreciate the burden carried by the events industry and the workers in it, particularly those involved in music, arts, cultural festivals and large sporting events over the last 14 months. If we are lucky and reach a high vaccination rate, I hope we will see a return to being able to go to gigs, matches, shows and theatres, which we have missed so much, as soon as we possibly can. The human need to get together in celebration of life itself through events of all shapes and sizes, whether these are sport, music, art, performance or festivals, has never been more apparent. We miss it and its value has never been more keenly felt.  In that context, this Bill is as important as ever. The Bill looks to address the blatant exploitation by ticket touts, middle men and online scalpers of the huge demand for sporting, artistic and cultural events to drive huge profits into their own pockets well beyond any work they have done to earn the money.It is a classic example of where unfettered market rules disadvantage ordinary people, act as a drain on society and need to be curtailed for the common good. The pre-Internet days were bad enough for ordinary fans who could not get tickets, often being priced out of the chance of getting a second-hand ticket by the huge mark-ups charged by professional touts. Anyone who goes regularly to gigs or matches will know the feeling of being left with a spare ticket or multiple spare tickets due to the last minute backing out of a friend or group of friends from an event. You used to have to go to the ground and hope you could tell the difference between a genuine fan looking to see a match and a scalper looking to make a margin. It was a badge of honour for ordinary fans not to sell to ticket touts but with the advent of online selling, more and more people have been sucked into the idea that buying tickets for a big event is an opportunity to make a few quid. A larger and larger proportion of tickets seem to end up being bought at a price far higher than face value. Online ticket bots and sites have become an ever larger problem with orchestrated attempts to corner whole events and then drip feed the tickets out to genuine fans, to try to extract the last penny of cash far above the face value of the ticket. This is unbridled capitalism in its most naked expression and I welcome the Bill from the Government. It follows on from Bills from former Deputy Noel Rock and the now Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and from Deputy Quinlivan, all of whom should be congratulated for ensuring the issue became highlighted and is now being addressed. The other industry where we have an orchestrated drip feed of supply into a market of unsustainable prices by profit-driven monopolists is the property market. Some of the principles of fairness and capping sales prices at a sustainable level might be applied to try to solve the ongoing housing crisis in the country and to allow the property market to become one where builders are incentivised to create and build affordable homes for people and families, rather than one where speculators drive and create shortages and bubbles to exploit for maximum gain. On the detail of the Bill, I note the Department said it had been intended to tackle the use of bot software to purchase tickets but that it now plans to implement that as part of a Bill to implement EU Directive No. 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules, to be submitted to Government early next year. The delay concerns me as the bot issue should be addressed urgently and to pass a Bill without bot provision could conceivably leave us longer than necessary without appropriate protection. Within the Bill there are specific provisions for Euro 2020. Given that we are no longer hosting matches, do we need such specific provision in the legislation in the pandemic? The Bill also includes for secondary ticket markets the defence that they were providing an online service for others to comply with Directive No. 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce in the Internal Market. The concern I have is that the defence could be exploited to allow the profit of secondary platforms from this now illegal activity, based on them only supplying an information service to the people committing the crime. While it would be difficult to prevent private conversations through online and social media platforms like email, Facebook, Instagram or other services, platforms and actors could build a business model explicitly on the sale of tickets while turning a blind eye to lawbreaking and over-face-value sales and would be able to use section 26 as a defence to render the Bill ineffective and flout the law.  Many of the other provisions of the Bill seemed straightforward mechanisms for application for registration of venues and events. These designations seem reasonable, as do the provisions for arrest and the penalties. I look forward to a constructive debate and may submit amendments as needed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is on the same topic. It is on amending the earnings disregard for qualification for a SUSI grant to include support received by students in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment. It will give the Minister an opportunity to expand on what he has already said.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It may not be a major factor in every case but for the individual cases in which it may be a factor, it could be life-changing. This is the issue. My understanding is that there is a €4,500 income disregard applied to any income earned during the period for the SUSI grant applications and students are being advised that income from the PUP payment is not included in the income disregard. I am asking the Minister that the PUP be automatically included in the income disregard for applicants of the SUSI grant scheme because, as the Minister has repeated, there does not appear to be a huge problem. However, the Minister must concede that even if it is in one case, it will be life-changing for that individual student. Given the circumstances that we have all lived through for the past year, it is not worth it for this anomaly to continue to stand over a system that should be more flexible considering the type of industries that students normally work in, such as the hospitality sector and retail.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«At what point will the Minister be satisfied that the system that he is overseeing will meet all the requirements that he hopes it will meet?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a citizens' assembly on the issue of drugs. There is growing momentum for a radical rethink of our entire drug strategy. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe and there is a belief that this supposed war on drugs is killing marginalised people. There is a view that we need to decriminalise the drug user - not decriminalise drugs or legalise them, but take the drug user out of the criminal justice system. The Taoiseach will have seen the recent report about an individual who was in court in Cork charged with possession of cannabis worth €4. The Government has made a commitment to the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs. When is it intended to establish the latter?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Has the Taoiseach sought to meet Mr. Edwin Poots since he became leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP? We are very much at risk of a further breakdown in relations, and Mr. Poots is of the view that North-South relations have never been worse. Ms Nichola Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, has sought legal advice on the boycott by the DUP of the North-South Ministerial Council meetings. Has the Taoiseach received any advice on this? The North-South Ministerial Council is a key part of the Good Friday Agreement.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Bacik and I have been advocating for quite a while for a catch-up fund for children in the next school year. The Taoiseach will be aware of the scarring and damage experienced by young people and children, particularly disadvantaged children, in the past year or so owing to the lack of in-school tuition. The UK has provided a fund of £1 billion. The Government here has allocated approximately €40 million for a summer programme. Will the Taoiseach speak to the necessity for catch-up funding?  Will he also speak to the need for all schools to retain their current teaching posts? I am aware of a school in Ardfert outside Tralee that is losing a teacher. A number of other schools have contacted me with regard to losing teachers. Is it not time for a moratorium on schools losing teachers in order that we can repair the damage that has been done to children and young people over the course of the last year? That was not the Government's fault, of course, but we must invest to drive down class sizes and overcome and repair the substantial scarring and damage that occurred in the past year.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes, I am happy to proceed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Tánaiste will be aware that there were two announcements in the Baldoyle area over the past six months that are to result in the loss of over 540 jobs. Will the Tánaiste work with local representatives to discuss this issue? What plans does his Department have to deal with this, to ensure there will be no further job losses in the Baldoyle area and to ensure that those affected by these announcements will get all the supports they need?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wrote to the Tánaiste a month ago seeking a meeting with all local representatives to discuss the situation in Baldoyle. In the past six months there have been two separate announcements of job losses, affecting more than 540 people. I wrote to him again to seek a meeting with our local representatives. Does the Tánaiste feel that our local representatives, Deputies from all parties, are part of the solution? We are, obviously, in daily contact with many of the people who are affected by this issue. We want to ensure that Baldoyle represents a viable investment opportunity in the future. With two such announcements in a short period of time, the least I would have expected from the Tánaiste is that we would have had that meeting of all representatives. Two letters later and we are still no closer to that meeting. I again ask him to use the opportunity of this forum and this interaction with me to commit to having that meeting so that we can work together to avoid further job losses in Baldoyle and to ensure we get support for those affected by the job losses that have been announced.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Tánaiste's remarks and his commitment to having a meeting. He will appreciate that I might be a bit frustrated. In two letters from me over the course of a month, I did not get anywhere. Then in an oral exchange in this Chamber I have now got a commitment to a meeting. However, I will take that in good faith and we can certainly work together. If two such announcements involving more than 540 job losses happened anywhere else in the State, I am sure that a slew of Ministers would be travelling to that location to say how hard they were working to ensure that there would be no further announcements and that they would give as much support as they possibly could to the workers affected. Some of the remarks made, particularly the Sudocrem announcement about the site in which it was operating, were particularly concerning. I hope the Tánaiste will appreciate that we are trying to protect the futures of the workers involved and also to ensure that the remarks made by the withdrawing companies will not be replicated in the coming period.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I, too, am disappointed with the response of the Minister of State. Ireland has had a dysfunctional relationship with property and housing for many years and it is making a great many people utterly miserable. Highly disproportionate amounts of people's incomes are shovelled into mortgage repayments and rents every month. That money could be spent on their families, on life and on connectivity with other human beings. Instead, we have all been sucked into the race to believe we have to chain ourselves to a mortgage for 30 or 40 years and spend a vast and disproportionate percentage of our income on servicing that mortgage. We are led to believe we have to spend vast amounts on rent to survive. For years, we have handed the entire housing game to the private sector. This leads to people trying to make a quick buck. That leads, in turn, to issues like those we have seen this week in Donegal, Mayo and throughout the country, as well as issues in my constituency of cowboy developers building apartment blocks that are not fit for purpose. Ten, 15 or 20 years later these issues then come to the fore. We have people who are utterly miserable. The belief system is that this is the way it must be. People take the view that they must get on the ladder. This is a legacy issue. It is part of our cultural mentality that this is the way it should be. We convince people that they need to build their castle. Once a person builds the castle and is spending all that money on it and investing blood, sweat and tears in a mortgage, he or she will defend that castle. This leads to a lack of social cohesion. What happens is that people, in what is in many circumstances an understandable attempt to defend their castle, cannot look beyond it. Thus, the social cohesion needed within the wider community is lost. There will be objections to HSE facilities, social housing in the community, halting sites and other local developments because we have convinced everyone that they need to get a castle and plough money into it. Even though this is making people miserable, they believe they must defend it. We cannot change the Irish psyche overnight. We understand the need for security and to have a home and live and raise a family in it. However, there has to come a point when we realise that we are in a cycle of misery. We come back again and again to the issue of housing. It has collapsed Governments and almost collapsed our country ten years ago. It has brought the political system into disrepute. There have been tribunals. Why? They came about because of bribes. Why? They arose from housing, developers, dirty politics and brown envelopes. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were up to their necks in it. There comes a point where we have to stop, change and believe we can do better. We have to understand that there is potential for a better way which the entire country can buy in to so that we do not have to be forever on the misery wheel. We may think it is making us happy but it is actually making us desperately unhappy. Think of all the money we could be spending on our children and families and on our lives. The Kenny report spelled it out in 1974, which was before I was born. The suggestion was made that the Bill is pre-empting policy or is somehow previous. To be honest, we cannot take that comment seriously. Then it was suggested that we should delay Second Stage for 12 months. As my colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, said, that shows the Government does not understand the seriousness of the situation.If we are serious about housing, if we realise how immense this issue is for young people who are locked out of the housing market, for the generations of people who are living in the same home, for people spending money on rent which they cannot afford and for the country being done in by dodgy developers, then this is the type of Bill that the Government should definitely support, and support today and not in 12 months time.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Bacik and I have been campaigning since February for a catch-up fund for children. The Government must invest in education for children who have lost out on in-school learning over the past year and a half or so. The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, announced two weeks ago she was working on a multimillion euro fund to this end. She said she would announce it shortly. She was not in a position to say when or how much. The Tánaiste will be aware that a major controversy has arisen over the catch-up for children fund in the UK. The catch-up tsar resigned over the fact the fund was only £1.4 billion. Does the Tánaiste agree with me that whatever summer programme is rolled out this summer will not be enough to help children to catch up, particularly those in disadvantaged areas or with learning challenges? When will this catch-up fund be announced and how much will be in the fund?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Ministers of State. I am a little bit taken aback by the Minister of State's address as it appeared she wanted to inform the House that everything is basically okay, that everything is fine, that Government is on top of things and that there is nothing to see here. Anybody who understands the education system well, and particularly how it interacts with the health system, will know that there were very significant problems before the pandemic. If the Minister of State were to stand up, acknowledge that and say that she appreciates that there are issues and that she is going to work with every agency, with the Opposition and with families and communities to resolve them rather than read out a list of ticked boxes to show how great the Government is doing, we might actually believe she is in a position to bring about great changes. I will fill her in on the reality of my constituents, who are waiting years for their children to get basic assessments and basic interventions. They do not have a right to automatic placement in a primary school. They get a list of schools from the special educational needs organiser and are basically told to fend for themselves. We also have an issue which has become quite profound over the course of the pandemic. As I hope the Minister of State will understand, children with special educational needs have been profoundly affected by the lack of in-school learning. On that basis, although the pandemic is clearly not the Government's fault, it is the Government's responsibility to respond with a fund, investment or vision to catch these children up. We are not going to heal the scars of the last year and a half with a summer programme. I mentioned this to the Tánaiste earlier. Two weeks ago, the Minister for Education announced her intention to establish a multimillion euro catch-up fund for children for next year. There has been an enormous political row in the UK over the level of the catch-up fund announced in England. The person who was responsible for distributing that fund resigned on the basis that it was only £1.4 billion. It appears that this Government feels that, if we can make a little bit of an investment over the summer, we need no real radical overhaul of how the system presents itself to families and to children and no radical overhaul or investment with regard to class sizes, what children are going through or the level of campaigning parents have to undertake, and the exhaustion they have to experience, to get basic services. All of us, including myself, are dealing with parents in our constituencies. I have been speaking to Senator Bacik about parents in Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6 and Dublin 6 West who cannot get a unit for their children. The State seems unable to stand up for these families or to interact proactively with patron bodies to ensure children can get access to these services in the areas they are from. I suggest to the Minister of State that there are major holes in the system and that they existed before the pandemic. What we need from Government is a multimillion euro investment in the education system that will attempt, first of all, to repair the scars of the last year and a half and, second, will move us towards a system that is more reflective of the education system of a modern European republic. The issues I am raising are real. The exhaustion of families is real. The lack of services is real. The waiting lists are real. In my part of the world, children are waiting so long for basic interventions that they become no longer eligible for those interventions and so have to go on another waiting list. All the while, there is a hint, sense or feeling that the system is begging people to get these services privately because they can then be taken off the list and will no longer be the system's problem. As I am sure the Minister of State will know, only a certain number of families have the means to do so. I again suggest to the Minister of State that, rather than standing up and giving a self-congratulatory speech on how everything is going fine, thank you very much, she should realise the level of scarring in Irish society and that it will take a massive package to allow some children and families to catch up to where they would like to be. We could then have a proper discussion with regard to where we were before the pandemic hit, when the system certainly was not serving children with disabilities or their families in any way that would be commensurate with what we should expect in a proper republic.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to ask the Minister the status of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019; her plans to proceed with the Bill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister. She will agree with me that it is important that we put children and young people at the centre of the education discussion and for far too long that has not been the case. It has been remarked to me on a number of occasions that what the Department tends to understand better than anything else are teachers and buildings but that when it comes to young people and children, they are too often not at the heart of our education discussions. I want to pay tribute to the Minister on the leaving certificate discussions. She put the voice of the student at the heart of all those discussions. They were at the table, they were listened to and they were consulted with. At the end of the day, the Minister listened and acted on what they felt was best for their cohort. That is to the Minister's credit and we have had a better leaving certificate process as a result of that and the Minister's open-mindedness. A definite timeline for this would be appreciated and would represent progress.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister's comments. We share the ambition of putting the child and the student at the heart of the education discussion. Schools have broken up for the summer. Yesterday would have been the last day for many primary schoolchildren. They are moving on to the next stage of their education and some of them are moving into second level. Can I ask the Minister about the commitment she gave a month ago on a catch-up fund? I was appreciative of the Minister's comments that Senator Bacik and I have been campaigning on this since last February and the Minister made a commitment on 3 June that a catch-up fund would be announced to enable children, not just in terms of a summer programme but over the course of the next year, to repair some of the damage that has been caused by the lack of in-school teaching. There was teaching and learning going on but as the Minister knows, much of it was outside of school and done remotely. Can I get an update on the Minister's intention to announce and fund a catch-up fund for next year?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This relates to the leaving certificate for next year. Has the Minister made any decisions or have plans been put in place for leaving certificate 2022? Will such decisions be made in a timely fashion so teachers, students and parents will know the position when schools return in September?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In the course of the conversations over the past few days about NPHET, advice, a question mark - although not a major one - was placed beside the potential return to school in September. Nobody expects that to be an eventuality but it has still been brought into the conversation. Would it not be a cleaner or better for the Minister to decide now to roll out leaving certificate 2022 exactly as the leaving certificate for 2021 has been rolled out, with a choice for students? Fifth year students have lost quite a number of months of in-school tuition in this calendar year. Would it not make more sense for the Minister to make the decision now that students going into sixth year next year would have the exact same experience as those who did the leaving certificate last month? We are not yet out of the pandemic and we cannot make any predictions about what will happen with variants.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I understand that the Minister needs to go through with the wide-ranging consultation with students, parents, teachers and other representatives. A number of months of in-school tuition have been lost to that fifth year cohort now going into sixth year. The July plans have already been delayed and NPHET is suggesting the potential, if everything went badly wrong, for a question mark over the reopening of schools in September. I appreciate that the Minister cannot make a definite decision on the floor of the House.Can we not keep within our decision-making parameters the potential for the exact same scenario to happen in 2022 as happened in 2021? Were the Minister to make an early decision in that regard, it would be greatly appreciated as we would not have to go through six months of campaigning to get to the very same point we reached six months ago.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is the type of politics that people do not often see or comment on enough. It shows the positive side of this House, whereby a piece of progressive legislation is presented by the Opposition, in this case by Deputy Pringle following on from the work of former Senator Kelleher, and is accepted and supported by Government in an attempt to advance and improve the lives of a particularly vulnerable group. I thank the Minister for supporting the Bill. In respect of Irish politics, I would also say that we should be thankful that we do not have a mainstream political party in Ireland that plays the race card. Every other European country has one, but we do not. There are individual politicians who say stupid, ignorant things at election time. However, no mainstream political party to date has played the race card or the anti-immigrant card, outside of a referendum in 2004. We should cling to that and build on it. What every child, person and human is looking for is a sense of belonging, to feel significant, wanted and needed. In the history of this State, we often undertook an experiment of sameness, where we presented, through our education system, an experience of Irishness that made many children feel that they did not belong, were not needed and were not significant. I know of people in my community who were brutalised for the sin of playing soccer. I know that middle Ireland feels a little dismissive about the idea of a community that gets excited about disco dancing instead of Irish dancing. Generations of young people were taught by Christian Brothers who were, in many instances, deeply unhappy people. They were teaching in parts of the country that they did not want to be in and teaching children they did not understand. They were teaching a language, in the Irish language, that was completely alien to the experience of the children they were teaching. Within all that, we now have potential, through this Bill, to empower, enrich and lift every child with the experience of our Traveller people. I played a part in the recognition of Traveller ethnicity. As has been mentioned, it was a proud day in 2017 when the ethnicity was recognised of people who exist as part of this nation. The Minister mentioned in her speech that she felt the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was progressive.It is but there is a provision in it that I hope she will agree needs to be amended. It provides for 25% of places to be kept for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. The problem for the Traveller community is that this would affect it disproportionately because if a child's father or mother did not go to secondary school, he or she would compete for the places at a disadvantage. I hope the Minister will support the Labour Party amendment to that Bill at some stage, as she said she will. In trying to seek significance or belonging, the power of having your culture and who you are reflected within the education system is incredibly emotional. It is incredibly emotional for a young person to feel he or she belongs. It is difficult for young persons to come to terms with the fact that they do not belong because of who they are and that there is nothing they can do about it. This causes internal frustration and anger and starts a lifelong quest for belonging that can sometimes be obtained in destructive or negative ways. With this Bill, we have an opportunity to change radically how we approach our education system. I impress on the Minister the necessity of having a teaching profession that reflects the children the teachers are teaching. We should have more teachers from Traveller, immigrant, working-class, disadvantaged and disability backgrounds so every child will feel significant and wanted and that he or she belongs.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is good to be back in this House. I think it is the first time since December. Hopefully we can resume regular business here soon. The Labour Party is happy to support the Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021. This Bill has been brought before us without pre-legislative scrutiny as a matter of urgency. Unlike some other Bills which have been rushed through, this Bill is indeed urgent and is suitably concise and limited to be progressed rapidly. It is extremely important that we get this Bill right. There is a constant battle in the State between those who seek to protect and enhance the rights of workers and those who seek to challenge them. We see consistent attempts to undermine any legislative protections afforded to workers, especially when they involve the strengthening of collective bargaining, the roles of trade unions or giving a seat at the table to represent workers. The Labour Party has always stood on the side of workers and their rights to collective bargaining and trade union representation. In considering this Bill, we believe that those rights are essential to a functioning democracy. I was delighted to see the recent judgment of the Supreme Court stating that the provisions of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 were constitutional. This Act was introduced by my party colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, and paved the way for thousands of workers in low-paid and poorly organised sectors to take advantage of sectoral orders to improve their pay and terms and conditions. In his ruling on that legislation, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton stated:The 2015 Act seeks to promote or to preserve high standards of training and qualification and by a subordinate body searching for, and the Oireachtas ultimately approving, fair and sustainable rates of remuneration. All these are objectives well recognised in a modern democratic society that strives for both economic dynamism and for social protection; an aim that becomes unachievable in chaos or stagnation. These must be recognised as being legitimate matters which the Oireachtas can pursue or seek to achieve.The sectoral order legislation was a major undertaking to remedy the implications of a judicial decision. I hope that those who are critical of the Bill will give credit where credit is due and recognise that the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 is an important achievement by the Labour Party in government in strengthening the rights and terms and conditions of workers as well as the practical effectiveness of collective bargaining. While the substance of that Act was vindicated, we are here because of another court case which has resulted in the need for amended legislation. I hope that this Bill will further strengthen the working of the industrial relations apparatus of the State, which is the WRC in this case. It has been clear since the Ryanair judgment that more formality about how the Labour Court adjudication officers arrive at their decisions will be required as a response to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Zalewski case. This Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is imperative to allow the WRC to resume its vital work. The two major findings of the case were that a blanket prohibition on public hearings was not justified and that there should at least be capacity to take an oath for the process to be constitutional. The proposed amendment gives adjudication officers discretion in cases which have been referred to them to decide that either all or part of the case proceedings can take place in private if the nature, circumstances or interests of justice make it preferable. The default position would be for these to be held in public. Given the often sensitive nature of cases for both sides, I hope and expect that, by agreement, many cases will in practice be heard in private. A strength of the WRC is that damage to individuals and indeed companies from publicity surrounding cases can be avoided. The Bill also provides for either side applying to have either part or all of the proceedings held in public. The paragraph to be substituted for subsection (14) provides for an adjudication officer effectively to direct the commission not to name parties in the published decision, which I think is merited. The Bill provides for an adjudication officer to hear evidence on oath and the Government seems to think it necessary to make provision for an offence such as perjury. This offence is provided for in six separate amendments to other legislation, set out in sections 4, 6 and 9 to 12 of the Bill. On a technical point, the memorandum accompanying the Bill states "aligned with section 12 of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018 (Bill 112 of 2018)." However, the Oireachtas recently passed the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 21 June and came into immediate operation. In that Act, a judicial or other proceeding includes proceedings before any "person having by law power to hear, receive and examine evidence on oath". It would therefore include proceedings before adjudication officers once they are given the new power to administer oaths. Under section 2(1) of the Act, a person commits the offence of perjury if he or she in or for the purpose of such proceedings gives a statement material in the proceeding while lawfully sworn as a witness that is false, and he or she knows to be false. This seems to cover the same grounds as the new offences created in today's Bill. The Act goes on to deal with several important matters related to the offence of perjury, including subornation, incitement, collaboration etc. Given that the Act places perjury on a statutory footing for the first time in a consolidated and simplified manner, and that it will apply across the board, including to the proceedings before the WRC, would it be unnecessary and perhaps unworkable, without any reference to that legislation, to include separate provision on exactly the same subject matter in the current Bill? I could be mistaken but given the time pressure due to the large volume of accelerated business in the House and the general increase in everyone's workload due to Covid, which I think everyone would acknowledge, I would be grateful if the Minister and Government could indulge me and refer this point to receive relevant legal examination before Committee Stage. While the facility for an oath is required from a constitutional point of view, a strength of the process is the absence of some of the intimidating trappings and legalese that can be associated with full judicial court proceedings.I hope that in the day-to-day operations of the court it will not be necessary to invoke the provision in every aspect of every case. Section 3 of the Bill sets down provisions to remove adjudicators which, hopefully, will be rarely, if ever, needed. We can all agree that the importance of passing this Bill is paramount. I look forward to the discussion of any amendments and, hopefully, we can pass this Bill quickly to allow resumption of the full operation of the WRC and that it will be improved in the interests of everyone.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«cThis is a Bill whose aims we in the Labour Party consider reasonable. The objective is to try to put in place a SCARP to reduce the number of companies that go into liquidation and instead to give them access to an affordable rescue plan, an alternative and lower cost version of examinership. In the context of Covid, there is pressure on hundreds if not thousands of companies in affected industries that are struggling to survive. We must ensure that perfectly viable companies that are hamstrung by Covid-related debts and obligations have a choice between the new SCARP provided for in this Bill and liquidation. I understand the pressure to get something done, and to do it quickly. We started the examination of this Bill in the hope that we would be able to swiftly approve the new process and commit to ironing out any problems as we go. However, the more we look at it, the more worried we are that this legislation is far too important to be rushed through without proper legislative scrutiny. The Bill is 64 pages long and will undoubtedly become the bedrock legislation for most cases where companies will be rescued in the next five to ten years. Within that context, there are three main areas that worry us. The first problem we have is that the Bill does not appear to be compliant with EU Directive 2019/1023. The purpose of the latter is to implement an alternative to liquidation for companies of all sizes in all European countries which will reduce the current level of liquidations, which is exactly what this Bill is designed to do. The Government has asked for a derogation until 2024 for the implementation of this directive, yet we have here the perfect opportunity to implement legislation which would comply. Why will the Government not make the legislation compliant? It appears to us that the Government has no intention of making this small companies administrative rescue process compliant. It will implement compliance in examinership, giving workers in smaller companies less protection than those in larger companies, even though it is workers in smaller companies who need it more. It would be far safer and more effective to make this Bill compliant now rather than try to amend it later. The second major concern we have is the unholy speed with which the Government is pushing through the Bill. If we were paranoid, we might suspect that the Government is using Covid as a cover for rushing through a Bill which would otherwise be painstakingly examined, line by line, and proper consideration given to amendments. We got first sight of the actual Bill only a week ago, yet the deadline for amendments to the Bill was the day before Second Stage had even started. It is not good practice for us to have a deadline for Committee Stage amendment before the Bill has even been discussed on Second Stage. As important as this Bill is for companies in the context of Covid, this is not a Covid-related Bill at all. It was part of the Company Law Review Group agenda long before Covid-19 even existed. Unlike other Covid-related emergency measures, the Bill, as it stands, is not time-limited. The fact that there is no time limit greatly leads us to fear that, by accident or design, we could end up with flawed, unscrutinised legislation becoming the bedrock of the industrial rescue process for a generation. Our third concern is that this Bill will leave workers less protected than they should be. In the short time available, I submitted three amendments designed to address some of the most obvious flaws, but I feel we have only scratched the surface, which again is the reason we should extend the time to debate or put in place time limits if the Government insists on pushing the Bill through. The Bill, as it stands, fails to protect workers from the cross-class cramdown, unlike similar legislation in New Zealand, where workers are excluded as a protected class of creditor. Under section 558N, any equality claim should be excluded from the court's power to stay proceedings, and under section 558L, unpaid awards for workers should be excluded from write-down without the need for a worker to actively assert that right as a creditor. The voting majorities may need to be changed. We are worried that workers' terms and conditions could be attacked or undermined as part of the defence against onerous contracts, as was threatened recently in a dispute relating to the aviation industry. The workers affected by the terms of this Bill will be mostly under-represented by a union and many of them will not have practical access to exercise their rights and protections because they will not have the legal representation to even know that they can or should enforce them. Without explicit protection as a unique class of creditor and union representation to defend the few rights they have, we fear that workers will be subject to exploitation. In summary, we wish we could join in unqualified support for the Bill. There is no doubt that cheaper access to a rescue plan for smaller companies would be preferable to liquidation, but we remain to be convinced that this Bill is ready and that what may seem to be minor flaws will end up being exploited at the expense of workers. At a very minimum, the Government should extend the period for considering the Bill and make sure that it is subject to proper legislative scrutiny.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as a bheith anseo chun éisteacht linn mar gheall ar an mBille seo. This is good legislation which the Labour Party is happy to support. We need to change the conversation around education in its totality. With that in mind, it is beyond time for us to discuss the establishment of a citizens' assembly on education. Seeing as we hope that we are now coming out of this pandemic and given that many fault lines have been exposed by that pandemic and that many power struggles in the area of education have also been identified, it is now time for us to take an entirely new look at the way in which the education system is structured. This is important if we are to put students and parents at the heart of the discussion on education. We know of the pressure that students brought to bear on the system by demanding to be heard with regard to the leaving certificate. In fairness to the Minister, this campaign was met with a listening Minister. The leaving certificate was only changed to a model based on choice because she was willing to listen and took the students' view on board and treated them with respect. Deputy Foley will not always be the Minister for Education, however. That is why we need legislation to underpin that type of understanding and engagement. When I worked in the education sphere, I was always told to look at everything from the perspective of the child or young person. It is rare enough that the child is at the centre of our debates on education. There are any amount of power brokers and power struggles between vested interests, including representative bodies, patron bodies and the Department. It is rare that the child is at the centre of everything we discuss.  I remember taking this to the extreme and, when the children had gone home, sitting in the very chairs in my classroom in which they sat to see how they viewed the education system and what it was physically like. I wanted to see how far they were from the board, the draughty window or the toilets and whether their space was encroached on by the people beside them. It was really instructive. If one physically places oneself in the place of the children, one's mind is opened to their experience. The whole point of education is not to cater for people like the Minister and me or people working within the system but for those whom we are all trying to serve, the children and young people. Having said that, if the teachers, the SNAs and the school community are not empowered, it is very difficult for them to empower the children in turn. With regard to parents and what has been said about voluntary contributions, I can only agree. The Labour Party tabled a Bill which aimed to abolish voluntary contributions because, as the National Parents Council has said, the relationship between many parents and the school system is financial or transactional. It is based on money. Far too many of the conversations parents have with schools, with teachers and with principals are about money. Parents' associations become fundraising bodies. Parents are asked if they have brought in the voluntary contribution, the book money or the swimming money. Are parents of lesser means then less or more likely to hang around the school gate? Are they less or more likely to respond to that type of communication from the school? Are they less or more likely to go to the parent-teacher meeting if they are going to be reminded about the voluntary contribution, the book money or the swimming money? In fairness to the Minister and her Department, they have begun to roll out a scheme of free schoolbooks in a number of schools throughout the State. That is to be welcomed. That is the type of relationship we want to have between parents and schools because it is fundamentally about children and young people rather than about money. In Northern Ireland, one does not pay for schoolbooks. A cultural shift happens within families if they do not have to spend late August or September worrying about the school book list, getting the money to get the books and whether the school has a book rental scheme. All that is done away with because the State has made a decision, based on values, that children should not have to pay for their schoolbooks and are just given them. The Minister has decided to roll out a pilot scheme. That is to be welcomed. We want to work with her to make sure that the families of all the children in the country do not have to put their hands in their pockets to provide schoolbooks because the relationship between too many parents and the education system is about money.  When it comes to parents' associations, what is the first thing on the agenda but the fundraiser? What is the fundraiser for? It may be to keep the lights on or to keep the school running. There is a fundamental inequality in that because there are only so many schools that can raise a certain amount. There are schools in affluent areas that can raise an awful lot more money than those in disadvantaged areas, which are almost completely dependent on the Minister's Department to pay the bills. There is an inequity in that. In Finland, such things are banned but, of course, in Finland everyone has bought into the idea of funding public services properly through a progressive taxation system. In some modern social democratic countries, people think it is appalling that fundraisers are held for schools. We need to change the mentality in Ireland. It is disgusting that schools are forced to hold fundraisers. We all buy into it, turn up and spend money on the advertisements but it is appalling that schools should need fundraisers to keep them going. Parents then feel their role is to raise money for the school rather than to have proper engagement and a proper empowering discussion about the future of the school and how they can help their children, their children's classes and the entire school community to grow together in a learning environment. It comes down to bloody money. This is progressive legislation and a move in the right direction. The Minister is facilitating the voice of students and parents and that is to be welcomed. However, within the broader discussion we hope to have through a citizens' assembly on education, it must be recognised the financial transactional relationship between parents and schools has to go. The Minister can imagine the humiliation if one does not have the money and one's child comes back from school with a voluntary contribution envelope. What does one say to one's child? It is just humiliating. Education is supposed to be the great leveller, the great enabler and the great liberator. How can one be liberated when it feels that whenever one receives a communication from the school one must be embarrassed because one is being asked for money which, because of one's circumstances, whether temporary or permanent, one just does not have?  It is just wrong but we have got it into our heads that this is what we have to do and that we have to raise funds for the local school. It is wrong and we should make a collective political decision that it is wrong. While it cannot happen immediately, we must move to a position where, culturally and politically, we will have got it into our heads that the school system will be funded to such a degree that schools will not have to hold fundraisers and can actually talk about education. Imagine what a mind-blowing experiment it would be to empower parents to talk about education rather than money. I know what it is like to be the person on the far side of the desk. I know what it is like to be the person sending out reminders about the book money or the swimming money. One would rather talk to the parents about anything other than money. Let us go back to the positive elements for a second because it is not good enough for political representatives and Oireachtas Members to come in here pretending that we have all the answers while the Minister is doing nothing, which is what a lot of political over and back is about. What has the Minister done? She has introduced this legislation. She said she would and she is doing it. What else has she done? She has ensured the student voice is at the heart of the leaving certificate process. Not only was the voice there but it was listened to. The students were saying they needed choice and the Minister delivered that, which is to her credit. She has also said that she is serious about the constitutional convention or citizens' assembly on education. Let us work towards that and have a proper discussion about the nature of funding and about where the power lies, because far too much of it lies with the patron bodies. What else has she done? She has worked with us to ensure that a pilot free books scheme will be rolled out. I believe this has been expanded from 51 schools to twice that number. We are moving towards a meeting of minds.When we pass this legislation, which we hope to table amendments to, to force the agenda around voluntary contributions and this transactional relationship, we need to move into the space of having a citizens' assembly. Government and Opposition can collectively come to a conclusion we have to move beyond the hand-in-the-pocket way of running our school system. The conversation should be about the betterment, empowerment and potential of the child and how parents, teachers and school communities can work together to achieve that. We want to work with the Minister and will do our best to enhance the Bill, but we want to see the citizens' assembly happening as soon as possible.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to make a general point. I cannot accept what the Minister of State has just said in regard to the amendment, namely, regardless of how justifiable it is or how it will enhance the Bill, he is just not going to accept it because he does not have the time. We have concerns about this legislation contradicting European directives, yet his stock answer to all the amendments is that he does not have the time. We were given a deadline for amendments to this legislation as being the day before the Second Stage debate. We often make this charge about things being rushed through but we have never heard a Minister or Minister of State stand in this House and say they are sorry, but they cannot take an amendment regardless of how well-intentioned it is, regardless of the fact their officials agree it might improve the Bill, or regardless of what the Attorney General says, because they just do not have the time. This is quite unprecedented, in my view.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I accept that the Minister of State's function is to try to pass a Bill he believes will do a lot of good for many companies. I accept that is the reason he is here and why he feels so strongly about the legislation. We have no problem with that. I do not think we in the Opposition have a difficulty with that. He said we need to get this done. That phrase is generally that we need to get it done and that we need to get it done right. We believe this is not compliant with EU Directive 2019/1023. While we need to protect businesses, we also need to protect workers in those businesses. Our primary function, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, is as legislators. This sometimes surprises people, especially schoolchildren, when they ask what a Deputy's job is. They think it is about being in the media, delivering leaflets or engaging in local activity. The primary function of a Deputy is in this House, passing and, it is hoped, improving legislation. It is just not good enough to produce important legislation and then to inform Deputies that the deadline for tabling amendments is the day before Second Stage. I appreciate the Minister of State said there will be more comprehensive answers about other amendments. His very first answer is that there is no time. He is right that it is important to get this done, but as Deputy O'Reilly has quite rightly said, it is important to get it done right because rushed legislation is bad legislation in far too many cases and does not protect the people whom we are genuinely trying to help. Nobody is trying to do political theatre or to accuse the Minister of State of not coming from a good place or not having bona fides about enhancing protections in the economic whirlwind that people are going through with the pandemic. At the same time, he has to accept our job is being curtailed by what he is saying as a Minister of State.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 2:In page 16, line 39, after “proceedings” where it secondly occurs to insert the following: “, other than proceedings taken by or on behalf of an employee to the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court,”.The Minister of State will see what we are trying to do in the section on relevant courts powers to stay proceedings or restrain further proceedings is to ensure that those proceedings are not those taken by or on behalf of employees to the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court. While we understand what the Government is trying to achieve with the Bill, with this amendment we are trying to ensure the worker always has recourse regardless of how small the business is. Again, we table these amendments in a constructive fashion because none of us wants to be in a position where people will say to us in six or 12 months' time that we passed a problematic Bill, that workers within this new system we have just legislated and voted for are not protected and how come we did not know that. The amendment addresses that and I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I noticed the word "typical". The Minister of State's reply indicates this situation is not typical but that does not mean this provision will not necessarily be needed. We want it to be explicit within this legislation that workers will still have the opportunity to take these proceedings as they see fit.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 7:In page 31, line 2, after “be” to insert “other than the employees,”.This is a very straightforward amendment which aims to include in the Bill the amended wording:Where a company is a creditor, any person who is duly authorised under the seal of that company to act generally on behalf of that company at meetings of members and creditors may fill in and sign the instrument of proxy on that company’s behalf and appoint himself or herself to be other than the employees, that company’s proxy.I await the Minister of State's response.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was going to say that I will revisit the matter and bring forward an amendment on Report Stage but I will not be in a position to do that. I will revisit it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 8:In page 31, lines 17 and 18, to delete “60 per cent in number representing a majority in value” and substitute “66 and two-thirds per cent in number representing 66 and two-thirds in value”.This amendment is very simple. It aims to increase what is considered to be a majority in the Bill from 60% to 66%. This is two thirds and represents the normal practice.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue here, if we get beyond the sloganeering, is very real. In my community in Marino, there has been a discovery this week about a development on Griffith Avenue. When it was being proposed, there was a lot of internal debate in the community about its size and scale, which was making people uneasy. There was also a lot of sentiment in the local area that development was needed to house our people. We discovered this week that 343 of these units are being sold to a vulture fund. Young people are facing an average rent of €1,914. What are we supposed to do in this situation and how can we prevent it from happening again? When the Minister says, and I genuinely believe he agrees, that this is not something that should happen, how can we prevent it from happening? It is very real; it is happening right on our doorsteps.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know the Tánaiste has referred to this in a previous answer but I ask him when the right to flexible working Bill will be published; the legal protections that are currently in place to support workers who are asked to return to the workplace but who would prefer to remain working remotely; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Within the legislation, is it envisaged there will be a right for workers to switch off? If a person is working remotely, there can be a sense of soft pressure for him or her to remain constantly on, with emails and communications from the employer. I can appreciate this may very well suit the lifestyle of somebody in settled domestic circumstances, with a spare room, an office or whatever, but for a younger worker who may not have that facility, can we within the legislation ensure there will be a responsibility on employers to care for younger workers in particular, who may have only their own bedroom to work from? Will employers be required to provide a certain standard of work station within the space? As the Tánaiste will appreciate, it can be difficult for younger workers to make such demands when they are just starting off in the workplace.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that the legislation is still being drafted and the Tánaiste is still welcoming submissions but I would impress on him the importance of the younger, more vulnerable worker. As I said, there may be soft pressure on younger workers to work from home. If people are 20, 21 or 22 years of age and starting off in the workforce, they would not necessarily have that type of space, if they still live in the family home, to allow them to be as productive as they might like to be, and they might not have the self-confidence to make the case for the company or employer to provide basic provisions to allow for effective working from home. Within the legislation, therefore, the Tánaiste might consider the reality of that younger person, or that person starting off in the workforce, who does not yet have the capability to move out of the family home but needs some basic provision of support from the employer in order that he or she can be effective. It is a reasonable suggestion and it would be relevant to the legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like to ask the Tánaiste if time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment will count towards redundancy entitlements, if he plans to bring forward legislation on this matter, if the suspension of redundancy rights will be lifted at the end of September 2021 and if he will make a statement on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Tánaiste’s response. It is clear that this is something that is on his agenda. He is engaging with the Minister for Social Protection on it. He is due to make a statement on the matter in a number of weeks' time. That is welcome. I note that ICTU has encouraged the Government to reform employment law in order to deal with this issue. The Tánaiste can appreciate that if you were in receipt of the PUP, you were, by Government mandate, taken out of the workplace. We in the Labour Party appreciate that this is a very unusual situation. It is a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Government has been forced to respond and not every response will be perfect. I accept the Tánaiste’s bona fides, and the fact that he is dealing and engaging with the other Department on that. Can the Tánaiste give a more detailed timescale than that? Does he envisage that primary legislation may be necessary?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Tánaiste’s remarks and that the Government is coming from the right place on this. We look forward to seeing the proposals from Government and, hopefully, to being in a position to support the Tánaiste's efforts in this regard.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I sent a message to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education this morning relating to a second-level school in Donaghmede that Deputy Duncan Smith and I visited this morning. The conditions in which the children and staff are working are quite deplorable. I ask the Government to address the issue as soon as it possibly can. I want to raise the issue of the return to school. In our view, there are thousands of children out of school unnecessarily. There are asymptomatic children being kept out of school for 14 days. Is the Tánaiste engaging with the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to re-evaluate the system as it currently stands because the public health teams are not engaging with schools as they did prior to the summer? As the Tánaiste will be aware, the public health team used to connect with the school and make a determination on what should happen next in the case of a Covid case. Now we have a situation where the public health teams are not engaging as well. Principals are left two, three, four or five days without any communication and having to make their own determination.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Now we have upwards of 14,000 children out of the system and that will only get worse.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are trying to find solutions to this. Perhaps we can find a mechanism to ensure it does not get worse.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Nobody should be in any doubt that the reason we are debating this legislation is the catastrophic failure of the Irish financial system due to reckless property speculation and the appalling mismanagement of some of our financial institutions. It is the business of Deputies in Dáil Éireann, as legislators, to create the law, it is the business of the Executive to govern and it is the business of the Judiciary to interpret the law. It is not our job as Deputies to interpret the law or administer justice and it is extremely important that we preserve the independence of the Judiciary. To that end, it is not normal that we discuss an individual judgment or trial as part of the normal business of this House. The fact is, however, that it is impossible to properly explain this Bill without referencing that its primary purpose is to address criticisms by a member of the Judiciary of some of the failures of the Office of Corporate Enforcement following one of the most high-profile failed prosecutions on record, one which was undertaken following the collapse of a financial institution which had been recklessly and foolhardily guaranteed by the State. There is a perception among ordinary people that, collectively, the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary have failed in their duty to ensure that so-called white-collar crime is legislated for, investigated and prosecuted and sentenced passed in a way that is appropriate for the seriousness of the damage caused. To be honest, it is difficult to disagree when we see the many repeated failures of our system to detect, investigate, prosecute and convict those who abuse our financial, corporate and business laws with complete disregard for their victims. Let us be clear who those victims are. When financial crime results in the collapse of a bank or an insurance company, workers are thrown out of their jobs, customers are left high and dry and the State ends up picking up the pieces, we are all the victims. When financial misdeeds force the State to step in and bail out whole industries on the brink of collapse, we are all victims. When people cook the books, cheat taxes and siphon off profits, we are all victims. During the implosion of the property bubble, ordinary workers saw themselves again and again thrown under the bus by the actions of a small few directors and CEOs who saw themselves as above the law. Let us be under no illusions. Corporate crime at the highest level is often difficult to detect, complicated to understand and expensive to properly investigate. Too often, the perpetrators convince themselves that they are bending rather than breaking the rules and their crimes are mere minor misdemeanours - the kind of trifling technicality that still allows one to sit in the Dáil, despite a clear criminal conviction on financial matters, and have a direct phone line to Ministers. We, the people, need a proper agency to tackle this crime and protect us from the social and financial damage to our people. We also need a system which will lead to outcomes and consequences, sentences and punishments which show the people of this Republic that we are serious about tackling corporate crime. The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was established following the Ansbacher scandal of the 1990s and the repeated findings of corruption, bribery and wrongdoing by tribunals which previously led to seemingly minimal consequences for those implicated. While the ODCE had some successes, it has become abundantly clear that it is only scratching the surface of what is required and was unable to deploy and exercise powers and resources to protect our society from the highest levels of business and financial fraud and crime. In 2016, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement returned more than half of its budget unspent. Under this Government, the ODCE had to wait almost a year for the allocation of six detectives it had asked the Garda Commissioner and the Government for in order to do its job. It is no exaggeration to say the collapse of the Celtic tiger case at the heart of the Bill has been held up to almost every Deputy as an example of how the rich and powerful always get away with it. We should not seek to scapegoat individuals or single organisations. As legislators, we need to take responsibility and ensure we do what we can to tackle corporate fraud and do so in a way whereby people are dealt with fairly but the ordinary person in the street has confidence that white-collar criminals who steal, cheat or manipulate people or entities to the tune of millions of euro are subject to consequences appropriate to the scale of their crimes. The main component of the Bill amends the Companies Act to establish a corporate enforcement agency to replace the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE. The Labour Party supports the establishment of this new agency and making it a commission independent of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, we cannot stop there. My fear is that we will set up this under the misapprehension that our work is done only for the next scandal to result in more shaking of heads, an inevitable review and another fruitless exercise in shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. The problem of corporate crime is not just a problem that can be solved by setting up a new agency and walking away. What we need is a complete change in cultural, political and social attitudes. Corporate crime is born of the right-wing attitude that greed is good. Corporate crime is born of the attitude that regulations apply to only ordinary people, that profit for the shareholders is all that matters and that rules are there to be bent. Corporate crime is born of the attitude that company law is there to be exploited rather than obeyed and that paying tax is an imposition to be avoided rather than a valuable contribution to running a better society. I remind Deputies that tax exiles are not heroes. We need a society where business ethics are taken seriously and not just paid lip service. I urge the House to remember that the corporate enforcement agency can be only as effective as the laws we give it to enforce. Unfortunately, the constant refrain of "too much red tape" or "too many regulations" led by some in the private sector and backed by industry lobbyists and some of our politicians is all too pervasive in Irish life and undermines the robust framework of legislation needed to prosecute and punish so-called white-collar crime. Too often we see campaigns to have regulations watered down, undermined or abolished. Unfortunately, there is a culture, particularly on the right, of paying lip service to corporate social responsibility while trying to undermine the proper regulation necessary to protect workers, consumers and honest business people. We see the failure of adequate legislation to deal with the failures relating to mica, pyrite and fire safety in construction and many of the business entities responsible for such scandals disappearing and re-emerging, the principals hiding behind the shelter of corporate laws. As we debate this Bill, we must look at the provisions and ask ourselves whether we are doing enough and whether there is any way we can strengthen the agency and its powers to make sure it has what it needs. As the Bill proceeds through Committee Stage and beyond, we must examine every clause and ask ourselves whether it will help deliver justice. For example, I note that the proposed section 944AF provides that the authority may not impose on a director a monetary sanction that would make him or her bankrupt. It provides that only one monetary sanction may be imposed where more than two breaches of the same conduct have occurred and it re-enacts section 957G of the Companies Act 2014. We might reasonably ask whether in the eyes of the ordinary person such provisions are consistent with how ordinary people are treated. If someone breaks any one of our country's by-laws on parking, road tolls and so on, he or she must pay a fine for each instance. People do not get to say they want to pay only one fine for all the times they break parking rules. I am also concerned that the threat of bankruptcy should not be abused as a mechanism for refusing financial penalties for serious breaches of corporate law, particularly in view of the reform of the bankruptcy laws and procedures. As well as the main section establishing the authority, the Bill provides for the implementation of several recommendations of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, relating to corporate governance, shares and share capital, which hopefully we will be able to welcome as strengthening the protections for citizens. The Bill brings back memories of some of the most painful and appalling travesties in Irish political and financial history. It is ironic that we are here to discuss a Bill of a Fine Gael Minister for Enterprise, Employment and Trade under a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach. I remind the Minister of State that what we are speaking of now is fundamental to the future of our Republic. I taught for a time in the north inner city of Dublin. There used to be media reports of the community in which I served. It was just beside the IFSC. In the 1990s, media reports used to say it should have been the aspiration of young people in the north inner city to get employment in the IFSC. They used to pretend that crime was all in the north inner city, that the paragons of virtue were those wearing suits in the IFSC and that, if those young people could turn away from the parallel economy and the temptation of cheap money and criminal activity and turn their eyes to the IFSC, they might have a better future. All the while, the criminality that almost brought down the Republic was taking place in the IFSC. That is the crux of the matter when speaking to a young person about the choices he or she has - are we equal or are there different laws for people who wear different suits?

These are the 48 names of those who died 40 years ago in the Stardust fire. Hundreds were injured. We do not know the cost in terms of trauma, heartbreak, marriage difficulties, suicide and addiction, but it is huge. I am asking about the cost of what the families are looking for in terms of ensuring the inquiry into the Stardust fire, which cost all these lives and caused all the pain, can finally be set up.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for the reply. Nobody, certainly not me, wants an unseemly political row over what is an intensely traumatic and sensitive issue. The families, however, feel the funding has not been made available to their satisfaction. There is the potential for 47 families not to be involved in the inquest if things continue as they currently stand. While I understand the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, is not the decision maker in this regard, I urge him to ensure that he speaks to the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and ensure this inquest can continue and that we will not have any cloud hanging over it. We all want an inquest to begin and the truth to be found in good faith on all sides. What we do not want is to have a row over money, because money really is irrelevant when you consider the list of people who should still be alive today. All of them were young enough to be alive today. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, to make that case and for this to be resolved.It is the last thing any of the families want to be talking about and I am sure it is the last thing the Minister of State and the officials in the Department want to be talking about in terms of the Stardust fire inquest. They do not want it said that before the inquest began there was a row over money which was not forthcoming from the Department.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his comments. I acknowledge the work put into the Bill by my colleagues, Deputy Bacik, and Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson. We appreciate that the Minister is not opposing the Bill and some of his comments reacting to the Bill are welcome. Some of the commentary made outside this House, however, has been particularly disappointing. My colleagues referred to that earlier.It just makes us all wonder where is the priority of Government. Whom in the housing market is it actually trying to protect? There is no equivalence between the danger that the renter faces and the danger that a landlord faces. I wish the Tánaiste and Taoiseach would realise this. It is a bit like when we have the debates on low pay and workers' rights. My colleague, Deputy Nash, will conclude the debate for the Labour Party and he knows well that whenever we talk about legislation to strengthen workers' rights, somebody always asks, "What about the employer?" We end up with 23% of workers in low pay because resisting giving a worker that right inevitably leads to that worker having less stake in the economy and not having that level of dignity because the legislation always seems to fall down on the employer's side. In response to the comments that the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach made, I say that renters could lose their home. There is no equivalence between the danger of a renter losing his or her home and a landlord losing some money. In Irish history classes as children we are taught about the Land League and the very basic rights it was seeking of fixity of tenure and fair rent. These things are not consigned to the history books. We have history lessons in here all the time from flag-wavers in different parties. They are some of the most basic foundations of the decency that we were hoping to achieve in a republic. There is a sense that renters are some kind of failures who have not got themselves on the property market, their lives are somehow disorganised, they have not made a success of things or they are young and will probably move out at some point. We need to recalibrate and recast our collective brains around the fact that many people will rent for their entire lives. The Tánaiste and Taoiseach saying that we need to be mindful that a landlord might lose some money out of this makes some of us in opposition wonder if they really get it and highlights where the power really is. As Deputies, we have all spoken to people in fear of losing their homes. It is a very real fear. The potential of losing one's home is a terror. That is why I am so proud that Deputy Bacik has stood by her by-election commitment to introduce legislation in this House to protect those rights. We need to collectively rebalance our priorities in this area.  We appreciate that the Minister is not opposing the Bill. Legislation can always be improved and we take that process in good faith. However, it is a commentary on those in senior positions in this Government that when it comes to the suggestion of having absolute protections for renters what jumped into their head first was the profit margins of landlords or the money that landlords might lose out on. This is an issue the entire Government needs to reflect on.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party and I want to work with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education on the issue of back-to-school costs. The Taoiseach will agree that this topic comes up every September and then goes away again. I am concerned that the book publisher, Folens, has now acquired the teacher training institution, Hibernia College. An educational book entity, which exists for commercial interests, is now effectively the largest provider of teachers for the education system. In Northern Ireland, schoolbooks are free; in the Republic, they are not. In fairness, two budgets ago the Taoiseach's Department introduced a scheme to provide 50 schools with free schoolbooks. This was then extended to 100 schools. Working with the Opposition, and with the best of goodwill, we could, for €20 million, which is not a large sum in the overall budget to be presented shortly, provide free schoolbooks for every child in the Republic, just as they are provided in Northern Ireland. Can we take away the conversations about money at the school gates and replace them with conversations about education? The Taoiseach will appreciate that far too many of the conversations teachers and principals have with parents are about money rather than education. I ask him to prioritise that issue in the budgetary cycle.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sorry.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We need a moratorium on evictions and a three-year rent freeze. Last week the Government did not oppose the Labour Party's renters' rights Bill, proposed by Senator Moynihan and Deputy Bacik, but there does not seem to be any enthusiasm to change quickly the Government's policy or the law. We know from statistics that the main reasons for terminating a tenancy are the sale of the property, which accounts for 51% of reasons given, or the use of the home for a relative, which accounts for 24%. Our Bill would restrict evictions for these reasons and ensure families are protected. Will the Taoiseach work with the Opposition to bring forward to fruition and to enact the Labour Party's Bill? Will he commit to a three-year rent freeze?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am delighted to get an opportunity to ask about an issue that falls under the remit of the Taoiseach's Department. The programme for Government includes a commitment to a citizens' assembly on the issue of drugs. As he knows, many people are working on a campaign for the decriminalisation of the drug user. I do not want the word "decriminalisation" in this context to be confused with the idea of decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs. We are talking about the decriminalisation of drug users. The objective is that people who use drugs or have an addiction should not be pushed through the criminal justice system and should be helped, supported and empowered purely through the health system. When is the promised citizens' assembly on drugs, which falls under the Taoiseach's Department, going to happen?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can only assume the Government has learned from what happened in December 2020 when decisions were made which were against public health advice. People may remember that we then had more cases of Covid-19 and more deaths from Covid in January 2021 than we did in all of 2020. I understand where the Government is coming from in this regard. It wants to end restrictions entirely on 22 October, while leaving the legal framework in place until early January 2022 in case anything happens. The Labour Party can understand where the Minister is coming from in this respect. I advise some caution, however. Previous speakers mentioned the great vaccination rate we have, but we also have a level of vaccination hesitancy which must be tackled. I understand that 13% of young people are expressing vaccination hesitancy, with 8% of those aged between 18 and 24 years saying they have no intention of getting vaccinated, while another 5% state they are unsure. A recent survey showed that total of 13% overall. We must, therefore, move beyond this level of complacency. I am not necessarily saying the Minister is complacent but there may be a sense of complacency in wider society in respect of all of us being behind the vaccination drive and that everything is fine on that level. It is not, however. As late as last Saturday, I met a gentleman who proudly told me he was not vaccinated. While we have not had the same type of mass anti-vaccination protests in Ireland as in other European countries, it is an issue. We should not let up in stating why vaccination is important, particularly with regard to that cohort of young people who are more in touch with misinformation online concerning vaccination and campaigning videos and so on in the social media space. This is not something on which the Government or any of us in politics can take a complacent line.  Reflecting on the Minister's words about how far we have travelled, the last 20 months or so have possibly been the most traumatic period in any of our lives. It is having its effect. It is having a long-term effect, not just in the form of long Covid but also in the mental health strain being experienced by many families. Many Deputies will understand that. I spoke to the principal of a school on Thursday who referred to the number of suicide attempts he is encountering and dealing with in his school community. This is replicated throughout the country, with women in particular trying to kill themselves in recent months because of the level of strain and stress they were feeling. Children have been coming across these situations as well. Problematic, difficult and stressful situations in homes were exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19 and the feeling it was not possible to move outside the family space. People cracked as a result. I totally buy into the idea of having a feel-good factor. We are all going to football matches and restaurants again. We are all having coffee inside, meeting family and friends and hugging granny again. However, some people have cracked under the strain and we are still dealing with that.  Turning to my special area of interest, education, we spoke passionately in this House for months about the need for a catch-up fund. The Government delivered to a degree in that regard, but it is going to take years to repair the profound damage done to children, disadvantaged children in particular, in the education sector. Regarding a sector that has opened, the entertainment, restaurant and hospitality sector, we cannot return to the situation where workers in the sector, who are particularly vulnerable, were open to exploitation and receiving low pay. Statistics from the OECD suggest that 23% of Irish workers pre-Covid were on low pay. There is an epidemic of low pay across the very sector that was shut down for so long. We cannot ask those people now going back into the workforce to return to the vulnerability they felt in their workplaces before Covid struck.  We are minded to support what the Minister is doing based on him having learned the lesson from the catastrophic mistake made last year. The biggest criticism the Opposition can make of the Government is that it does not learn. If the Government has learned from the decisions it made last December and is mindful not to repeat them, the Labour Party is minded to support what it is doing. I make the point again that we cannot have any complacency when it comes to the vaccination roll-out. That is particularly the case with young people who are being bombarded with messages from bad actors trying to influence them in a particular way. I remind the Minister of the statistics I spoke of earlier in that regard.  If we are talking about hospitality and encouraging people to go out and meet again, we must examine the vulnerability of people working in those sectors. We must look at the impact of long Covid, as the Minister also identified. We must also be mindful, however, that people in Irish society cracked under the strain of the impact of Covid-19. It is completely legitimate for people to put their hands up and say they did not cope during Covid-19 and just did not make it. We must deal with this issue and fund and resource approaches to addressing it. We must reflect on it and build something much better in future. As Members across the House will know, while many people working in communities and on the front line were dealing with the physical health needs of people in respect of Covid or the restrictive measures within schools or the community, many were also dealing with the mental health strain. That is something we must all deal with collectively in future.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, has put together quite a substantial document which it is hoping the Minister will consider in the budgetary process. I am interested in hearing the Minister's reflections on that budgetary submission and her vision for the future of the arts which, as she will appreciate, has gone through a hellish 20 months.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am delighted to hear that and know they will impress on the Minister the stark findings contained in their report. The latest analysis indicates that two thirds of workers in the sector are earning less than €20,000 per year, 60% of artists and arts workers have neither health insurance nor private pensions, and 74% of performing artists and creative practitioners are reliant on another source of income. The Arts Council reports that 48% of professional artists have considered abandoning their career in the arts over the past year, with lack of income and financial pressures being cited by 70% of them as the main reason. Another stark finding which I am sure the Minister will be discussing tomorrow is that, a decade on from the financial crisis, Government investment in the bodies that underwrite the artistic output of the nation, including the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, Creative Ireland and others, has barely recovered. Ireland continues to languish on the bottom rung in terms of investment in culture in Europe. When does the Minister envisage we can move on from the firefighting and the recovery from disaster of the past 20 months and reach the level of funding that used to be in place prior to the economic crash of ten years ago?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate what the Minister is saying, but the NCFA document argues that it could take until 2024 to recover from the past 20 months in what is already a particularly precarious sector. I am seeking a commitment from the Minister not just to deal with what has happened in the past year and a half but to deal with the long-term situation. It is a source of frustration to the arts community that whenever Ireland is marketed abroad as a tourist destination, the icons put forward from our history are always from the arts community - the poets, musicians and dancers - but funding for the arts has been especially weak.Yes, the Minister has been engaging with the National Campaign for the Arts and that is to her credit, and she is meeting its representatives tomorrow, but it is not just about recovering from the past 20 months. It is about the underlying under-funding issues that have always been prevalent, and a vision to restore that into the future. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister. The Labour Party supports the Bill because at its heart is addressing an issue that should have made everybody in Ireland feel extremely uncomfortable, that is, that a multimillionaire tax exile who owns several radio stations and did not like what certain journalists were writing about him decided to ban entire publications and representatives who work for those publications from speaking on the radio stations he owns. This ban even extended to the sports programmes on those stations. What was at the heart of this was an attack on journalism, free speech and democracy. As was stated, there are many things we have taken for granted, such as the way democracy works, how people carry themselves in public forums, the way the Judiciary works and the way that journalism seeks the truth. Members have seen that in the United States the media have been portrayed as being the enemy of the people. In this country, two journalists have been murdered in the past 25 years. Journalism is at the heart of democracy because journalists seek the truth. All those in political circles have complaints about individual publications, and sometimes about individual journalists, and we sometimes feel that we have been unfairly criticised, but central to our belief system in a republic is that journalism is allowed to do what it is supposed to do. As such, for a radio station that, effectively, gets its licence from the Oireachtas to ban several publications from appearing on any programme on that station is an outrage and the Oireachtas has to react. That is why the Labour Party is in full support of the Bill. The Minister outlined several issues pertaining to the Bill and it is important that she and her Department examine proposed legislation. I accept that if legislation is to be enacted, it must be workable.I also accept the point made by Deputy Cullinane in respect of having Second Stage in 18 months. We have also been on the receiving end of this kind of treatment in respect of Bills that we have brought forward. It almost feels like an attempt on the part of Government to delay. It does not want to be seen to vote the Bill down, so it will elongate the process and hope it will almost go away. It is almost 12 months since I introduced legislation and was told we would come back to in 12 months. It does not feel as if there is the urgency that is needed on this issue. It has been discussed within these Chambers over the past two years. What is to stop another tax exile, or the same tax exile, from acquiring another radio station that currently has a licence from the State and to issue another ban on whatever publication he feels should not be allowed to give its point of view? It could happen tomorrow, yet the Government has said that it could take 18 months for something to be done about it. I wish to make another point on a responsibility that all of us in political life share. I have noticed in the past number of years, and certainly, since the dawn of the social media age, that there have been personalised attacks on journalists from certain political quarters or supporters of certain political entities or movements. They have been trolled and abused and the abuse is often quite misogynistic. Attempts are made to assume that because a person writes for a certain publication, they are from a certain part of the country or they are related to somebody who may be involved in politics, they have a certain point of view. All of us in politics, regardless of our political party, have a responsibility to call that out. It is wrong that somebody engaging in journalism, producing copy, trying to seek the truth and giving what they believe to be a fair analysis of what is happening in these Chambers would be targeted by the supporters of any political entity here - Government, Opposition or otherwise - and be accused of being political, biased, having a political slant, or whatever. We speak regularly in these Chambers about the type of poisonous culture that we sometimes have to deal with in politics. Just as we want to encourage people into politics, we also want to encourage people into journalism and to seek that essential truth. We want to encourage that life and career. It is going to be difficult for someone to be attracted to a career in journalism if, by virtue of where they are from, the fact that a member of their family may have been politically aligned at one point or other or assumptions that can be made about them, that they will be on the receiving end of vicious abuse. We have all seen it and we cannot pretend that it does not happen. All of us have responsibility to ensure that whatever supporters we may have for our political entities online, they behave in a much more responsible fashion. I have seen some quite poisonous attempts made to silence journalists, whose job it is to analyse and report, online in the social media space. The agenda is often to ensure that they will second-guess a comment, a column or a question that they may ask of a political leader. That is wrong and we need to be mindful of that. To be clear about the Labour Party's stance on this issue, it is an attack on democracy for somebody who has deep pockets to own a radio station and to limit those who can come on purely because of the profession that they hold or the publication that they write for. That is an attack on democracy, and Government and the Oireachtas must respond to that attack. It is not good enough to say that we can respond effectively in 18 months because circumstances have changed and this ban is no longer in place. That is not good enough. I remind people that we live in a country where two journalists have been murdered over the past 25 years. The vitriol and poison thrown in the direction of certain journalists has to be called out. It is making some people wonder why they are in the profession. It certainly is making some people second-guess whether they will go into the profession.  Finally, I wish to speak in support of Deputy Cullinane's point about the delaying tactic. Politics works best here often on evenings such as this when Government and Opposition can work constructively together. They do not get much media coverage and people are not necessarily watching in great numbers. However, some of the energy is taken out of constructive politics when a Member brings legislation forward in good faith, and rather than just voting it down or letting it move to Committee Stage and having a thorough investigation of it, the Government kicks it down the road for 12 or 18 months. As a result, the energy, intent and ethic behind the bill is lost. The Minister is just going to have to hope that multimillionaires stay out of the communications sphere and do not introduce more bans on The Irish Times or other publications. That would be a situation that the Minister would regret.  With those comments, we support the Bill and look forward to seeing it enacted, even if it does take 18 months.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party has tabled a priority question on the decriminalisation of drug users for answer on Thursday. The Department of Justice has told us it is a matter for the Department of Health and, as a result, this priority question will not be answered by the Minister for Justice. The reason our courts are full of people with drug addictions is that this is a justice issue. It is dealt with by the Department of Justice and falls under the legislation that the Minister for Justice oversees. If we are to have this conversation about the decriminalisation of drug users, I have to ask the Minister for Justice about it. My priority question on Thursday has been disallowed and I have been told it will be put in front of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in two weeks’ time.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Taoiseach.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We welcome this opportunity to speak to this important report on an area of Irish life which has seen a huge level of public policy failure over many generations and possibly since the foundations of the State. I will speak to some of the key findings and challenges it presents us all with and some of the solutions. The Minister of State has spent some of his allotted time on the report, but there are key findings about lone parents who are significantly affected and of whom less than 25% reported home ownership, compared with 70% of the total population. Ethnic minority groups are at a significantly higher risk of overcrowding. More than 35% of Asian-Irish, 39% of Travellers and 40% of Black-Black Irish live in overcrowded accommodation, compared with 6% of the total population. Some 48% of migrants live in the private rental sector, compared with 9% of those born in Ireland. Some 29% of persons living with a disability experience housing quality issues when compared with the 21% of those without a disability. The continuing problem of homelessness highlights a disadvantaged section of the community for which the most basic measure of adequate housing, as envisaged under international human rights agreements, is not being met. The key challenges which the report outlines are Covid and homelessness. Use of private rental accommodation has been outlined in the previous points, but rents are rising faster than wages. Despite the introduction of rent pressure zones in late 2016, rents have increased by almost 40% in Dublin and 20% elsewhere. Rental costs have risen at a faster rate than mean earnings in Dublin and elsewhere. In 2020, mean monthly rent in Ireland was estimated to be 31% of mean monthly earnings. In terms of what this means and what we need to address, it is a fundamental problem because, in the Irish context, a hugely disproportionate amount of families' and individuals' income is spent on accommodation. It is totally disproportionate to the rest of Europe. Their ability to live good and love- and fun-filled lives is being strangled because they are ploughing all this money into accommodation for their rent or mortgage repayments. We need a national rent freeze. The discussion has been well-articulated in this House and it is not unconstitutional, despite what the Minister of State's colleagues might say. Private renters and those renting from local authorities are at a significantly higher rates of poverty than owner occupiers. This highlights the need for greater protections for tenants and why so many of those entering homelessness are coming from the private rental sector. Inadequate housing and poor housing quality is inevitably associated with higher mortality rates.The figures clearly show that we need to reformulate our approach to housing policies to reflect that there are many people who live alone, many people who never marry, or who are lone parents. We must not keep calculating affordability on the basis of joint incomes. I grew up in an Ireland where it was not unusual for a mortgage to be able to be obtained by a family that had one earner. Clearly, this has led to the current situation, where you cannot effectively get a mortgage unless you are part of a dual income household. It is clearly leading to detrimental outcomes for those who are living alone, both for affordability and housing quality. We have to grapple with that. That is a change in the relatively recent past. We need more disaggregated data, particularly related to nationality and disability, as well as further research in order to ensure accurate representation. There must also be targeted data collection which goes further to ensure adequate representation from certain groups, including the Traveller and Roma communities. There is a strong case for a comprehensive national survey on housing adequacy and affordability. Unfortunately, a person's housing sometimes says more about their status in Irish life than any other facet of their life.  I will re-emphasise this point to the Minister of State. Our dysfunctional housing market and our dysfunctional housing history are making people desperately unhappy. If we did it differently, people in general will be leading much more fulfilling, much more love-filled and much more fun-filled lives. That is on all of us. The model which has been created is just not sustainable for those who want to live.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is there a date for the announcement of the sports capital grants?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State is such a generous guy.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«How long does each of us have?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I hear the point about "year end". I was listening to what Damien Duff had to say on his announcement as manager of Shelbourne FC about the soccer infrastructure in Ireland being horrific. As the Minister of State outlined, every sports club, as well as local authority, is trying to get a slice of this €200 million fund, yet there is a Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from which only one industry benefits, to the tune of about €100 million a year. Every cent on every bet placed in Ireland goes into this one fund that benefits one sport, and the majority of that funding goes to prize money. Is there not a significant imbalance between a major soccer figure saying the soccer infrastructure is horrific and the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund going in its entirety to benefit one sport, with the majority of that going towards prize money and nobody else benefiting, regardless of what the bet is placed on?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a direct correlation between the performance of the national soccer team, which we will, I hope, enjoy tonight, and conversations in houses such as this. There is a direct correlation between the priority a state, parliament or government gives to sport and the performance of the senior international team, regardless of the code. There is a complete imbalance if the levy placed on every bet supports just one industry, to the tune of €100 million a year ring-fenced in legislation, with the majority of that going towards prize money, although I am not suggesting the 20,000 jobs it supports should not be supported. There is a reason that industry is thriving, while sports such as soccer have, as Damien Duff described, infrastructure that is horrific. The Minister of State acknowledged there is an imbalance that needs to be addressed but we need to tease it out further. It is not good enough for us to celebrate sporting achievements without asking the difficult questions in Parliament.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is more to come from the commission’s work, given the case has been broadened to examine the 46 other children who passed through the foster home. We know all too well the history of abuse and neglect in State institutions and this is another shameful part of our history. It is incumbent on any Government to investigate cases of abuse and neglect in State institutions and provide answers for the families of victims. It is clear for all to see the State and State bodies, well into the 1990s, failed their most vulnerable in a catastrophic way. The way in which the mother and baby homes investigation was dealt with by the Government and others served to cause more hurt for victims and their families; this cannot happen in this case. It is disappointing these investigations regularly seem to be prolonged and extended but in this case, that is due to the volume of evidence that has come to light during the investigation. I have no concerns regarding the cost of such investigations because they are vital for victims and their families. It is the responsibility of the State to examine these cases and deliver transparency in respect of the inaction or neglect of State bodies. It is shocking how many State bodies and actors in this case either turned a blind eye, delayed action or did not act for reasons such as seeking legal advice on the case. This led to Grace remaining in the foster home, and I fear for similar cases where this may have happened elsewhere. Empowering People in Care, EPIC, has stated:It has emerged that families of the victims of abuse at the ‘Grace’ case foster home are deeply upset at the “highly confrontational and adversarial” nature of the Farrelly Commission of Investigation. This is deeply disturbing. The welfare of the families of the victims of this investigation must be paramount. It is imperative to the integrity of this and all future investigations that victims, and the families of victims, are treated at all times with respect and sensitivity.EPIC now calls on the Government to ensure that the concerns of these families are listened to, heard and responded to, to ensure that this is not the experience of those other families yet to give evidence.EPIC supports the granting of a 12-month extension to complete phase 1 of the investigation if this will ensure that the full facts of the case are brought to light. In light of the requirement for a 12-month extension to deal with the unanticipated volume of evidence, EPIC also calls on the government to carry out a review of resources to ensure that the investigation has the capacity to complete this and future investigations within agreed timelines.Where the State has clearly failed in the past, it must ensure that all families are heard and receive appropriate communications from the commission and that the State does not add further pain by continuing the bad communication and inaction which have led us to this point. Despite the criminal convictions and allegations of sexual abuse, the State did not act. It should have acted promptly to ensure the protection and safety of a child, and then an adult, who was vulnerable. It will be difficult for members of the public listening to or reading about the details of this case to understand how correspondence could be exchanged between Mr. X and relevant Ministers regarding a case and then for no action to have subsequently been taken, when correspondence would indicate otherwise.  I accept the commission's findings that neither Minister made personal interventions in this case and that the remit of responsibility lies with what was then the South-Eastern Health Board. These interactions, however, speak to the systemic levels of inaction that occurred in this case, notwithstanding that it was positive that no Ministers intervened beyond their remit in this instance. The case shows us that the concurrent lack of clarity with the legal status of a vulnerable person only produced more difficulty. We have seen from so many of the wrongs of the past that the most vulnerable were left without support and that the State and its entities failed in their duty to protect, shelter and protect vulnerable people, such as Grace. It is unacceptable that the role and legal status of Mr. and Mrs. X and Grace's mother in regard to decision-making for Grace was allowed to be misconstrued. The State and its authorities should have provided legal certainty and acted promptly when any misconceptions arose. One of the most troubling aspects of the case is that there was a complete failure to gain legal clarity from the State authorities involved to ensure that decision-making on behalf of Grace was carried out appropriately. When dealing with cases such as these, it is paramount that State bodies and actors involved in such scenarios act in unison with other State bodies in respect of actions or work carried out concerning the protection of a vulnerable adult. The recurring neglect to make a definitive decision and to act in the full possession of all information relating to a case is simply unacceptable. For so many State bodies and arms of the State involved in cases such as this, this represents a complete and systematic failure of those of State bodies tasked with care and protection. It would not be unjust for an independent onlooker reading this review to conclude that because of the difficulties presented in the case of Grace that numerous people within State bodies, and those State bodies themselves, swept this problem under the rug or away from view and that this inaction and indecision in turn only led to further neglect in the support and protection of a vulnerable person. One line in the second substantive report really exposes the blatant neglect in this case. The fact that a decision to seek legal advice, including on wardship in Grace's case, was always seen as a last resort rather than a first priority bears emphasis. This is an appalling failure and it would lead us to believe that those responsible never intended to seek clarity in the case or to ensure that Grace was in an adequate setting, with adequate care and protection. I remind this House of the words spoken during the meeting of the First Dáil by Tom Johnson, who said: "It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children [...]". The Democratic Programme was the founding document of this Republic, and it has been violated by what happened in this case.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and for the Government not opposing our Bill. I congratulate my colleagues, Deputies Duncan Smith and Ivana Bacik, on bringing forward this legislation. All of us in this House are possibly haunted by the fact that in 20 or 30 years’ time younger members of our family may be asking us what on earth we did when we had the chance to do something. That is why it is all our responsibility to do something. Any of us who think we can radically address this existential crisis without it involving any pain for anybody is fooling themselves. It shows zero political leadership for any political entity or grouping to suggest we can all live our lives as we have in the past and address this issue; we cannot. Mary Robinson stated at COP26:COP26 has made progress but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are in crisis not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty. Leaders have extended by a year this window of opportunity to avert the worse of the climate crisis. The world currently needs them to step up more decisively next year.What she said on national radio this week really stopped me in my tracks. She said anyone under the age of 60 in our world is likely to have a world that is less liveable in, which is facing terrible fires, floods and droughts and millions of people having to leave their homes. Anybody under the age of 30 is sure to live in that world, and that is what we are talking about. I am mindful of some of the very hot and heavy contributions that have been made to debates like this one in this Oireachtas and particularly this Dáil. Those who tend to make these hot and heavy contributions, and who accuse those of us who are trying to address climate change of driving a wedge between urban and rural Ireland, should ask themselves how many people in their families are under the age of 30 and what they will say to those family members in 30 years’ time. This is not about urban or rural Ireland; it is about all of us making an effective change and changing the ways in which we have been living. We can make positive changes to the way we live by trying to understand what the carbon impact is of buying one product or service over another, which is what our Bill seeks to achieve. It can be difficult to see beyond the massive greenwashing of companies that are trying to tap into an increased appetite for change and at the same time hide or obscure the actual level of carbon which contributes to any product or service. We in the Labour Party are justifiably sceptical of any corporate entity which looks at the massive mobilisation of young people and wonders how it can tap into that consciousness and their ethic in order to make money. In a shop or online, it should be easy to identify which of two products or services has a greater impact on global warming. This Bill seeks to put in place an independent and transparent carbon labelling system for all corporations. In the same way that people have nutritional data to manage their health, we need to provide clear carbon data in order that people can manage their climate impact. It also creates a clear way of comparing which companies are serious about working towards a liveable, sustainable future and those who are not. At present, customers still have no way to compare how companies are doing on their climate credentials. This leaves them open to misleading claims and confusing messages designed to persuade us that corporations are pulling their weight when many are not. I often think of the phrase "recyclable versus recycled".  In early 2020, Ryanair made a claim that it was the UK's lowest emission airline. The statistics it used were completely misleading based on data from 2011 and left out many of its leading competitors. There is no way big corporations like Ryanair will magically publish accurate and independent measures of unflattering climate change data. At present, so-called green measures are more likely driven by marketing departments trying to tap into ethical consumer dollars. Companies that are making genuine strides to be low-carbon suppliers find it genuinely hard to differentiate themselves against the claims and counter-claims from their less scrupulous competitors. As spokesperson on enterprise and employment for the Labour Party, it is essential we reward those companies which are doing things right by giving them an independent, transparent and standardised mechanism for showing their customers they are working to help to save us all. Businesses which are paying marketing lip service can be forced to publish their carbon sums in order that they can be monitored, tested and interrogated. We need honest data and information to allow us to publicly support those who are on the side of the fight against climate change and to abandon those who are not pulling their weight.  This Bill is not a magic bullet. We do not pretend that it is. The State will have to go way beyond labelling in managing a just transition to a liveable future but this Bill sets out a straightforward mechanism for the Government to let us start, at least, to monitor and measure the carbon impact of everyday choices in living our lives. I hope this Bill will be supported by all parties as a positive step towards the change that we need. There is no doubt there are a thousand different areas where we need to take action. This Bill is a small but nonetheless essential component in allowing people to make positive climate choices when they spend their money. We think climate change is too important to play games with. Representatives from all parties and groupings in this Oireachtas should work to support each other and help to lead our people into a just transition to a more sustainable future. Often the struggle within parties will be as important as those between parties. The Labour Party is particularly aware of the work of Labour Youth in championing action on climate change as a core Labour Party value. I would ask those young people who are supporters of other political parties to exert all the pressure they can on their own political movements to ensure the vast majority of this Dáil is united in doing what needs to be done. We need to support those in government or in opposition when they take principled stances to support climate measures. We need to reach across party lines to help each other in the political world to make the right choices. If those of us who are serious on this issue could work together in opposition and in government to do the right thing always and not just oppose taxes or painful choices to cause difficulty for the Government, then we in Ireland can become leaders, not laggards, in international climate action.This Bill is a step towards that process. In ten, 15, 20 or 30 years, I want to be able to say I did everything in my power to make the changes we needed when the call was made. Supporting this Bill and acting on the outcomes is a small part of that commitment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The teachers.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement to the House. As others have said, it will take some time for us to go through. As Deputy Conway-Walsh has said, we are all united as an Oireachtas in our grief for the loss of these brave public servants. I know for the families it is not a case of ever getting over such a loss but I suppose it is pain that they must, in some way, try to get used to. I am minded to read into the record the statement by IALPA in response to the report, as the Minister should take cognisance of its views. It states:Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, Winch Operator Paul Ormsby, and Winchman Ciaran Smith lost their lives while participating in a rescue off the Mayo coast. This report shows that the loss of their lives was as needless as it was preventable. It is evident from media reporting that the final publication of the report corresponds with the AAIU interim and preliminary reports and makes it clear that the crew of R116 were exemplary in the performance of their assigned task. Their planning, response, teamwork and communication was exactly what would be expected from such a competent and seasoned crew on a flight led by such professional pilots. They were let down by a regulatory system which left them ill-equipped to do the vital work that same system tasked them with. The report outlines a number of regulatory and systemic issues which conspired to put the crew in lethal danger. Prime amongst them was the provision of inaccurate and misleading chart and map data. All flight crew rely on the basic assumption that their maps and charts provide accurate data. Few flight crews could be more reliant on that assumption of accurate data than the crew of a rescue helicopter operating offshore in challenging conditions outside their normal home base, scrambled at short notice to launch a rescue in the middle of the night (00:45 am). They relied on the data production standards of Irish regulation to guarantee them correct information. They were let down. IALPA President Evan Cullen described it as a fundamental betrayal: "As an airline pilot, if I take a flight from Dublin to Rome, I must navigate the Alps, and I expect one of two things from the Swiss authorities; tell me the height of the alps, or tell me they don’t know the heights, so I had better avoid them. The one thing they cannot do, under any circumstances, ever, is tell me the wrong height or tell me the Alps are not there. In essence that is what the Irish State did to Dara, Mark, Paul and Ciaran. They approved information which said, 'you are safe', when the absolute opposite was the truth." The report details failures in oversight, equipment requirements and maintenance and in resourcing for search and rescue. But it is the regulatory failure by the now defunct Irish Aviation Authority which is central to this accident. They set the standards for equipment, for mapping and for oversight. They accepted standards which most, if not all, of their European peer authorities would not. This tragic and unnecessary loss of life must not be allowed to happen again.All of us in the House can agree with that same very basic sentiment. It is the point of this debate and the report we are discussing this evening. I know the Minister shares that view. The statement finishes with a call supported by the Labour Party:IALPA is calling on the Government and Minister for Transport to institute an immediate review of the failures identified in this report and to bring forward concrete proposals to address each and every identified failure immediately. It is to the Minister's credit that he gave this House a very detailed statement that will take time for us to dissect and understand better. I was determined this evening to put the voice of airline pilots on the record of the House to ensure we never have to debate another tragedy of the nature and magnitude of what happened to the four brave people who lost their lives aboard R116.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party is determined to work with the Government to ensure that our schools remain open. We know, as the Government knows, how profoundly damaging it was for children and young people when our schools were closed, particularly those children and young people who are disadvantaged and those who have additional needs. I know that the Minister agrees with me on that, but he will have to accept that there is a huge amount of confusion and lack of leadership. School communities and principals are contacting every Deputy in this House about that level of confusion. They are saying daily that the system is at the brink of collapse. I spoke to a principal in the mid-west today who told me that he had a close contact issue with a member of staff, he contacted the helpline, as he is required to do, and he was told that the advice issued on Tuesday, even though it is on the website, is not yet active. That situation has changed between this morning and this afternoon. As the Minister will appreciate, there is a huge amount of confusion. Yesterday, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, was on the radio telling the country that antigen tests will be rolled out in schools by the end of this week. This morning, The Irish Times reported that it will be the week after next, which is December. In April, the Government was told by the expert group chaired by Professor Mark Ferguson that antigen testing should be rolled out in primary and post-primary schools. The Minister, Deputy Foley, had the audacity to accuse me of being disingenuous. Professor Orla Hegarty of UCD said it would cost €12 million to have air purifiers installed in every classroom in the State. These are practical suggestions that the Labour Party has for the Government. Yesterday, we raised with the Taoiseach if it is not reasonable, when justifiably it is the focus of Government to keep all of our schools open, that once those who are most vulnerable have been vaccinated, we would prioritise those working in our school sector, including teachers, SNAs and school principals, for booster vaccines. Is it not reasonable at this point to stop all of the unnecessary inspections in our schools given so many school leaders are dealing with nothing else but Covid? Will the Government please stop coming out with the mantra that schools are safe? It is completely reasonable for Government to say that schools are no safer than any other working environment, but that it is really important that we keep them open. When the Government comes out with the one-liner that schools are safe, school communities do not think it is in touch with what they are experiencing day-to-day.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We appreciate the Minister's engagement, but he will appreciate that if the school system collapses and schools have to close, which we absolutely do not want to happen, society will not be able to function. That would be profoundly damaging for children and young people, but society will not be able to function. If schools have to close, a lot of questions will be asked about the leaving certificate. None of us wants to return to that cycle of last January and February in terms of the level of anxiety in Irish society. The Minister answered my question on antigen testing. I might not like his answer, but he answered it. He has also given me an answer on booster vaccines. I impress on him again that if the school system is that important to the Government, as I believe it is, surely the focus should be on keeping our SNAs and our teachers and our school communities functioning and our school system open. Even as a gesture of solidarity with that sector, who are listening to the "schools are safe" mantra from the Government which grates on them, a prioritisation of our school sector - the Labour Party will be unpopular for suggesting it because other front-line workers will suggest they are more deserving - if we feel education is that important, as we do, and a reassessment of the booster roll-out for those front-line workers in our education system is something the Government should reconsider.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I believe it is at the Green Party's insistence that there is a plan for a citizens' assembly on drugs in the lifetime of this Government. CityWide, the drug project and lobby group said earlier today at its conference that there has been a 225% increase in the number of drug deaths in Ireland over the past 25 years. We have the fourth-highest overdose rate in Europe. I know it is important to the Minister, his party and every political party in this House that we have a new approach to drug policy. There is a citizens’ assembly in the programme for Government. We in the Labour Party want to work with goodwill to establish that citizens’ assembly. Can the Minister commit to a time that citizens’ assembly will meet? It is crucial that we deal with the issue of drug deaths, and with the pain and suffering that has been caused by the drug industry in Ireland so that we can together find a new approach.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have raised this issue with the Minister before. There is a crisis for many families. I do not use that word lightly. It is not just an issue in north Dublin. Many of my colleagues across different constituencies in Dublin, Wexford and in Drogheda tell me the same thing. Colleagues of mine, John Nisbet, in Dublin North-West, Senator Marie Sherlock in Dublin North-Central, Deputy Duncan Smith in Dublin Fingal, and people in my constituency, Dublin Bay North, are talking about it. My colleague, Senator Mark Wall, from Kildare, raised it in the Seanad yesterday. There is a crisis with access to second level school places. Primary level is an issue too. We have discussed the provisions in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 for 25% of places to be kept aside for children or grandchildren of past pupils. That has now gone to Committee Stage in the Oireachtas education committee and we can discuss that. It has been suggested to me that the level of social mobility around the time of the housing crash 12 or 13 years ago is part of the issue here because many families moved into areas they were not originally from. Their children are now reaching second level school age and so this problem is arising. For whatever reason, my office has never had the level of contact we have had in recent months about issues of accessing second level schools across the northside. These children have to be taught and to go to second level. We are now at a stage where panic is creeping in. The Minister can appreciate that being in primary school for the past years has been difficult with the pandemic. Young people want the security of knowing what secondary schools they will attend. Parents want to know too. It is becoming an acute problem in my constituency. Unfortunately, I do not have answers for these parents who contact my office. I suggest they go through the enrolment policy of the school and try to engage with the school in whatever way they can, but they tell me they are on different waiting lists for different schools. I am also told there can sometimes be a general data protection regulation, GDPR, issue with sharing data about who is on which list. A number of parents may have their children on a number of different lists. It is not always obvious how many places are necessary for a cohort of young people. There is a parallel issue with the choice of patronage. If people have been educated through Irish until sixth class and would therefore choose an Irish-language medium second level school, that has its own challenges. If people have been taught with the Educate Together ethos until sixth class, they will prefer that type of schooling. Either way, my constituents face the crisis of not having any notion of where their children will go for first year of secondary school next year. What analysis has the Department done of this issue in north Dublin or farther afield, in areas I have referred to? What measures is it putting in place to address it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her reply. I appreciate she and the Department recognise there is an issue. We often raise issues in this House and get the sense from the Department or the Minister that this is not really a concern. I can tell from the Minister's response and previous responses that she acknowledges there is an issue.There is a push locally for a new Educate Together second level school in that catchment area, which could cater for a number of primary schools of that ethos. That would benefit the area and also release some of the pressure. I note that some of the schools mentioned by the Minister have additional accommodation projects. At what point will the Minister be able to respond to me as to the nature of the intensive work the Department is undertaking and at what point will she be able to share with local Deputies the outcome of that work to ensure that we can then tell all of the constituents who contact us that there will be adequate places for their children in September? As the Minister will appreciate, this is not something that anybody can take lightly. If there is insecurity or uncertainty in a family in regard to where a young person will be attending school in September, particularly if that child is the oldest child at school, one can appreciate the anxiety that creates. If it has not been resolved by this stage, it is going to dominate issues over Christmas and into the new year, etc. While I appreciate the Minister is acknowledging the issue, can I get an assurance from her that the Department will liaise with local Deputies and representatives in the Dublin Bay North area as to the results of this intensive work being done by the Department so that we can then relay that information to our constituents who are making contact with us?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate Deputy Gannon and the Social Democrats on bringing forward this Bill. It is quite ironic that the Government thinks that, if we even talk about sex, something new will be born in nine months' time. That is the reason for the delay in moving on to Committee Stage, which would be the obvious step to take if the Government was taking this legislation seriously. It is remarkable that we even need to have this discussion. It is sometimes almost embarrassing to discuss the Irish education system with somebody who is not Irish. If I was to explain to somebody from overseas who is not Irish why we need to have this discussion about sex education in our State-funded schools, I would find myself getting embarrassed and struggling to convince that person that we live in a genuine republic. The words "republic" and "republican" are bounced around these walls and around the airwaves all the time but when it comes to basic State provisions such as education, which is supposed to free minds, the system is anything but republican. If talking to someone from outside who is not Irish, I would have to say the reason we need to have this conversation about providing for proper sex education and empowerment in our schools is that a great many of them are under religious influence. What the Minister did not speak to in her contribution when she was telling us about the need for a nine-month delay is the supplementary providers who come into the system. These are often encouraged by patron bodies that believe that sex outside of marriage, contraception, abortion and IVF are wrong, that marriage should only be between a man and a woman and that homosexuality is disordered. These supplement the scheme the Minister spoke to with their own ethos and in their own way. They also do not believe that men and women are equal. Again, if talking to a person from outside Ireland, I would have to say that the reality on the ground in our schools is that we need this legislation to ensure we do not have these supplementary providers coming in to push an agenda based on an ideology because we do not have the courage of our convictions, as a republican assembly, to establish a State education system with a State sexual health education programme. By the way, one third of our second level schools are single-gender schools. We love separating children on the basis of religion and gender. We also enjoy separating them on the basis of income. The point here is that this is not just about whatever scheme is mandated by the Department. It is about what the patron bodies do to supplement that scheme. That is the point of the exercise. That is the point of the legislation. One would think that at this point in the journey of this republic, we would all have come to the conclusion that we need to separate church and State. Why is that such a controversial thing to say? Why do people get nervous about the letters and emails that will come when anybody in politics says that we need to separate church and State? Why is it so outrageous to say that we need to separate church and State, that the incredible influence these unelected and ideological bodies have over young minds in this country must be broken, that the State has to take responsibility for education and health and that we need to have a discussion about how we cannot stand over that system any more because it is not doing any good for our children? I maintain that it is actually doing damage to them because it does not, in any way, reflect their lives. They hear that divorce and IVF are wrong and that, if they have a brother who is gay, he is disordered. They are told that the family they grew up in is not ideal. In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to establish a citizens' assembly on education. I am blue in the face, as is Deputy Gannon, from asking about the citizens' assembly on drugs but I will ask the Minister about the citizens' assembly on education. We need to finally come down to the constitutional reality that we cannot stand over that system any more. If a citizen's assembly is required to ask these hard constitutional questions, then let us put those questions to the people. As has been said, whenever we have asked the people about the tough constitutional issues that we never thought could be resolved, they have been well ahead of us. They are moving in their droves away from this old, tired view of an Ireland that is disproportionately influenced by men over a certain age who have certain titles and demand that we live in a way that is - I should say "was always" - out of sync with any sort of reality. That Ireland is over. I had to correct myself there as I suggested this is a modern reality. It is an eternal reality. I ask the Minister to please speak to the fact that this is not just about what is mandated in schools but about what schools can do to supplement that. As Minister of State in the area of equality, I had difficulty in trying to get section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 repealed so that schools could not discriminate against teachers on the basis of their marital status or the fact that they were gay or unmarried parents. However, I could not delete that section because of constitutional impediments. It could only be amended. I remember that. I also remember teachers who were members of the Irish National Teachers Organisation LGBT group going up to Áras an Uachtaráin, where they were encouraged to get into a photograph with President Higgins but stood aside because they believed their employment prospects would be at risk. That is not ancient history. I have made a few points to the Minister in the time allotted to me. I very much appreciate this initiative by the Social Democrats. I urge the Minister to stop talking about what is being mandated and to talk about how these patron bodies are supplementing that. When are we going to have this citizens' assembly on education? Will the Minister please have the vision and conviction to speak as a politician in a republic about the need to finally separate church and State?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Only 7% of the adult population of Ireland remains unvaccinated but that accounts for approximately 55% of those who are in ICU. In a discussion that Opposition spokespeople had yesterday with the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, some of the statistics that were given to us and related to unvaccinated young people were quite stark. Particularly in the age group between 25 and 29, only 80% of that age group is vaccinated. We do not want to get into the realm of shaming young people. We want to encourage young people to get vaccinated. I ask the Taoiseach what sort of public advertising campaign of encouragement will the Government invest in and roll out to ensure that younger people take up vaccination because they are the ones who are more mobile, are meeting more people and are part of the solution.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is fair to say that school communities around Ireland are this morning grappling with another chaotic management of messaging and leadership from the Department of Education. The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I are in absolute agreement that it is incredibly important that schools remain open. It is profoundly damaging for children when schools are closed. We know that when they were closed it was very difficult for students, particularly those in disadvantaged areas and those with additional needs, to get the type of educational services they needed. For the past 18 months, the Department and the Government have been saying, "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe". Last month, I stood here and asked the Minister and the Government to stop saying that, but they continue to repeat that schools are safe. Last week, we heard a new line from NPHET, that is, that it never said that schools are safe. Having taken five days to consider what NPHET has suggested in terms of mask-wearing for nine-year-olds, from third class upwards in primary schools, we get an overnight diktat from the Department of Education, delivered with all of the subtlety and compassion of a gas bill. This morning, principals have to police mask-wearing by nine-year-olds, from third class upwards, without any sense of what the legal implications are if a parent was to refuse, no sense of a lead-in period and an absolute absence of commentary, guidance or leadership from the Minister.  All we needed last night was a video message or other communication from the political leader of education in Ireland acknowledging that this change is difficult, telling parents that they are part of the solution and asking them to talk to their children about wearing masks - children have seen adults wearing masks - and telling them that the reason for that is we are trying to make sure that people do not get sick, that they can help us in that regard, that they should not feel anxious or worried, that we will get through this together and that they are part of the solution. Instead, we got a classic, soulless communication, a follow-up to a communication from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, and NPHET to each individual school stating that this change was required to come into effect today. After everything schools have been through, the Minister being asked last April to do something around antigen testing, but doing nothing about it until this week, all of the failures of communication heretofore and the Minister and Government parroting the line, "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe", they have given principals and school communities 16 hours to get their act together to enforce a diktat, a requirement from the Department of Education on face mask wearing among, potentially, very anxious children, with zero compassion and zero leadership from that Department.  The Government has been described as a bad debs committee. That is the best description I can come up with this morning. I would like the Minister to respond to that and to speak not just to me, but to take this opportunity to speak to the children of Ireland who may see this contribution later today. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister cannot stand here and tell us it is a public health measure and that is just the way it goes. She has said a practical approach is expected over the next day or two. What kind of leadership is that? What kind of certainty is that? What legal basis is there for this? What happens if somebody comes to the school gate and refuses for their child to wear a mask? What does the principal do then? Does the Minister know what principals should do in such circumstances, and has she informed them of this in the 16 hours given for them to prepare for this measure?  We all know we are trying to protect people from getting sick, hospitalised and ending up in ICU. We know what the point is. Government Members were the ones telling us for the last 18 months that schools were safe while school communities, principals and managers were screaming out for support. I think the Department is depending on the goodwill of principals, who are hardwired to ensure they defend the reputation of their schools at all costs in the school community, to ensure there are not high anxiety levels among their student body or parent body and to keep the show on the road, rather than telling the truth of what is happening. The Department expects a practical approach over the next day or two. There is no understanding of legal implications, no reference to the potential for HEPA filters to be put in schools and no understanding of the heating bills that schools are facing. There was no leadership from the Minister last night. Please do not throw it back at us and say we are somehow not adhering to public health advice when the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was sketchy on that last night. Will the Minister, Deputy Foley, take the opportunity to show some leadership and give some guidance to schools, school communities and principals who are doing their best to deal with anxious children, who the Minister has let down in this regard? What they needed last night was a voice of compassion, care and leadership from the political face of education in Ireland.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«You did not say that last week.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«And leadership.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Do not give us that line. We have all worked in schools.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The word "requirement" was used. That is not flexibility.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«For the love of God. If I hear that accusation one more time-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am beginning to think that the new phrase in political circles, which is not opposing the Bill, feels a bit like you can go and talk to the cat because it has pretty much the same effect. The frustration we have on the Opposition benches is we have spent the past 18 months trying to bring forward practical solutions to benefit workers and people in society and to fill the gaps and fault lines that Covid has exposed. I am talking of basic protections for workers and young workers who have been asked to work from home and the protections they need. Sick pay is a basic provision in almost every other European country, yet we still struggle to grapple with such pay. I believe the Government's recommendation is that 7% of a person's wages would be covered by sick pay, which for a minimum wage worker would not even cover on a daily basis the price of going to a GP to get a certificate. Now we have this recommendation in terms of legislation from the Opposition. Again, it is a basic provision in the fight against Covid. Schools have been mentioned and we had a debate with the Minister for Education this morning as to why people like Professor Orla Hegarty are not being listened to when she says it would cost €12 million to install a HEPA filter in every primary school class in the country. Yet, when it comes to Government, it seems as if, when it gets advice or a recommendation from the Opposition, it has to deal with it with a mindset of scorn and not being open-minded enough to work on this together. When we asked about antigen testing and when Professor Mark Ferguson said last May that it should be introduced in primary and second level schools, the Government sat on it for six months. Meanwhile the Government has repeatedly told us schools are safe until NPHET told us last week it never said that in the first place. Then the Government gave schools 16 hours to implement a mask-wearing measure for third class and up. Meanwhile, as my colleague has said, children are sitting in classrooms wearing coats, scarves, hats and gloves with the windows open and what Professor Orla Hegarty is saying seems to be irrelevant. When practical and goodwill legislation is brought in to protect workers, we get the not opposed line from Government, which has the same legal basis as saying you can talk to the cat. What we are trying to bring forward here is a practical suggestion from the Opposition as to what is actually happening on the ground because we want to be part of the solution.We want to drive leadership in our own communities. We want to assure everybody that there is hope, that we can get through this and that things are not disimproving out of control. That is the level of anxiety every public representative must deal with day to day. What the Government sometimes throws back at us is that we are not putting on the green jersey or we are not part of the same team. That is deeply insulting to those of us who are dealing on a day-to-day basis with people who are losing hope, who are cracking up and who are now facing into what they think is going to be a very difficult December, Christmastime and January. This is particularly so as yesterday the Taoiseach was again very unwise in his words on school opening in January. Meanwhile, basic supports such as the EWSS and the PUP are being cut. I ask the Minister of State to take advice from the Opposition in good faith, to stop using this line about not opposing and to embrace what we are trying to achieve here to protect workers in their workplaces.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I tried to put this question concerning the decriminalisation of drug users to the Minister for Justice, but it was redirected to the Department of Health, which I am sure will be of interest to those who have criminal convictions for possession of controlled substances for personal use. I will be interested to know the Department of Health's view of the potential for the decriminalisation of the drug user.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are several issues with the response from the Minister of State. The use of language in this debate is extremely important. I referred to the decriminalisation of the "drug user", while the response from the Minister of State refers to the "decriminalisation of drugs" and continues with a reference to the legalisation of drugs. Decriminalisation and legalisation are completely different issues, as are decriminalisation of the drug user and decriminalisation of drugs. I am talking about the person, and the decriminalisation of the person. If the Minister of State had come in here at the beginning of the pandemic and said that the solution to Covid-19 was to arrest everyone who gets it, everybody would have thought she was out of her mind. People at the start of the pandemic would have regarded people working on the front line or living in poor conditions, for example, as victims of this virus, not as people who should be penalised by the State. It would be a ridiculous response from the State to arrest people because they have Covid-19, but that is exactly what the State does in respect of people with addiction issues. We arrest them for possession of something they are addicted to. It does not work. We have the fourth highest overdose rate in Europe. People are dying and the response-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----must be much more compassionate than misinformed answers on the floor of this House.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sorry. The Minister of State's proposal is that people will get a criminal sanction if they are caught a third time. What is the difference? If someone is acutely and profoundly addicted to something, surely the hundredth time that he or she has an intervention because of that addiction should have the same response as the third time. What is utterly heartbreaking about this is that the people affected are powerless. If they had more power and more value in society, we would not be treating them like this and they would not be ending up in graveyards at the rate they are. It is because they are disproportionately poor that they are treated by the State in this fashion. I suggest to the Minister of State that the proposal for a citizens' assembly on drugs be fast-tracked, she put to one side her current proposal on how to deal with people in addiction and look instead to the Portuguese model, which is much more humane and has successfully reduced the number of people in addiction programmes by 50%. Crucially, it has also reduced the number of people dying from overdoses by 75%.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have the fourth highest overdose rate in Europe. The Minister of State should please understand the difference between decriminalisation of drugs and decriminalisation of the drug user.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They are completely different things, and the Minister of State needs to understand that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want respect for those dying as a result of this issue. I also want a citizens' assembly on drugs.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is that the response? This over and back and "Why did you not do it"?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Where is the citizens' assembly?It is in the programme for Government. Is that the Minister's response?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party supports the motion tabled by Deputy Paul Donnelly and we congratulate him on the work he has put into it. I do not think anyone could grow up in Dublin, particularly on the northside, without the issue of Stardust looming large whenever the fire brigade or firefighters are mentioned. It is a scar across the northside. It happened 40 years ago but it is something that runs extremely deep. That is why, when we had a presentation from SIPTU and firefighters a number of weeks ago about this matter, I could almost see myself sitting in an Oireachtas committee after some disaster in the future listening to testimony about how we were completely unprepared. Having visited Kilbarrack fire station in my constituency and having listened to firefighters there saying they have no capacity to deal with any fire that takes place over the sixth storey in any apartment block, it is clear that these people are putting their lives on the line for something they believe in, which is protecting life and public safety, but they are not given the tools to do the job properly. It takes a huge amount for somebody to ballot for industrial action. It is the biggest thing a worker can ever do. I sometimes wonder if people who do not understand the trade union movement or the labour movement think balloting for industrial action is a frivolous thing that people do without thinking. It is the biggest thing a worker can ever do. There is no selfish motive behind this. It is not about pay or conditions. This is about the potential for the service to actually do its job. We were all told to stay home today. Schoolchildren were told not to go to school. Childcare facilities and third level institutions were closed and will still be closed in many areas around the country tomorrow but our firefighter personnel are still expected to go out and effectively put their lives on the line to protect us. They put on that uniform and believe in it but the feeling from them is that the State, or the authorities in Dublin who oversee the fire brigade, do not believe in that uniform as much as they do. I appreciate that this motion is not being opposed. That is a positive move and much of what the Minister said is to be commended. However, I was absolutely shook by the testimony given to me and others when Senator Marie Sherlock organised that briefing for us. I felt that we were potentially looking at a situation like what happened in the UK when a major fire incident took place. Lives were lost and destroyed, bodies were maimed, children's lives were torn apart and children's parents were lost. We were told at that briefing that the capacity of Dublin Fire Brigade to deal with such a major event is being undermined by lack of personnel, staff shortages and lack of basic equipment, as I have outlined. In my constituency, there are massive Celtic tiger constructions that have been built over the past 20 or so years. With the changing face of Dublin, the way people live now is very different to the way they lived at the time of the Stardust fire. They live in apartment complexes and the major complaint people have about apartment defects is always around fire safety. If we were to face a major fire in one of these complexes, which have question marks as regards fire safety, and if we had a catastrophe of the nature of what has happened in the UK in more recent years, we would be looking at each other at an Oireachtas committee saying that we were told and asking what we did about it. We are still about 100 people short of what is needed to properly service the fire hazard needs of this city. It is not just what these people do as regards fire but it is also to do with rescue, cardiac arrests and various other things that firefighters and people in Dublin Fire Brigade are trained to deal with. I know from the Minister's response that he is across this issue but all of us in politics are always fearful of the day when we are sitting in a committee meeting knowing that we have been told, that it was outlined to us and that we did not do enough when told to prevent it. We are all very wise after an event. Whenever anything happens in politics, or some major catastrophe, event or occasion, everybody is wise after the event. Everybody can tell you exactly what should have happened but we are being told about this now. For Dublin Fire Brigade to ballot for industrial action is a huge move from those members. It is nothing to do with pay or conditions. It is all to do with the service in which they are proud to serve and the uniform they put on. I can only imagine how a family member of a firefighter feels every time they leave home in order to go to work because I am quite sure there is a percentage of their brain that worries about them coming back through that door again. Other jobs are just not like that. Every fire station has a dedication to somebody whose life was lost or changed as a result of the work they do. If they are telling us, unselfishly, that they need more people to do their jobs and protect the city then they absolutely must be listened to. If they are saying to people like me that they do not have any capacity to deal with a fire over the sixth storey of an apartment block, they have to be listened to. These are the front-line heroes we keep hearing about. We cannot keep congratulating people for the work they do day to day, as well as on days like today, then not listen to what they have to say and force them to go down the route of industrial action. It is a shameful day when firefighters, fire personnel and Dublin Fire Brigade have to ballot for industrial action. For people in my constituency, every northside Dubliner, and probably every Dubliner and most people in this country, when they hear the word "Stardust" they know exactly what that means. It was 40 years ago but all of us have been shaped by that event. None of us wants to be in a situation - and I am repeating the point - of saying in a number of years after an event that we were told and did not do enough. These people are telling us now, in an unselfish fashion, using the most powerful method they have by potentially withdrawing their labour and going through an industrial action process, about the deficiencies in the service. We have to do our bit. We are all collectively supporting this motion but what we need is a service with 1,040 members, as has been advocated for. That is the service we need. We should not just go up to 965, which will happen when the 45 people the Minister said are currently in training are added. These people deserve better. We are reminded today of the sacrifices they make every day, and of their families, who I am sure wonder every day if they are going to cross back over the threshold of the home when they come back from work.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Those of us who campaigned vigorously for the repeal of the eighth amendment were told at the time that, in terms of legislation underpinning reproductive rights for women in this country, there would be a review within three years. That gave an awful lot of comfort to those who were a little disquieted by some of the elements of the legislation. That review has commenced and consultation has started but there is disquiet over the intention of the Cabinet not to revisit the legislation itself. Can I ask the Taoiseach bluntly whether he has ruled out any changes to the legislation that underpins the right to terminate a pregnancy in Ireland?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The programme for Government commits to assist owners of latent defect properties by identifying options for those who have been impacted by defects to access low-cost long-term finance and to bring forward law reform to improve the legal remedies for homeowners dealing with defects. Last night, I had a meeting with the Construction Defects Alliance. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Department have put together a working group which is investigating this issue, as the Taoiseach is aware. We are anxious to know whether the working group is still on schedule to report by the second quarter of 2022 so that any financial implications that may arise from the working group can be included in the budget for next year.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach stated last week that NPHET had not been gagged after the announcement that all Covid communications and requests for interviews were now to be put through the GIS. Who decided that is the way it will be? He also stated last week that he had checked back on what happened the weekend before last and that nobody was stopped from going on any media programme. Is that still his position? Is an investigation under way into who leaked the NPHET decision in the first place or was that just a fabricated row for the Government to distract from the communications omnishambles of the past two weeks? I remind the Taoiseach that I appeared on a media programme last night in respect of the high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters grant that has just been announced by the Government. That RTÉ programme could not get a Government representative to appear on it to discuss the issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Sunday Independent reported last weekend that the Cabinet was secretly briefed about massive job losses and warned that tens of thousands of jobs could be lost when the EWSS ends next April. Can the Taoiseach confirm this is the case? Is the Government carrying out an analysis of companies that have been getting this support and what supports will be put in place to save jobs? The rising cost of living has been mentioned and it is having a major impact on workers and businesses. Private sector unions are to seek pay claims of up to 4.5% next year to reflect the surge in inflation that is eroding what people can afford and standards of living. As the Taoiseach knows, issues around energy bills have been well ventilated in this House. Will the Taoiseach reflect on the fact that going back to normal is not what many people in this economy need? A total of 23% of Irish workers pre-pandemic were in statistical low pay, according to the OECD, and 40% of young people under the age of 30 were in insecure work. That is not an economic model we want to return to and that is not the type of competitiveness that does young people or vulnerable workers any good at all.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There has been an ongoing campaign for a new Garda station in the Dublin 13 and 17 areas on the north side of Dublin. This is a hugely expanding area, where the population is greatly increasing. Projections indicate that there will be approximately 50,000 new residents in the area over the next number of years and in that context, community infrastructure is always going to be important. We were successful in getting a second level Educate Together school over the line through the community association in Clongriffin. My colleague, the Labour Party area representative, Shane Folan, has been campaigning for quite a while for a Garda station to be located in that area serving Dublin 13 and 17. In June 2019 it was announced that the provision of a Garda station was going ahead and a site was proposed at a junction on the Malahide Road opposite the Hilton Hotel. Since then, we have had a number of delays and the pandemic has, understandably, focused attention elsewhere. However, at this stage, it is important for us to get an update. The assistant Garda commissioner said at the time that he was working towards opening a Garda station in the near future. This is important, not just because there have been ongoing issues in the wider region which have been brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice by me and others for quite a number of years but also because any new or expanding community needs basic community infrastructure. Communities need schools, libraries and all of the facilities available to every other community, and at the heart of that would be a Garda station. The site has been identified, the assistant Garda commissioner has said that he is working towards it and the Minister for Justice said the same in June 2019. We are now heading towards 2022 and I am seeking an update from the Government on the situation with regard to this Garda station which is much-needed in the communities of Dublin 13 and 17 and the wider region.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is just not good enough. With the greatest of respect, nowhere in his answer has the Minister of State made any reference to the Garda station proposed by the assistant Garda commissioner and political representatives. To say that the Minister for Justice or her Department has no role in this area is flatly untrue. We all witnessed the debacle involving Stepaside Garda station when there was political involvement. Nowhere in his answer has the Minister of State given any update on the proposed Garda station which I understood to be well on the way to being opened at some stage in the future. The site has been identified and the Garda Commissioner is on board. Political representatives from the previous Government announced this station. I came in here today with the greatest of goodwill and expected to get an update. That is all I asked for; I was not going to make a political charge. All I wanted to do was to outline my understanding of the situation and the process. I understand that because of Covid people may have been distracted for a while. That is understandable but I want to know where we are with regard to this Garda station. The Minister of State has just given me a list of numbers of Garda personnel. He has also said something that I have heard from previous Ministers, which is that it has nothing to do with the Government anyway, but it has.Nowhere in the Minister of State's answer is there any reference to the proposed Garda station, and that is deeply frustrating and disappointing because, genuinely, when I put down the Topical Issue question, I was just expecting to get an update. I did not expect my question to be completely ignored. Where do we go from here? Are we going to get a Garda station or not? My understanding was we were and I wanted to get an update.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister, Deputy Foley. It is fair to say that the sense of partnership between the Department and individual school communities is non-existent. The feeling is that schools are being abandoned, that teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, are being abandoned and that individual school principals are being abandoned, and what they have had as a source of comfort for more than 18 months has been the mantra from Government that schools are safe. When HEPA filters have been raised for the past 18 months, they have been told schools are safe. When antigen testing was being put forward as a tool to battle Covid within schools, they were told schools are safe. Indeed, when the issue of substitution was raised with the Minister, she seemed to be in some way surprised that substitution was even being raised when everybody else in politics knew that schools were screaming out about the issue. What I want to do for the Minister is to provide her with three solutions for the new year. I find the lack of political partnership within these Houses a little discouraging as well. I wrote to her on this very day last month, 16 November, and I asked her to meet with all spokespeople on education from all Opposition parties so that collectively we could convey to her what we were hearing from school communities and she could then act on it in a spirit of partnership. That meeting has not taken place. There is no sense that that meeting will ever take place. In fact, the only reason she is here today is because members of the Opposition demanded it. That lack of communication from her even to members of the Opposition is mirrored by the poor communication from the Department to individual school communities who feel that they are not being listened to. The only reason schools are open and in any way functioning is the dedication, the patriotism and sense of genuine public service of our teachers, SNAs and principals, all those volunteers who go with every school community, and school caretakers and the secretaries. I remind everybody, perhaps in future political debates or debates in public discourse, that whenever they feel the need to criticise teachers or SNAs, they should remember this pandemic and that it was not the political leadership of the Government or the Department of Education's attitude that kept schools open but it was teachers, SNAs, school principals, secretaries, caretakers and everybody in those school communities. I have three suggestions. First, there needs to be an early decision on the leaving certificate. It is not tenable for us to say that the leaving certificate can go back to the way it was in 2017, 2018 and 2019 when it comes to 2022. The level of disruption that fifth year and sixth year students in this senior cycle have endured has been unfair. They missed out on some in-school teaching last year. They are now in a situation where, effectively, there is a substitution crisis at second level and much of what they would have been expecting to learn is just not being taught. An acknowledgement of that early from the Department would be welcome along with a process rolled out this year as happened last year. Let us just do it. Let us acknowledge that they have lost out and that they can have a hybrid model of in-school written examination allied with the assessed grade model similar to that rolled out last year because, in fairness, any second level principal will tell the Minister that students are not learning as they should be and whatever adjustments the Department is saying to the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will be rolled out will not go far enough. Second, we cannot treat every school the same when it comes to this pandemic. Areas in my constituency have the highest infection rate in the country. Why not have a crack team of education and public health officials proactively engaging with these schools where a raft of students and half the staff are out to ascertain what resources they need, be it HEPA filters and so on? Why do we have such a generalised view of what every school community is doing? It is not difficult to get the data. Here is a high infection area. Here is an area where it is clearly a problem. Here is an area where the school is obvious struggling. Let us proactively engage with that school. What happens? For example, in a school in my constituency with the highest infection rate in the country a number of weeks ago, 58% of the students were out and people could not get anybody on the phone for a week. That is a practical suggestion for the Minister. Let us get rid of the trench warfare between different Departments, let us work together and identify areas where the infection rate is high, and let us proactively engage with those schools. However, that would, of course, take the Department of Education to actually believe that it has a role in the day-to-day management of schools. The attitude the Minister has inherited is that you are on your own. Third, as a practical suggestion, I note that the roll-out of vaccination for five- to 12-year-olds will take place in vaccination centres in the new year and I welcome that. It will be a game changer for education. Why are we not doing it in schools? Why do we not roll out the vaccination for five- to 12-year-olds, not in vaccination centres but in schools? While we are at it, why do we not vaccinate the school staff in the process?It just makes so much sense. We are asking parents to go to a vaccination centre to get their children vaccinated. Why not be proactive and go to the school community, vaccinate the children on site and vaccinate the staff - teachers, SNAs, secretaries and caretakers - at the same time? It makes perfect sense. It has been done before. I will leave the Minister with three points. Let us change the leaving certificate and do what we did last year. Let us have proactive engagement with areas of high infection rates in a way that will make a difference, and let us vaccinate young people where they are learning to ensure schools can remain open.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have to agree.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the comments that Tánaiste made earlier on the leaving certificate. I understand a meeting is taking place today with the education partners. There have been some very welcome comments from Government sources, including Deputies and Senators, who have been advocating for a hybrid model for the leaving certificate. Does the Tánaiste agree with these comments that have come from his own party? Will he commit that between today and tomorrow we will have finality on this?If the Cabinet is meeting tomorrow, there would be a reasonable expectation from the students who are sitting their leaving certificate that some clarity will be brought before the weekend because this really cannot trundle on much further than that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have been calling for a hybrid leaving certificate for this year's cohort of sixth year students since last July, when I raised the issue with the Minister in the Chamber and in the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, on the basis of what these students missed in fifth year. However, I must say I do not believe the Minister is the problem. In fact, I believe the Minister has always acted correctly when it comes to the leaving certificate. In 2020, when the Minister inherited the assessed grades system from her predecessor, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, we in the Labour Party encouraged her to delete the school profiling element of leaving certificate 2020. The Minister did so, and did it for the right reasons. Quite a number of students got a fairer leaving certificate as a result. Last year, we appealed to the Minister to listen to the students because of what was happening 12 months ago. Again, the Minister did the right thing. When others were walking away from the table, the Minister was encouraged by the advocacy of the students who were at the heart of that campaign for a hybrid leaving certificate, found the solution and delivered it. I was the first to congratulate her on that occasion. Now, the Minister has the opportunity to stand up in the face of those who sound like Shirley Valentine's husband, Joe, who said they always had steak on Thursday, when it comes to the leaving certificate. I do not understand why so many voices in education are so wedded and married to the traditional leaving certificate. What is so glorious about it? As the Minister is aware, we in the joint committee are listening to testimony after testimony about the leaving certificate as it currently stands, why it needs to be radically overhauled and reformed, how it is completely out of date, how it has not really changed since I did it or from the 1980s, when people older than me did it. We have heard how it is effectively the same, how it is far too much of a burden on young people at the end of their senior cycle and how it does not really reflect the abilities of young people as they go into the next stage of their lives. We have heard what they are asked to be assessed on and how they are assessed is completely out of date. All of these things are effectively being accepted by anybody who has an objective look at the leaving certificate. It is brutal and cruel. It may be transparent and fair, but it is very unfair for anybody who has ever had to go through it. I am quite sure that if you ask any Irish person whether they still have nightmares about their leaving certificate, they will say yes, and they will know that subject gave them nightmares. For me, it was biology. Even now, with this national education conversation happening about the leaving certificate being unfair, I ask the Minister to imagine what it is like for students going through this unbelievably unfair and brutal process this senior cycle. Add into the mix the fact they are doing it in a pandemic, they missed a load of months in fifth year, they have effectively since October been facing issues with teachers and students being out because they are sick, and there is no guarantee that is going to change anywhere between now and June. Others have mentioned the advocacy of the ISSU. I think the ISSU has been central to the change in the way education is being talked about. As the Minister knows, far too often in education, we have heard from everybody else except the students, young people or the children. We have heard from all these other people. We have heard those who have made these "we always have steak on Thursday" type remarks. They are married and wedded to the system they cannot move away from. They are rigid. They are the voices that rejected or were resistant to change in the junior certificate a number of years ago. They are the voices that are still resistant to change in the leaving certificate. I must say, in this Chamber as a Labour Party politician, I am disappointed by the response of the teacher unions to this debate. I think they could be more imaginative and responsive to the needs of their students. They advocated for schools not to open a number of weeks ago because they asserted the teacher personnel would not be available to keep the schools open. They must realise that if the teacher personnel was not there to keep schools open, then surely the teacher personnel cannot be there to properly empower, instruct and teach the students between now and June. I know of all the arguments that have been put forward about the lack of data from the junior certificate, even though the majority of students actually have done a junior certificate. I know all these arguments about grade inflation. I understand the pressures the third level institutions are highlighting. However, if we are genuinely trying to put the student at the heart of the discussion, then we can always find solutions to these issues and stop problematising all the time. We can find solutions, as we did last year and in 2020. How many debates do we have in these Houses, in committee rooms, in this Chamber and in the Seanad, and in Irish society about the mental health of young people? We have exhaustive debates on the mental health of young people, the stresses on young people and the heavy burdens of living in modern society that are placed young people's shoulders.Despite this, when it comes to the leaving certificate, which is probably the most stressful thing they will do in their young lives, they are doing it in the middle of a pandemic when they are worried about their relations, older people and possibly themselves and the effects on their health that Covid could have. They have gone through all of this and missed out on in-school learning. They have had to do remote learning. If they are in a disadvantaged situation, it is doubly compounded. They now face a situation where they are unsure about their teachers being in. They have all this uncertainty about the leaving certificate. We will say in our response with regard to mental health that we have to go back to the traditional leaving certificate. It is like saying we always have steak on Thursdays. What I say to the voices in education is that they should try to broaden their perspective on what we are trying to achieve. This is not a quick fix. It is not necessarily an easy thing to do. I am quite sure the Minister has her view on this but she wants to make a comprehensive announcement. There is not really any point in the Minister saying she believes in a hybrid model and then for all the questions to be asked of her and for the answers not to be readily available. I absolutely accept this. She needs to have the teacher unions on board if she is going to pursue a hybrid model. She needs to be able to answer questions on grade inflation. She needs to be able to answer questions on places in further education and third level education. I absolutely accept this. We had an online petition and between students, teachers and parents we received almost 10,000 names. The Minister knows exactly what the ISSU has done. It has taken the time to survey its members and 68% of those due to sit the leaving certificate advocate for a hybrid model. The Minister knows what the Ombudsman for Children has said. The job of the Ombudsman for Children is to assess situations even-handedly and independently to see what is best for young people. Many leaving certificate students are technically still children. In this pandemic and time of national crisis it is his perspective that the best thing for students and for the system is a hybrid model. This is also the perspective of the National Association for Principals and Deputy Principals. With all of this I accept it is not a quick and easy decision. I suggest it probably should have been made before now. If we had had this decision in November, and perhaps if the Minister had listened to me in July, we could be well along the way. I repeat what I said at the beginning. The Minister has always made the right decision. Whatever criticisms I or the Opposition have of the Department or the Minister, and we have had robust exchanges in the House, I have to say I will be steadfast in my view that the Minister has always done the right thing by leaving certificate students and junior certificate students. She inherited an unfair mess in 2020 and justifiably changed it. She changed lives in the way she approached it. Last year, when others were walking away from the table the Minister listened to those who were still there advocating for the student voice and she made the right change. She has the exact same opportunity this year to listen to those putting students at the heart of the discussion, who want what is best for them in this most anxious and uncertain time and who want to deliver to them what they need, which is a hybrid leaving certificate examination. I believe this is the decision the Minister wants to make. If she makes that decision, the Labour Party and other parties in the House will work with her as closely as we can to make it a success. We urge the Minister to conclude her deliberations as soon as she possibly can and make an announcement, if possible this week, that the leaving certificate students who have been advocating so brilliantly in writing emails to their local representatives will get what they have campaigned for, which is the fairest result of a hybrid leaving certificate in 2022.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate my colleague Deputy Nash on putting forward the motion. We did not just start talking about the cost of living today or yesterday. In every budget proposal the Labour Party has put forward in recent years, we have chosen direct State intervention instead of tax cuts because we believe in that. The Minister of State, the Government and the Tánaiste in particular will point to the €500 million worth of tax cuts they have put forward as some kind of cost-of-living intervention but they will not make the difference. What my party colleagues and I have spoken about consistently in the context of education relates to trying to put to bed this lie about free education. The Government decided to give back €500 million last year in its budget. Many of those tax cuts were for people who do not really need them. If the Government had taken €40 million, it would have been able to make every schoolbook in this country free for good, at both primary and secondary level, just as is the case in Northern Ireland. Families do not pay for schoolbooks in Northern Ireland because the state intervenes and provides them for free, yet here, every September parents have to scramble around with schoolbook lists to try to purchase books for their children. Imagine a genuine republic that said to its parents and children that their schoolbooks for their education will be free, just like in Northern Ireland, but the Government did not do that. It gave tax cuts instead. As for voluntary contributions in the school sector, effectively fees, I have proposed legislation that would ban them. The school managers will say that, in order to properly finance the replacement funding, we would need about €46 million. If that is the case, let us do that. Let us make the State intervene and ensure no school will ever again have to ask for a voluntary contribution, because it is not voluntary. Parents feel as though they have to pay it. That is another positive State intervention that could be made instead of a tax cut. As my colleague Deputy Sherlock stated in the context of rising energy costs, about one third of the cost of running a school relates to energy costs, and that proportion will increase, not least because of the rising cost of energy but also because the windows are all open and the children are freezing. Of course, the energy bills will increase and that will be passed on to parents again, whether by a voluntary contribution or a fundraiser. Is there not something repulsive about a school community having to raise money to keep a school going? Is there not something pathetic about that in a republic? Parents have all these conversations with their school about money, and parents who are feeling the squeeze are then less likely to come to the school gate, to hang around or to attend school events or a parent-teacher meeting in case they will be asked for money, whether that is book money, the voluntary contribution or a payment for this or that event.Let me explode the Minister of State's brain for a second. Imagine a genuinely free education system which the Government would prioritise over a tax cut for those who do not really need it. What motivates me and our party is the fundamental difference between what the Government is trying to achieve and the rhetoric it comes out with, and the day-to-day lives people are living and the vision we would have as to how a genuine social democratic country with State intervention would make people’s lives better rather than telling them they are on their own. We tell them to buy their schoolbooks and expensive school uniforms. We put them under compulsion to pay for a voluntary contribution and make them feel under compulsion to go to a school fundraiser to pay for the energy bill. We are not just saying this today or yesterday or because of this motion. We have been saying this every year in every budget proposal that is put forward by my colleague Deputy Nash. That is the difference. When it comes to the hard choice between tax cuts and direct State intervention, the Labour Party believes in State intervention to genuinely tackle the cost of living and education, which should be free.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I urge the Taoiseach to go down to his local second level school at the next opportunity, to walk into the sixth year class and observe the students all wearing masks, with the windows open, to count the number of teachers and students who are out because of the pandemic, and tell them that everything is going back to normal. The Taoiseach knows that if the schools were closed, the Department would find a mechanism to deliver a hybrid leaving certificate. All of the excuses the Taoiseach is trotting out about the junior certificate or the idea that school profiling was going to be essential just do not stand up to any scrutiny. The fact is the Government is dealing with a very conservative Department of Education and is failing to take it on. I implore the Taoiseach to go down to his local second level school and tell the students, with their masks on, the windows open, and the teachers out, that they can just go back to normal. The Government has failed to take on the Department of Education and its conservatism and it has failed the students.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is absolutely unfair.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yesterday, I wrote to the Minister for Education about the leaving certificate, asking her to clarify two matters. The first was what would happen if a student contracted Covid-19 during exam time and what contingencies are in place for that. I also asked her to waive the exam fee, which is €116 for the leaving certificate and €109 for the junior certificate, and I understand there may be some good news in that regard for the thousands of families expected to pay it. Will the Tánaiste confirm it is the intention of the Government to waive the fee for junior and leaving certificate examination students this year?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party supports Ireland's opt-in to the 2021-2027 asylum, migration and integration fund. We take issue, however, with some of the on-the-ground reality within the European Union towards refugees. Statistics released by the Greek Government and confirmed by the UNHCR set the total number of arrivals to Greece in 2021 at 8,000, of which roughly half arrived by sea. The Greek ministry for maritime affairs, however, reports more than 29,000 rescues by the Hellenic Coast Guard in the same period, with just 25,000 people remaining unaccounted for. The reality of the EU's hostility towards migrants and asylum seekers was brought into sharp focus when Irish citizen, Seán Binder, was arrested and charged for crimes carrying up to a 25-year sentence for joining other activists and NGO workers in rescuing African migrants who had got into difficulty in the Aegean Sea. There is a clear issue within the European Union with pushbacks and with migration and integration in practice. Each one of these figures is a human life, yet there are ministers in European governments parroting that it is positive to have low migration flows into Europe. This is true only if refugees are not fleeing; it is an overwhelming negative if refugees are seeking asylum but numbers remain low or decrease. It means that Europe is an unwelcome place that does not believe that desperate people deserve refuge. Ireland is not an outlier in this regard and we must do far more before we can accuse others of not pulling their weight. We in the Labour Party welcome the regularisation programme for undocumented people living in Ireland announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, this week. We also welcome the parallel programme being opened for people in Ireland's asylum system. Regarding the regularisation scheme, however, my colleague, Deputy Bacik, has been critical of the decision to discount time spent in the asylum system when calculating an applicant's time spent living in Ireland. Many people will find they are eligible for neither scheme as a result.We in Labour see this as punishing people for being trapped in a system which this State has acknowledged is inefficient. While the scheme is welcome and is a tribute to the work of the Green Party in government, it could have been much more generous. Last year my colleague Deputy Duncan Smith questioned the Department of Justice regarding the status of refugees and asylum seekers in direct provision and raised the potential for an amnesty to give these applicants citizenship in order to alleviate many of the very serious issues they face and enable those people to find and obtain accommodation where they could live safely during this unprecedented pandemic. We cannot allow human beings to be treated as lesser people. We must completely overhaul our asylum system and we must grant a citizenship amnesty to all asylum seekers and refugees currently resident in Ireland. We must treat all people of Ireland with dignity and respect. I support the programme announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and any such move is definitely progress. Why could this program not be broadened to capture more people who are living and working in Ireland in circumstances of great uncertainty? Someone who is living here, working here, paying tax here and contributing to Irish society belongs here. They are one of us; they are us. The country of céad míle fáilte has a long way to go to live up to that ethos and it begins with conversations like this. When we see these positive moves, why do we need to ask why it is limited? Every week I deal with people who are in these exact scenarios. They work in our communities and contribute to our society. Their kids play on our sports teams and are involved in local community groups. We are all richer for them. We must show basic reality and humanity and be sure we never tell somebody they do not belong. I draw the Minister's attention to a piece published in the Dublin Inquirer this week from Shamim Malekmian. Her piece highlights the ongoing failure to provide long-promised immigration detention centres. In 2021 people who were refused entry to Ireland at our borders were forced to await deportation in prisons. There is sparse information on the numbers of people who are detained in prison for this reason because data are not collected in the absence of a dedicated immigration detention facility. Such a facility was to have been opened in 2020. It is inhumane to detain people in Garda stations and prisons. Another EU directive, the return directive to which Ireland is not a signatory, requires that immigration detention must take place in a specialised facility and that all those detained should have access to legal experts and free legal aid. This is not currently in place. People detained include those seeking asylum. Seeking asylum is not a crime. It is a fundamental human right to be respected by states. Ireland should move immediately to correct this alarming situation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 suspended a worker's right to seek redundancy payments when laid off or put on short-time work due to the pandemic. Deputy Nash of the Labour Party tabled an amendment that would have dealt with this issue at the start of the pandemic and, perhaps, saved the State some share of the burden that may now be necessarily placed upon it. At the time, we agreed not to pursue the amendment as we were assured that the issue would be dealt with and we did not wish to delay emergency legislation. The unamended Covid legislation meant that any employee who ended up being made redundant would have had time during the pandemic excluded from any calculated period of redundancy if time spent laid off or on short-time work in the final three years of redundancy was not included in the original legislation. This Bill is being introduced to ensure there is a scheme to provide a State payment to make up for any time not counted because of time spent laid off during the pandemic. The fact that workers' minimum statutory payments will be made up by the State through a payment from the Social Insurance Fund in such cases should ensure that the worker will not be out of pocket with regard to their minimum payments in the event of being made redundant having been laid off during the pandemic. This is to be welcomed. Normally, under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, when a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund to an employee on an employer's behalf, a debt is raised against that employer. The Department of Social Protection is legally obliged to recover such debts from the employer. If this remains the case, the State will be able to pursue solvent employers. If there is an exemption, we will unfortunately have to put an extra burden on the State, which would not have been needed if this problem had been fixed immediately. In supporting the legislation as outlined, we appreciate that, at the time, the legislation was put forward because of the need for emergency measures. However, through Deputy Nash, we made an attempt to improve the original legislation. We feel that, if we had been listened to, there would not be a need for this measure now. Perhaps in future discussions between those of us in the Opposition and the Government, the Government will appreciate that the Labour Party and other parties in the Oireachtas come to this space with the best of intentions and from a place of knowledge. That is particularly true of my colleague, Deputy Nash. In that regard, while we support the Bill, we would encourage the Government to understand that many of us in this House are genuinely here to try to improve the lot of the worker and not to cause the Government unnecessary difficulty. We support the Bill and will be making further contributions as it goes through the Houses.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is sometimes very hard to know how to articulate something that I have been campaigning on for almost seven years. Along with others, I have been convinced for a long time of the necessity for Ireland to change its drug policy. I have been working with others in other political parties, movements, lobby groups and community groups to try to get Ireland to change its view of the drug user. In all that, there is now space for us to talk as a country about the treatment we have handed down to those who have used drugs, who use drugs and who are in addiction services. There is a significant misunderstanding of the nature of drug use. We have attempted over the course of the history of the State to shame those who take drugs as much as we possibly can, and to criminalise them in an attempt to get them to stop, but that has been the most catastrophic policy failure on any level. It is an expensive disaster that causes misery, pain and death. The people who are most affected by it are the most vulnerable and powerless in Irish society. When we criminalise people for their addiction or drug use, we are actually criminalising marginalisation and disconnection because, disproportionately, the people who come into the criminal justice system as a result of being caught with something in their possession for their own personal use are from areas of disadvantage, are members of the Travelling community, are migrants or are people with disabilities. They are often people who are self-medicating trauma and pain and are trying to seek a connection. Irish society, the Irish Legislature and this State have decided to criminalise that disconnection and marginalisation in an attempt to correct that individual. It does not work. Some 70% of drug cases in front of the courts concern possession for personal use. It is a complete and utter waste of time, money and energy and it does not work.  We are waiting for the Minister of State. I and others in different parties in this Oireachtas have given him time, space and latitude to step up and be the advocate for a citizens' assembly on drugs. It would be easy for us in the Opposition to dismiss the idea of a citizens' assembly on drugs as being a mere talking shop, but my party and I decided that we had to come from a good and fair place to allow such an assembly to be established and advocate within it for what we are trying to advocate for, which is a radical overhaul of drug policy in Ireland. We are still waiting for the Minister of State and the Government to commit to establishing a citizens' assembly on drugs where we can start a proper national conversation on a failed policy and to replace it with something new. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a fantastic opportunity for this Oireachtas to achieve something. In recent years, a justice committee report on decriminalisation of drug users received the support of every political party. We passed radical legislation on the provision of an injecting centre. While it has been objected to, it remains law that we can establish an injecting facility in Ireland. That legislation was passed without a single objection from any Member of in this House. No one in these Houses is standing on a war-on-drugs platform or saying we need to have zero tolerance. Every Member of the Oireachtas, from what I can see, is talking about the humane treatment of the person who is addicted to drugs because of the nature of that person's struggle to overcome the reasons he or she got into addiction and the pathway that person needs to get out of it. I take great comfort from the Minister of State's answer because he is saying we will have a decision on the citizens' assembly on drugs in the coming weeks. Until this point, I have heard so many reasons we cannot have the citizens' assembly. I understand we have Covid and people want citizens' assemblies on other areas, including biodiversity and education. I understand all that. The problem here is that the people who are most acutely affected by this are probably the most powerless people in the State. There is a sense that their addiction is their own fault and there is a significant level of victim blaming. They are probably the only cohort in this land whom people can use a derogatory term to describe on any radio or television programme at any hour of the day or night and get away with it. This is why this is so important. I appreciate the Minister of State's answer, but can we get movement on this in a short time? Can we have the citizens' assembly established before the summer so that we can at least offer those who feel as if they have no voice a process to begin healing and take a new approach to drug use in Ireland?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Since I have come back into this House I have been raising consistently - as have Deputies in government - the need for a citizen's assembly on drugs. We have tried to approach this in good faith so that all the issues we have in respect of drug policy can be discussed in a robust fashion at a citizens' assembly. We believe we have been mature and responsible in that respect. Last Thursday night, I pleaded in this Chamber with the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs to prioritise the citizens' assembly on drugs because lives are at stake. The difficulty is that, unfortunately, Irish society does not value the lives that are at stake. When the announcement came today about the Citizens' Assemblies on biodiversity and a potentially directly elected lord mayor of Dublin, there was a level of devastation within the communities and families that are deeply affected by the issue of drugs. I ask the Taoiseach to please give us some level of hope of a timeline for the citizens' assembly on drugs.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party supports this motion. A lot of things come to mind when talking about the national minimum wage. We need to picture how a parent feels who has worked a hard week on the minimum wage and then wonders how he or she can feed and clothe his or her children and keep them warm. There is an element of fear in the motion but there is also an element of humiliation – that people are working so hard but perhaps have to make choices between food or warmth for their children. This motion is important because we live in a low-wage economy. According to the OECD, 23% of Irish workers are statistically in low pay. It is a massive issue. When Government representatives talk about going back to normal, for many people going back to normal was the grind of working hard to try to provide for their family, but still at the end of the week asking themselves these devastating and humiliating questions as to whether they could feed, clothe and keep their children warm. The Government has rejected all of the presentations given to it about the cost of living and the reality of Irish life, including the Labour Party motion introduced last week by my colleague Deputy Nash, who also established the Low Pay Commission when the Labour Party was last in government. The Government's argument is that tax cuts are the way to bring down the cost of living. We talk to the Government about the fact that nowhere in Europe do people pay for a GP visit except in Ireland, or must families consider whether they have the money to bring their child to the doctor. People in other European countries do not have those humiliating decisions to make. Other European countries do not have the expectation of a second mortgage payment when it comes to childcare.When we talk about going to school and back-to-school costs, other countries just do not have the expectation of parents having to put their hands in their pocket every time they get a communication from their school. We have so many things that families are just expected to pay for that the Government thinks can be resolved by a tax cut. We just had a presentation from the Minister of State who told us €520 million was spent on tax cuts that do nothing for the person on the minimum wage. Whenever it is suggested we increase the minimum wage, you can predict that employer representatives will come out and say it would have a devastating effect on the economy and jobs. That has been proven time and again to be an economic lie because they just do not want to pay the workers. This is connected to what was suggested earlier about trade union recognition. Unfortunately, we do not have the same collective bargaining rights as other European countries enjoy and that is absolutely linked to why we have such an epidemic of low pay in Ireland. Some people do not believe it but 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. Some 40% of workers under 30 years are in insecure work. All the things we ask the Government to do around childcare, school costs, GP care and rent are things it simply will not do. It puts it all in the tax cut bracket which benefits those who do not effectively need any relief compared with people with the humiliating question in their heads at the end of the working week. The suggestion we would increase the minimum wage to something approaching a living wage is something the Government should be embracing. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a living wage. We are two years into this Government. We were all elected this day two years ago. I know the Government was not founded this day two years ago but nonetheless we are approaching the midway point of this Government and yet there is still no energy or sense of emergency around the low pay epidemic or establishing the rationale to give someone that basic sense of dignity and pride that he or she can be a member of this society, engage in it and interact with others on the basis of a sense of equality and decent living standards and eradicate the humiliating question that person may have at the end of the week. In our amendment, we suggest the minimum wage be linked to inflation. That is a perfectly reasonable suggestion. We have to grapple with this epidemic. In any other country where so many people are working in low-paid employment and those people are disproportionately women and migrant workers, it would be at the top of the enterprise agenda. Employer organisations should be mortified. They should be embarrassed and ashamed this is allowed to happen. It is absolutely linked to workers in this Republic feeling they do not have the same power when they are members of a trade union as other workers would have across the EU or the world because the collective bargaining rights in Ireland are not strong enough. What do we do if we give people enough money to survive the week? They have a different sense of themselves, their future and of the country and the community in which they live. They have a different sense of vision and positivity to hand to their children. They can say to their children that the country, the State, the Government and their employer has their back and that everyone effectively believes they have a right to live through their week, to work hard but be in a position to pay their bills and not have the heartbreaking flash across their brain when they are at home at night, looking at their children asleep, wondering if they can feed and clothe them and keep them warm. A living wage is the least we can do so that our citizens can afford to live.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his contribution. The Labour Party broadly welcomes this Bill. I am going to illustrate the impact of white-collar crime with a story. I used to teach in an area of acute disadvantage in the north inner city of Dublin. Whenever I told anybody where I used to teach, they used to always make quips, comments or jokes about crime, despite the fact that I was teaching children. There would always be a joke, snide remark or comment about crime somewhere in the conversation when I mentioned where I used to teach. I recall once that I was trying to arrange a primary school football match against another school and I rang the school as we were trying to organise the game. The guy on the other end said, in a joking way, that he was quite sure that my school’s girls would be good at football because they spend half of their time running away from burning and stolen cars. I kept this to myself, did not challenge him on it, and I was quite happy the next week when we did actually beat the lard out of his side.  The point was that there always seemed to be a sense that our children needed to be fixed and that there was an air of criminality about the area in which they lived. The adjoining area to where we used to work was the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and it was a case of if only our children could be a bit more like them, like those functional members of society who were working hard in these financial institutions. If only our children could aspire to, be more like, speak like and dress like that, that would be better. This was at the height of the Celtic tiger where there were movers and shakers and big moneyed people. That was the kind of sense we used to get in that there was one type of criminality that people used to joke about and refer to but the IFSC was somewhere to which we should really aspire to have our children end up working or be part of.  Lo and behold, a number of years later the malpractice, lies, shoddy deals and the criminality that took place in the IFSC almost brought down the entire State. That is the story of my little school and of what society thinks of those children and what the air and atmosphere of the country was in which they grew up. We do not really think that white-collar criminality is the same. If one walks into any courtroom in the country one will find people generally from a particular socioeconomic background. They are disproportionately affected by addiction issues, housing issues and other issues of social concern. One does not see the type of people who have been so close to events and decisions that almost brought down the State in the dock as often as they should be. I am not saying that people should automatically make snide or derogatory comments about people in different professions like they did about the children I used to teach, but it is important to speak in this Chamber about the effect this type of inequality has on young lives and how young people feel. We are encouraging young people throughout the country to believe in the system and in this Republic, to engage in the political process and to believe the State will have their backs at the end of the day and that people are not out to get them and they respect them but, fundamentally, if we do not have as tough a regime for white-collar crime as for any other type of crime, people will not believe it. They will believe, inevitably, that they should perhaps engage in a parallel economy because they are not going to get respect anyway. We are broadly in favour of this Bill but, as ever, we have to be vigilant to ensure that companies do not dodge the legislation and also to ensure that investigating bodies do not get too cosy with their industries as they use these powers to pursue them actively. The powers include the ability to fine companies a maximum of €10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover for breaches of competition law. This comes on foot of the failure to prosecute any insurers after a five-year investigation into price fixing, which ended in just commitments from insurers. A spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission said the commission is in no way giving the insurance industry a clean bill of health. It has written to the Central Bank to outline broader cultural concerns in the industry which have come to light during the course of the investigation. The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, has welcomed the Bill. There are a number of suggestions from McCann FitzGerald. The law firm said that violations will be easier to prove and fines will be higher, but enforcement will remain challenging. It stated:A new and untested enforcement process, termed “administrative proceedings” in the Bill, is a significant departure for Irish law.  So-called adjudication officers, nominated by the CCPC and approved by the Minister, and paid “per diem, per piece or periodically”, will effectively determine liability for breaches, may issue “prohibition notices” (effectively cease and desist orders), and may order divestment or other structural remedies.Another issue it cites is that the merger control reforms will increase uncertainty, stating:New gun-jumping prohibitions, mandatory information requests for third parties, and CCPC powers to intervene and review below-threshold deals are proposed.  Notably, the CCPC will be able to require parties to notify any deal, no matter its size, if the CCPC believes it “may ... have an effect on competition”. The CCPC will also have powers to require businesses to unwind certain completed mergers, if the CCPC believes the deal may harm competition. The Bill proposes to transpose EU Directive 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council, also known as the ECN+ directive. The purpose of the directive is to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market. This transposition includes granting further powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Commission for Communications Regulation. The powers include the ability to levy administrative financial sanctions for breaches of competition law obligations, which will be set at a maximum of €10 million or 10% of total worldwide turnover. As the Minister of State said, the Bill proposes to make some amendments to Irish competition law, which include a specific offence of bid-rigging with regard to certain anticompetitive practices in bidding and tendering processes, the prosecution of gun-jumping offences and the unwinding of certain mergers after they have been implemented, and to provide for targeted surveillance powers in investigations for certain criminal offences. Broadly, we support the Bill. We will do our best to assist the Minister of State and the Government to strengthen it in any way we can. The Minister of State mentioned that he will be proposing amendments on Committee and Report Stages and we will be as constructive as possible. However, it would give the children I spoke about earlier more confidence in the State and the governance of the State if initiatives or legislation such as this did not arise because of an EU directive but from the deep sense of injustice that the Government should feel when it comes to tackling white-collar crime. I told the story not in any way to diminish the area in which I taught but because it is important for people to understand the profound effects that a stench of inequality has on a person, the person's family and the person's community. When one tries to say to anybody that he or she needs to be more like other people, one is giving the other people a free rein that they do not deserve. They must have the same responsibilities under the law and the same consequences for criminal behaviour.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to know what engagement the Minister has had with the trade union movement on the draft right to request remote working Bill 2022.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue the Labour Party has with the Bill as drafted is that the provisions state that a worker would have to wait 26 weeks before requesting permission to work remotely and then potentially 12 further weeks for an answer. That is 38 weeks, which is the length of a pregnancy. The grounds for refusal from an employer are so wide that the Bill is effectively meaningless. We want a right to flexible work, not a right for an employer to refuse it. This is why I ask what sort of engagement the Minister has had with the trade union movement. I do so because it feels as if this Bill is being written with employers in mind, and not workers. He will appreciate and be aware that remote working has brought a lot of benefits to society for those families that wanted to embrace it. It does not suit everybody and not everybody wants it but female participation in the workforce has increased by 3.5% during the pandemic.Does the Minister agree that his legislation is weighed in favour of employers and not workers? 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Nobody likes the Bill is effectively what the Minister is saying. I take what he said in good faith and if he is willing to look at the timelines and the grounds for refusal, that is fair comment. We will work with him on that but he will have to appreciate that the power balance in any of these situations very much lies with the employer. Workers are unlikely to feel very confident in going through this process if they feel it will diminish their opportunities for advancement in the workplace in the long term. As the Minister will be aware, there are any number of family and environmental benefits to working remotely. The gender equality issue also weighs heavily when we are entering this space because remote working does benefit gender equality in the workplace. We are happy to work with him and we hope he can be true to his word.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Two weeks on from voting down the Labour Party's plans to address the cost-of-living crisis, the Government will announce some token measures today. The package that is emerging is around €450 million, which is a drop in the ocean compared with what ordinary families are having to grapple with. The official Government advice from Ministers is to shop around for better value but those suffering under record rent prices cannot shop around; they need a rent freeze. Those looking at soaring energy bills that are up by 30% cannot shop around for better deals; they need real intervention. Those in low paid work cannot shop around; they need a pay rise. Those forced to commute back to the office cannot shop around; they need the right to flexible work. Those wondering how they will feed their families know that shopping around will not help when bread, milk and butter are all rising in price, having gone up by between 10% and 15% over recent weeks. What we know about the Government's cost-of-living package is that it will not go far enough, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform admitted as much this morning. The Government has already committed to a €100 rebate on electricity bills at a cost of €210 million. If that it is doubled, it will bring it to €420 million. By our calculations, an extra two week's of fuel allowance would cost €21 million, but the Government has not widened eligibility. Figures provided to my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, show that more than 20,000 people who applied for the fuel allowance last year were refused. Already this year, of more than 7,000 applications received, more than 3,000 were rejected. In the budget, we called for eligibility to be extended to an extra 100,000 households, but once again, the Government's response is too little and too late. Bringing forward the working family payment increase by three months will cost around €6 million to €9 million and benefit over 50,000 families. However, for the hundreds of thousands of families struggling with the cost of childcare, education and healthcare, there is nothing of substance emerging. Instead of investing in public services, this Government is interested in tax cuts, in throwing €600 million at people who do not need it. The VAT windfall was €1 billion ahead of projections. In January alone, the VAT take was €400 million ahead of what was collected in January 2020. We have the opportunity and this is about choice. There has been no shortage of solutions put forward to ease the burden on workers and families.  It is time the Government shopped around for some new ideas. Will the Tánaiste commit to an immediate increase in the minimum wage? Will he admit the budget last October got it wrong? Will he now commit to a real mini-budget that will do more than tinker at the edges and provide real relief to workers and families?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What the Tánaiste is engaged in is Bertienomics. He is trying to convince people that the Government can cut their taxes, tinker around with public services and it will all be fine. What the Labour Party has suggested is that there should not be tax cuts. The Tánaiste may think that is an easy thing for an Opposition party to say but it is not. We are telling the people of Ireland straight that if they want to have a proper decrease in their cost of living, the State should provide it and we should not wait for the market to provide solutions on rent or on childcare, and we should not be married to the market as much as this Government. We believe in direct State investment and support. This Government will not introduce a rent freeze. It just will not do it. It will not support a proper publicly funded childcare system, as in every other European country. People in Northern Ireland do not have to pay for schoolbooks or for GP visits but this Government does not have the same vision for citizens in this part of the island. What we in the Labour Party are saying is that we do not want play cheap politics. We do not want to do the auction stuff on tax cuts. We believe in State intervention. What the Tánaiste is trying to do is make cheap political jibes while people are battling for bread, milk and butter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Exactly; childcare. Spending €10,000 a year on childcare. That is the point.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«By the Labour Party.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Thank you.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The cost of living is the dominant political issue at present. The package announced last week is a sticking plaster for the problems families and workers are facing. The private sector committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions met last week and recommended that unions seek pay rises in the range of 2.5% to 5.5%. Does the Taoiseach agree with workers seeking pay rises? The committee also sought to change the small benefits exemption rule to increase the limit from €500 to €1,000 for those earning up to €1,462 per week and for the values to be spread over multiple payments, for example, €100 per month. Has the Government ruled that out or is it under consideration? There should also be a way to encourage private sector employers to reward front-line workers in retail, social care and other sectors who kept our country running during Covid-19 to benefit from a bonus for their work. The Government Bill on the right to request remote working is at pre-legislative scrutiny stage. Will the Government ensure that every worker who was allowed to work remotely during the pandemic will be given the right to continue to access flexible working arrangements?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In the context of what has happened in Ukraine this morning, I ask the Minister of State to give a sense of what his Department can do and what supports he can give to the Ukrainian community here in Ireland through the various organisations with which he has strong relationships. My question relates to the proposed bid for the European championship football tournament in 2028, for which the FAI is co-bidding. What financial supports may his Department have to give in support of that bid?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The nervousness that comes in from football people, who will have different viewpoints on this, is that major infrastructural deficits exist in Irish football. There is controversy over the Dalymount Park plan that is the heartbeat of Irish football, traditionally. There is controversy over what will happen to Tolka Park. One third of all League of Ireland footballers only have a junior certificate as a qualification. This is a much-loved and very important game. It is much-loved in the more disadvantaged areas of our country, which is probably why it has been so politically powerless, traditionally. There are so many needs within this game and deficits in the relationship between the State and the football communities in Ireland that the hosting of this tournament has to be questioned. I am glad to hear the Department is questioning the FAI's approach.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that. The general point is that if one thinks about where football is, its interaction with the education system is minimal compared to other codes. There is greater energy and atmosphere around the League of Ireland than there has been for a number of years. I look forward to going to Dalymount Park on Friday evening to support Bohemian FC. The infrastructure around the League of Ireland is not perfect. It is only five years since the women's team effectively went on strike because of the lack of respect it was getting from within the association. We also know of all the controversies that have taken place heretofore. Football is so important and so powerful. We have such diverse senior teams in women's and men's sides representing this country. A Traveller woman plays for the Irish women's team and a number of lads with various ethnic backgrounds play for the senior men's team. This is an exciting time for Irish football. The issue really is that we grab that and invest in a different way than with the big prize of hosting a big tournament, the benefits of which are unknown.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join the other Members in what they have said about the next phase of this process. I would also ask if we have a vision into the future so that we could front-load funding for local authorities. I believe that, in certain circumstances, there are clubs that have expertise within them, perhaps those who have greater education or that have planning experts, engineers, barristers, teachers or whoever on their sporting committees, and there those other sporting clubs that do not have that level of expertise, and this second group can fall through the gaps during funding process. Is it not better as a long-term strategy for the Government to support local authorities to have an audit of the sporting needs in any geographical area and for them to have municipal sporting facilities so that all sporting bodies can benefit from them, rather than having these competing interests within any one geographical area?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am greatly encouraged by the Minister of State's response. The vision the Minister of State is outlining is something that I really welcome. The possibility that we will have an audit of the sporting needs of any given community, and that the local authority will be the driver for that, is something that will be welcome. I look forward to working with the Minister of State on it. We would not want to see a particular sporting code or sporting pursuit fall by the wayside or fall through the cracks because some other sporting pursuit possibly has more muscle or more educated people behind its applications. I hope I am using appropriate language. I take great encouragement from what the Minister of State has outlined and I look forward to working with him on it into the future.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not need an answer. I am okay.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Tully for the work she has put into this motion. In my work, several things strike me when I meet the parents of children with additional needs. I refer to the exhaustion and the frustration, as well as the challenge of dealing with a diagnosis that can be quite difficult. It is a learning process. Parents can be dealing with a diagnosis they did not know anything about and which they must endeavour to understand better. They must try to understand the terminology involved and then empower their wider family. Then, they must be at least a part-time campaigner, if not a full-time one, to wage war against the State. That is what is so disappointing about this situation.Parents live their lives as citizens of this republic and do everything they feel is right. They pay their taxes, obey the law and live a good life, but all of a sudden they have a child in their care who they love deeply and they can see the State is coming up short. That leads to a major level of resentment within a family and it can feel as if nobody is really speaking, caring, advocating for their child or empowering their child. It leads to incredible issues within the family unit. I have come across families who are absolutely exasperated and exhausted. It feels as if wherever we turn in Irish society, other people are stepping up. The average GAA club takes on all-star sections to encourage children with additional needs to play Gaelic games. I know of initiatives to make towns and village centres around the country autism-friendly and we are trying to encourage that in Raheny and Donaghmede in my constituency. There seems to be an awareness and understanding among lobby groups of the need to listen better to organisations like AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland and others. There seems to be a uniformity of approach to empower, understand and listen to families and the likes of the Ombudsman for Children, who spoke today. The one area where we feel there is a lack of evidence of stepping up, unfortunately, is with the State. The Ombudsman for Children remarked today about the fact that more than 34,000 children are waiting over a year for community health services, which is a stunning statistic. When I meet people who work in the HSE, they speak of the retention and recruitment issue, which has been referenced in the Minister of State's remarks. However, the Labour Party made suggestions last April in a Private Members' motion that was, again, accepted by the Government. It advocated that the State should bring forward a national autism strategy. The Government is not opposing this evening's motion and it did not oppose our motion last year. Unfortunately, the action is lacking. I can go to services in my constituency, such as ABACAS school in Kilbarrack, where I can see the conditions that children are expected to learn under. When I meet the parents, they feel that once again, for whatever reason, their children are not at the top of the political priority list. I understand the Minister of State saying this is not a resources issue and there are other factors. This is not a new problem and it has been evident for a number of years. Parents have been trying to access school places in my constituency. When they do so, they are handed a list of schools by the special educational needs organiser with the State again stepping away from the responsibility to find a school place. A parent has to go to school after school, even 17 schools in one case, to try to find a school place for a child. A school place in Drogheda was suggested for a child despite the child living in Donaghmede. There is an absolutely unbelievable type of expectation on parents who again are coming to terms with a diagnosis, terminology and challenges within the family that are absolutely exhausting them. I believe we can agree that we should have a vision of a republic where any child with a diagnosis, a need or a challenge would have the State enveloping the child with such compassion and the family with such empowerment that the family would feel proud to live in this country. They should be able to say to anybody they know in another country that when they got the diagnosis, despite it being challenging, there was an immediate assessment of need and interventions. They should be able to say the school was absolutely resourced to accept the child and build his or her education. They should be able to say the community in which they live knew exactly how to interact with the child and family. They should be able to celebrate eventually because they are enabled to learn so much from the child. That could be the vision that we could achieve collectively. What happens, however, is that a family gets a diagnosis and it is a devastating moment in life because they know the State will not help. It is not a small decision for a family to end up in court and many of these families have never stood in a courtroom before. It is not something that comes naturally to them. How depressing must it be to walk into a courtroom and see the symbol of the country over the judge's head and know this republic is letting you down? Last April we put forward a motion on a national autism strategy and we were trying to bring all the different elements of government into one movement and make things better. This was so families could feel as if they could point to a strategy. Again, this is a political point. When we have arguments over tax and spend in this Chamber, the Ministers of the Government justify tax cuts to the tune of €500 million. I always think of these families when that happens. The Minister of State may say it is not about resources or funding but it comes down to that at some level. This is not a new problem or something that has just arrived today. I have been dealing with it for at least three years. I want the Minister of State to consider again a national autism strategy and make a commitment that we can drive down these numbers. We must be able to say to the families of this country that they do not need to be exhausted or work as campaigners because this State will absolutely support and empower them. I spoke about the ABACAS school in Kilbarrack, and nobody in the Government should feel the conditions there are acceptable. The Ombudsman for Children, the Opposition, lobby groups and others are stepping up. I have mentioned GAA clubs and community initiatives. They all see across society the value in understanding and empowering. It is deeply frustrating when the State does not appear to understand it too.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will the Minister issue a directive to further and higher education institutions to retain certain flexible teaching mechanisms after the pandemic to support disabled students, those who cannot afford to live in university towns and those who are immunocompromised?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know the Minister cannot necessarily direct institutions but he does give them money and could attach a few conditions to that. I agree with him that we need to think differently about education and learn something from the pandemic. Indeed, the idea of having an institution without walls is something I am particularly attracted to. However, the fact is that issues in respect of renting, the accommodation problems students are facing and disability were overcome in a way which showed a lot of ingenuity, forward thinking and thinking outside the box. That is what we always want our institutions to do. Will the Minister proactively interact with all the institutions of further and higher education to ensure that they have thought about every opportunity to break down those walls and that they will not say, in a post-pandemic era, that those solutions are a thing of the past? They have to be brought into the next phase.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Minister will know, people with disabilities have lower rates of progression to third level. My colleague, Senator Hoey, has been speaking on this recently. They have lower progression rates to third level than the general population. The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, reported that approximately 12% of students disclosed a disability in a recent survey. The true figure may be as high as 20%. With regard to access to third level, further and higher education, this could be a fantastic tool to use into the future. The physicality of a university campus or further education facility does not have to be any kind of barrier to people engaging in learning. Remote learning will be a very significant part of that. As the Minister has said, the walls absolutely can be broken down. Within all that, we also need to understand that these institutions will need funding streams to roll that out.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We thank very much all the Deputies across the House who will support the motion and we commend the work of Senator Sherlock, who, on having examined the Government's proposals, committed to producing her own legislation, which she is now pursuing. The Government's proposals, which would require employees to wait up to 26 weeks before they could ask to work remotely and a further 12 weeks before a decision is made, that is, a full pregnancy of 38 weeks before an employee might actually be given the right, go to the heart of all workers' rights legislation in this Republic. A worker has the right to ask, but it will always be the employer's right to say "No". It feels as though the Government handed its legislation to IBEC and asked it to script it, and then presented it to the House and was surprised people would have an issue with it. We had a round-table discussion, organised by Senator Sherlock, at which we heard from Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland, Liam Berney of ICTU, Louise Bayliss of SPARK, Gareth Murphy of the Financial Services Union, Fleachta Phelan of the Disability Federation of Ireland, and Alan Eustace, all of whom argued that we need to grasp this opportunity that has been presented to us during the pandemic. We are not suggesting a young worker will not want to go into the workplace. I can appreciate that somebody who is starting out in life may have housing or accommodation difficulties whereby working from home may not really be an option for him or her, given that person may not wish to grasp the opportunity of working at the end of the bed, for example. If, however, a worker in good faith has the opportunity to work from home, why do we once again have to place all the power in the hands of the employer? It is as though there is a lack of trust at the heart of Irish legislation such that the worker will always try not to be honest. If we are honest with ourselves as a legislative body, however, we will appreciate that the productivity of the worker would improve if he or she did not have to run on this treadmill of traffic congestion and rush and push in the morning and of having to deal with childcare arrangements. Indeed, this is a gender equality issue, given it will encourage more women into the workplace and to seek empowerment there too. Furthermore, it goes hand in hand with the right to switch off. It cannot be that in Irish workplaces, whether at home or in the traditional work setting, workers must be constantly contactable, whereby they do not have the right to switch off and are expected to receive a message or email at any hour of the day or night. We are trying to expose the fact that what the Government has brought forward in this right to flexible working legislation is actually the right of an employer to say "No". There are 38 weeks before a worker can get a decision. The reasons for refusal are so wide as to make the workers powerless. In good faith the Labour Party has been working assiduously on this. Senator Sherlock, as our workers' rights spokesperson, has been drafting legislation. She had correctly pointed out the issues in the legislation. A number of weeks ago, the Tánaiste told me some employers were not happy with the Bill either. It is quite clear nobody on either side, workers or employers, is necessarily impressed with the Government's legislation. We cannot have a situation where somebody has to wait 26 weeks before applying to work remotely. We cannot have a ridiculous situation where people have to wait 12 weeks to get an answer. We cannot have the employers' rights of refusal to be so broad as to make the legislation worthless. As my colleague Deputy Sherlock has said, it is a gender equality issue and it is a workers' rights issue. It is about taking from the pandemic all we have learned and bringing it into the mainstream of the workplace and workers' rights. I hope the Taoiseach and representatives from the Government might listen to this. My greatest regret of ten years ago at the time of the previous crisis is that we did not learn enough from the financial collapse and build a more robust economy on the basis of workers' rights and human interaction. Having learned from what happened in the pandemic, we have an opportunity to do things much better. This is why we have tabled the motion. We do not want the Government just to support the motion; we want it to work on it and make the legislation better.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will speak of Ukrainian children who may come into our education system. A child coming to a new country, walking into a classroom and not understanding what anybody is saying faces a particularly difficult experience, especially if that child has run for his or her life. Children of Ukrainian-Irish families and children of a Russian background in our school system will also need support. Will the Taoiseach speak to those families and to the Government's intention to provide every support possible to Ukrainian and Russian children currently in our education system, those who may be coming into the system and to those teachers, SNAs and school communities who will be working with these families? Will he give an assurance that no resources will be spared to ensure their experience in the education system is empowering?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to disapply at separate future dates, in relation to recognised primary and post-primary schools, the exemption provided by certain enactments from the prohibition against discrimination on the gender ground in educational establishments, and to provide for connected matters.I thank my Labour Party colleagues for co-signing this Bill, which provides for all schools in receipt of State funding and recognised by the Department of Education to reflect society outside the school gate, which they serve. We have an unusual scenario in Ireland whereby 17% of Irish primary school children attend single-gender schools. At second level that figure is 30%. Since 1998, the Department of Education has not given sanction or recognition to a new single-gender school. Effectively, for the past 25 years the Department has decided we should be moving towards a co-educational model.It is strange to me, therefore, and I expect to anybody who comes to this country from elsewhere, that we are so obsessed with separating children. We love separating them on the basis of religion, gender and income. If we really are serious about our education system, there are a number of issues we must consider. We have to look at equality in education, eradicate illiteracy, end educational disadvantage and make education entirely free. We also need to get rid of the legacy issues in the Irish education system, including why we consider it so important that boys go through one gate and girls through another. It does not stand up to any analysis anywhere internationally that such separation is good for children or society. In my constituency, in places like Raheny and Marino, for example, parents are beginning to ask strong questions as to why their children need to be separated for school, with one gate for the boys and another for the girls. I see strong young women in Maryfield College in Drumcondra who are standing up against this old-fashioned, outdated practice of demanding girls wear skirts to school. They have managed to change the uniform practice in their school. It is time for the State to lay out a vision that all children and young people should go to the same schools and that we do away with outdated gender stereotypes. There is no reason why girls need to go to one school and boys to another. On that basis, our Bill proposes that, over a ten-year period, we get rid of the single-gender legacy issue for primary schools. We are trying to be as reasonable as we possibly can in providing for a period of ten years to make the change. We recognise that conversations are needed in school communities and between patron bodies. We acknowledge that the Department of Education has to lead this charge. After ten years, however, it is our vision that every primary school in the State will be co-educational. In addition, after 15 years, we want every second level school in the country that is in receipt of State funding and recognition from the Department of Education to be co-educational. If we are serious about gender equality, this seems to be the only area of Irish public policy about which we never speak. We talk about gender equality in sport, politics, the media and business, but our education system is separated on the basis of gender to a degree that is unparalleled outside of the Arab world and we seem never to want to tackle it properly. We are trying to be as practical and reasonable as possible in our proposals in this Bill. There is no justifiable reason to contrive a scenario where all the boys go through one gate and all the girls through another. It does not stand up any more. Let us have an education system that is truly reflective of the society outside the school doors. Let us believe in gender equality. If we pass this legislation, we will be in a position, after ten years, to ensure all our primary schools are co-educational and the same for all secondary schools after 15 years. Our education system will then properly reflect the society it tries to serve, which is a co-educational society in which there is gender equality.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister will know that I have been raising the issue of a free schoolbooks scheme for many years now. I want to see one in this State that mirrors the one that is available in Northern Ireland, where no parent pays for a schoolbook. The Minister has initiated a pilot scheme. At what point can we expect to see a free schoolbook scheme in every school in the country at primary and secondary level?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can tell the Minister where the strengths are. She just has to look across the Border. Anybody from the North who comes to live in the South will tell her that it is ridiculous that they have to go scrambling around looking for a book list and trying to get schoolbooks for the new school year. They just do not think it is their role. All of these conversations at school community level about buying books and book rental schemes are replacing conversations about education or child development. There is an opportunity for the Minister. A sense of vision should creep into the Department of Education. It should say that it will work towards a situation where there are free schoolbooks for every child in the State. This would cost €20 million at primary level and €20 million at secondary level as well. The sort of administrative burden that has been placed on schools because of book rental programmes, whereby they have to chase down the book money and put an onus on parents to go and get the books, would all be eliminated by such an investment. Every school in the country and every child in the country would have schoolbooks as a right for free.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will make a prediction for the Minister. In years to come, people will think it is ridiculous that we had this debate about children having free schoolbooks because it is such a basic provision. It is provided in so many European countries for free. You only have to go across the Border to witness it. I will ask the Minister a blunt question. When will the pilot be done and when will the expansion begin? It is clear to anybody who is listening to this debate that of course a pilot scheme whereby children get free schoolbooks will be successful. It will replace many conversations about books, acquiring books, book money and book rental schemes with conversations about child development and education. As I have said, all those other discussions should be happening. I have a simple question. When will the pilot end and when will the expansion begin?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know about it because the Labour Party introduced it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«When will the staffing schedule for 2022-23 will be published?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I just want to know what "in the coming weeks" means. The Minister will appreciate that principals tell me that they need to plan for September. Even though it is off the front pages of the newspapers and outside the media circle of conversation, they are still dealing with Covid on a daily basis. I spoke to a teacher yesterday who said that approximately one third of the student body had been out because of Covid-related illness. If the Labour Party Parliamentary Party is anything to go by, seeing as we have lost half of our members to Covid this week, I am quite sure that staffs around the country are having a similar problem. Covid is something that the schools are still having to deal with. They need to be able to plan for September. Can I get something a little better than "in the coming weeks"? If I go back to a principal who has asked me to raise this and say "in the coming weeks", they will want to know what that means.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate all those factors and I appreciate the Minister's comments about the commitment of teachers, SNAs and school principals. I have raised, as have other Deputies, the need to analyse and quantify the damage to young people, which was outside the Minister's control, over the past two years in terms of social interaction, anxiety and loss of in-school learning. That point needs to be made in the context of planning for September. If we do go back to something approaching normality in September, then there must be recognition from the Department that a lot of really profound damage was done to young people over the past two years. I impress on the Minister that the schedule be published as soon as possible in order that school communities, teachers, SNAs and principals can plan for September.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I find these debates depressing. There is an absolute poverty of ambition or vision in the Minister's speech and from her Department with respect to any real belief in what our education system could be like. In Finland 50 years ago they had an educational revolution. We have been through two crises in the last ten years. One was an economic collapse and we are at present coming out of a health emergency, yet there has been no real attempt by the Department or the Minister leading it to have a vision of a wholly different education system. What the Finns did, if the Minister were to study it, was put equality at the heart of the education system. Everything that was received and handed down was torn up and they started again. What is absolutely illegal now in Finland is fundraising or fee-paying schools because they said equality should be at the heart of the education system. The problem is that far too many of the conversations happening in school communities, between schools, between parents or between parents and their children are about money. They are about money. There is a poverty of ambition and vision within the Minister's Department. Earlier we had a conversation about schoolbooks. One only has to look 100 miles up the road. Anybody in the North would consider it bizarre that people would have to put their hands in their pockets to buy schoolbooks for their child so they could go to school. This is the type of mentality we need in this Republic, namely, that it is bizarre that people have to put their hands in their pockets to buy schoolbooks for their child - because the Republic should provide that. However, there is a poverty of ambition and of vision. School parents' association are just fundraising bodies. They just organise fundraisers. They do not talk about education. They do not talk about child development. They do not talk about all the fantastic, wonderful, experiences children should be having in the school environment. They do not talk about any of that stuff. They just talk about money and how to raise it. It is pathetic. It is pathetic that one would have to have a fundraiser for a school. As for the idea of voluntary contributions, it has been pointed out they are not voluntary. They are voluntary in name. How crushing must it feel for a parent that a notice comes down from the school in their child's fist and know this a barrier between the child and his or her full involvement in school life, because if one cannot come up with the goods, if one cannot come up with the money, one is less likely to fully engage in school life. One is less likely to go to the school gate. One is less likely to go to the parent-teacher meeting, the football match or the school play, lest one comes into contact with a school staff member who feels he or she must ask one because the money is needed to run the school. Money, money, money, money, money - the conversation always comes down to money. It is not just the fact you feel humiliated by that, it is also about the replacement conversation people are not having. People are not talking about, as I mentioned, child development. People are not talking about advances in educational thought. People are not talking about how their child might be struggling in school. People are not talking about potential bullying incidents in school, about subjects or about innovative initiatives in learning. People are not talking about any of that stuff. It is money, money, money, money, money. Here is a vision for the Minister we could all work on together. The Government threw away €500 million on tax cuts in its last budget and it comes back to those choices. If the Minister took €100 million, which is one fifth of that, she could make every schoolbook in this State free for every child at primary and secondary level and €45 million would replace the amount of money taken in in voluntary contributions, according to the Catholic Primary School Management Association. Imagine the freedom a school principal would have. Imagine the time that would be saved by a school principal, who is supposed to be a learning leader. Rather than chasing after parents for money, organising fundraisers, turning off lights and worrying about heating bills, the principal could think and talk about the delivery and leading of learning. Imagine that. This is what I am challenging the Minister and her Department to do. They should think differently, just as was done in Finland 50 years ago, and dispense with all this tinkering around the edges. This is what is so depressing about these debates. It is so much tinkering around the edges. We have come to the conclusion that a parent should expect to have to go to a fundraiser for his or her child's school. Is there not something utterly pathetic about that? However, we are just so used to it we accept it. The Minister would get broad support from across these Houses if she were to institute budgetary measures and the legislative underpinning to rule out certain things. Why do we not ban voluntary contributions rather than only making it more clear what they pay for? We should ban them. Alternatively, the Minister could take the view we could look towards what happened in Finland and say that over a period of time we could have a fully-funded education system that does not come down to conversations about money. We could take the template from the Six Counties, where nobody puts their hand in their pocket for a book. We had to ask the Minister to get rid of the fee for the leaving certificate earlier this year. Again, those from the North who are living here think it bizarre one would have to pay money to sit a State exam. We accept all these things as being the norm, we tinker around the edges and have debates in this House, all while the Minister has such a capacity to drive forward a revolutionary change in the way education is run and in how schools are run. However, there is a poverty of mindset within the Department and people there who really do not think it is their problem. They do not think it is down to them. One has all the power with the individual patron bodies, the board of managements will do what they can do and then if a school must have a fundraiser then that is the way it goes. Inevitably, there is a deep inequality in that because as the Minister knows, in affluent areas people can raise an awful lot more than can those in areas of disadvantage. The Minister knows that. However, as long as she allows that to continue there is going to be a fundamental inequality in how schools can run themselves. I know this because, as Deputies across the House will be aware, we are in a post-Covid era and so the fundraisers have started again. Teachtaí Dála are getting requests to take out ads in various different fundraising booklets because are they beginning to ask their Teachtaí to come to fundraisers. Is it not absolutely pathetic that part of a Teachta Dála's job is to give money to a school fundraiser? Why do we not completely recast our brains and come to the bizarre conclusion that maybe the State should just fund the schools, pay the bills and not have this constant, money-oriented, transactional conversation between school communities, parents and children? I know what it is like to chase a mother for the book-rental money. It is humiliating for the school and the parent. With the best of good will and from a genuine place, I challenge the Minister to go back to the Department and say maybe it is absolutely pathetic that in a republic there are such things as school fundraisers, voluntary contributions and that we ask parents to pay for schoolbooks. She should suggest we front-load the funding to our schools so all these transactional, financial conversations are replaced by conversations about education. Imagine that as a revolutionary thought. The Finns did it and it is the day-to-day reality in the North.Rather than tinkering around the edges, let us have a genuine conversation about the State having a day-to-day, genuine funding role in the running of our schools and let us rule out certain elements of school community life, for example, being expected to raise money or contribute voluntarily to the running of a school and having to pay for a schoolbook. It is fundamentally pathetic. Until educational leaders such as the Minister and those in her Department get that into their heads, we will just be tinkering around the edges.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister mentioned that he met the energy regulator last week. That is welcome. I encourage the Minister to meet representatives of the regulator - the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU - again to suggest the regulator does what is being done in the UK where demands have been made of energy suppliers to put every customer on the beneficial packages available to a new customer. The Labour Party introduced legislation in December 2020 to ensure no existing customer is left at a disadvantage because of new offers available for new customers. That is what is happening in the UK. Will the Minister meet the CRU again in the coming days and impress on it the necessity for every energy customer to be able to avail of those beneficial packages available to new customers? That is a simple request. It is an achievable win for the Government. We would support the Government in that regard.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join with the Tánaiste in congratulating Teresa and wishing Noel and Liam the very best in their new roles. We are led to believe it will be six months until the Government produces a budget. I think the Tánaiste will agree with me that over the course of the pandemic it was proven that when the Government needs to or feels it can intervene in a swift fashion, it can do so. The Tánaiste knows there is a cost of living crisis and we are welcoming refugees from Ukraine who deserve and need our support. Surely the Government must recognise that we cannot wait six months to have a budget. We need an emergency budget. Can he commit to having such a budget between now and the summer? Is it his intention to wait six months? Families cannot wait six months for the type of intervention that is now needed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his contribution. We spoke about this Bill before and I have reflected on his comments earlier today about the nature of Government intervention and universality in reference to free GP care. It is something on which I agree with him. As referenced by other speakers, a previous Government introduced free GP care for children on the basis of universality, on the understanding that members of our society who pay their taxes in that society should feel that everybody should benefit from it, regardless of background or income. It allows everybody to feel as if there is no myth of a squeezed middle, of those who solely benefit and of those who shoulder the famous tax burden. That is why I agree with the Minister's earlier comment on the nature of universality. When we speak about the cost of living, as my colleague, Deputy Bacik, said earlier, we in the Labour Party constantly say that in Ireland there are expenses that are not expenses anywhere else in the Europe or that an average European citizen relocating here would find to be quite unusual. GP care or GP visits are among them. People relocating from the North to the South have to get used the idea of putting a hand in a pocket for a GP visit and other things such as schoolbooks, etc. The ambition from the Government to move to a universal system, something that was achieved by a Government referenced earlier in terms of free GP care for children, is something that will go in tandem with the provisions in this Bill as time moves on. The Minister will know that at the beginning of the pandemic, in September 2020, Senator Sherlock of the Labour Party put forward a Private Members' Bill to recognise that not having a statutory sick pay scheme at the start of a pandemic was a major gap in our legislation. In fairness to the Tánaiste, he acknowledged that at the time and said he would prioritise it. Sure enough, he is true to his word and has produced the goods in the form of this Bill, although we obviously will have issues with it and will want to improve it. ICTU also has paid tribute to the collaborative nature of the process. This is an improved Bill but as others have said, it certainly has a way to go.  It is unfortunate that it appears the Government is ignoring some of the very clear recommendations, made on a cross-party basis, from the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment on certified sick leave and the enormous issues faced by low- and middle-wage workers in paying for and accessing timely GP services. I remind the House that, as stated in an earlier discussion, Ireland has a disproportionately low-pay economy. An OECD statistic showed that 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. In fact, about 40% of younger workers, that is, those aged under 30, are in insecure work. Insecure work leads to insecure accommodation and all sorts of other insecurities. Health insecurity is another issue, and that is why the right to statutory sick pay for those workers is so essential. The reality is that a low-paid worker could end up paying more to a GP than what he or she would get back in terms of 70% of daily pay for being out sick. For a minimum wage worker, that would be a certain reality. The Government is failing to protect and look after workers on the minimum wage. While I appreciate that the Tánaiste has to balance the frustrations or concerns an employer would have, we in the Labour Party feel the most vulnerable person in the transaction would be a low-paid worker who does not ever feel as if he or she has enough power to make his or her case. That is why we are here to make the case for those workers. Unfortunately, the Bill is still a far cry from what the Labour Party proposed in September 2020 on foot of appeals by workers' representatives, on behalf of meat plant and early years workers, in SIPTU and ICTU who sought the provision of a sick pay scheme for all. The Bill does not represent a right to access sick pay from the start of employment. Seasonal workers, early years educators, such as early childhood care and education, ECCE, workers, and others employed for part of the year would be forced to have worked for 13 weeks before they would be entitled paid sick leave. ECCE workers are typically employed on 38-week contracts. Therefore, every September every worker would have to wait 13 weeks before getting paid sick leave. That is not right or fair. As has been referenced, it has been described as a major flaw in the Bill by Patricia King and others in SIPTU, such as Laura Bambrick, who have asked that the word "continuous" be omitted from the Bill. I am quite sure that when we debate Committee and Report Stages of the Bill we can work on that in a collaborative fashion. The Bill fails to ensure that workers will not be out of pocket. The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment recommended that a minimum rate of pay be introduced. From the Government's statement last week, it is not clear that the Bill does that. Serious questions remain about the reluctance of the Government to hardwire into the Bill the provision of ten days of sick leave that is due to be paid in 2025. There are real concerns that the three days the Government will make available from this year will remain at the mercy of ministerial regulation and that is not acceptable. In conclusion, sometimes we in this Oireachtas do our best to be as unco-operative as possible. We often play the role of the pantomime villain but that is not a fair reflection of what genuinely happens in these Houses. The Labour Party made a recommendation to the Government in September 2020. The Government recognised that it needed to be done and is now bringing forward legislation. It is unfortunate that Bill was not introduced before now, when the pandemic appears to a large degree to be over. That said, with goodwill, we are now at a stage where it is to be hoped we can bring it into law. I noted the determination of the Tánaiste to work with Opposition parties to ensure we can have this in place by the middle of the year. I think that is the phrase the Tánaiste used. That kind of energy probably needed to be there from September 2020. If it had been, far more workers could have availed of sick leave provisions as they worked their way through the pandemic. The points I have made in respect of the word "continuous" and low-paid workers remain but the point on which I began is the one on which I will finish. In the context of the current debate on the cost of living, there are certain expenses in Ireland that would be unusual to a person relocating here from another country. In most European countries, and certainly on our neighbouring island, it is considered the role of the state to pay for visits to a general practitioner, GP, and to protect its citizens in that regard. To even have to consider the cost of such a visit, regardless of one's income, is something people in the North or in Britain never do. That is the kind of lesson we have to take from this pandemic. We welcome the fact that the Bill has been brought forward, although it can be improved, and I will certainly work with the Tánaiste on it, but it is only one part of a wider discussion on how we deal with sickness and healthcare, and what the State provides in that regard. The Labour Party will always argue that we need a bigger State, more rights and basic provisions that are available in other jurisdictions. It changes the way people interact with their employer and the State. I agree with the Tánaiste on the ethic and principle of universality, as does the Labour Party, including Senator Sherlock who in September 2020 proposed the Bill that kick-started this debate in the Houses. I again thank the Tánaiste for taking on the legislation and bringing it to this point, but we want to improve it so there is balance for the vulnerable worker rather than always for the employer who is trying to pick holes in the rights of his or her employee.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In relation to the welcome basic income scheme for those in the arts, those in receipt of disability supports are concerned that if they avail of this scheme they will lose supports that are currently available to them. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, shed some light on that for me?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State. I am intrigued by that response. It is quite comprehensive. As the Minister of State was going through it, I was not sure whether we were going to a space where the Minister was working on it. Towards the end of the response, it appeared the Minister of State outlined the Minister is aware of the issue and is working on it but he seemed to indicate that there is not an issue. However, there may be individual cases which the grand sweep of what the Minister is trying to achieve will not cover. I ask the Minister of State to outline to the House that somebody in receipt of disability support will be classed as a self-employed person and on that basis, he or she should not have any concerns about losing whatever supports he or she has. As the Minister of State can appreciate, the arts are about giving license to those who have tensions within their lives to express them and if we are excluding those with disabilities from this scheme, then that will be a major disadvantage, not only for them but for the wider Irish society. I am intrigued to get more detail on the Minister of State's response. It appears to be welcome.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This scheme in general is extremely welcome. There will always be issues, but this is a big one if one is a person with a disability and one is expressing oneself through artistic means and one may be locked out of the scheme. What I am hearing from the Minister of State is that he is aware of this, that he is meeting and engaging, that he is engaging with the Department and that this is going to be resolved both on a wide basis and on an individual basis. If that is the case, those who are listening to this debate will be comforted by that. I want to be absolutely clear that this issue has been recognised, that the Minister is aware of it and is working it out with the Department and those who represent artists with disabilities and that it will be resolved on a project basis and on an individual basis.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach may be aware that the Labour Party is running a campaign demanding a pay rise for Irish workers. The Taoiseach announced that the VAT cut of 9% will remain for the hospitality sector until February 2023. The number of workers in that sector on the minimum wage is three times the national average so it is a low-pay sector. As we constantly remind the Taoiseach, 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. We are the third highest in the OECD when it comes to the proportion of low-paid workers. The Taoiseach should engage with employers and tell them that the payback for continuing with the 9% VAT rate is their engagement with the joint labour committees to ensure their workers are properly paid. We cannot stand over a situation where the Government is gifting employers a 9% VAT rate but they still stand over a system of poverty pay.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I very much appreciate the Minister's attendance and it demonstrates her commitment to this debate. The school development area in my constituency is known as Killester Raheny Clontarf. People familiar with north Dublin know the borders as the Malahide Road, the coast and the Oscar Traynor and Kilbarrack roads. Within the area there are approximately seven second level schools, all of which have religious ethos, four of which are all-girls schools and one of which is an all-boys school. There are two that are mixed, with one having a Church of Ireland ethos and the other having a Catholic ethos. Parents in my constituency are saying there is not a school for them if the children want to attend an Educate Together school, for example, or if they want to choose a non-denominational or multi-denominational school for their children. They do not have one. On the border, on the Malahide Road, there are two other second level schools in Ardscoil Rís and Chanel College, Coolock, which are also all-boys schools. The Minister knows the Department has not given sanction to any new single-gender school since 1998 and it is not the Department's policy to do so. The Department has indicated to the campaign group that the group should engage with each of these schools to see if they are willing, able or at a point in their development of changing their ethos. That is unlikely to happen and it puts the onus back on volunteers to engage with schools, who have enough on their plates without having such a major conversation in the short term. To be honest, I have had this conversation with the Minister's predecessor about another part of my constituency. The initial response from the Department was that the demographics did not justify a new school, but that is where we ended up and it is why there is a second level Educate Together school now in the northern fringe area, as sanctioned by the Department. Will the Department sanction and recognise a new second level Educate Together school in this area? The area's demographics have changed and there are a large number of new young families in the area. My office has never had the number of requests for school places at second level as it has had in recent months. It is now a major issue locally for families trying to access second level places. Seven schools are listed in the area and many of them are difficult to get into in the first instance. One of them has a wider remit or mandate in that it is of Church of Ireland ethos and it accepts children from right across the north side of the city. Living within the catchment area does not necessarily give access to that school and it has a wider remit. We are therefore reduced to six schools, with four being all-girls schools and one being an all-boys school. We must allow a continuum of education with a multi-denominational ethos and parents in the area are very anxious to move to a position where such a choice can be available to them. They should not be forced to send their children to a second level school under an ethos with which they are not comfortable. All these schools correctly say they do everything possible to facilitate children of all backgrounds, but what is best for the children I speak to is a new school with a multi-denominational ethos. It would afford them the choice of having a continuum of education in the manner that best fits their own belief system.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and I appreciate her reply. Again, every area is different. She has said there are seven post-primary schools serving the Killester Raheny Clontarf area, but as I said, four are all-girls schools and one is of a Church of Ireland ethos and has a remit wider than the immediate area for the entirety of north Dublin. It is a particular case. I am encouraged by the Minister's suggestion of an ongoing review. With the campaign group I will look to get as much data and information as possible in engaging with the Department. As I stated, I had a discussion in the Seanad at the time with the Minister's predecessor about the necessity for a multi-denominational school around the northern fringe.At that time, I received a similar answer to this, which was quite negative. However, the school is now up and running. I expect the same thing to happen in this instance. I suggest to the Minister that she reconsider this request in light of the changing demographic of the area, the young families that have come into it and the fact that for those not interested in a Catholic second-level education there is no option. There are seven schools listed. Six of them are Catholic schools and the remaining one is non-Catholic but it has a wider remit across the entirety of north Dublin such that a student is not entitled to enrolment in that school on the basis that he or she lives in the immediate catchment area. I will continue to raise this with the Minister. The campaign group and I will be compiling data to engage with the Department. This is a growing area with young families whose children are going to need second level placements. A relatively new denominational primary school is moving into Killester in September and a number of Educate Together primary schools have also opened in the area in the past number of years. It is unfair to allow children to attend a multi-denominational primary school only for them to be told in sixth class that they have no opportunity to continue in multi-denominational education up to leaving certificate level, that they have to move into a denominational situation. That is unfair to those children and their families.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his response. We appreciate that he is not opposing the Bill but again, our interest is in what that actually means. Many pieces of legislation are brought forward in these Houses that the Government says it will not oppose. It cannot be a passive act, however, and it must work with Opposition to bring this to fruition. I am glad to see that Mr. David Joyce has joined us here today to witness the debate. I want to pay tribute to the party leader, Deputy Bacik, and to my colleague, Deputy Nash, for bringing forward this legislation. We constantly impress upon the Minister of State, and we will keep repeating, that an epidemic of low pay exists in Ireland. When we use language such as "living wage", the whole point of a living wage is that somebody can live. It is spirit crushing to work a long week and not to have enough money to live. There is a big difference in a person's mentality and spirit between being broke and being poor. Broke means it is an inconvenience for a period of time. There is something that a person possibly cannot buy but he or she knows there is an expectation that it will not last that long. Being poor is very different, however. It is spirit crushing. If a child begins to feel it from his or her parent, parents or person in the household who is bringing back that low pay, then that sense of being poor sucks itself into the marrow of the child's bones and lasts a lifetime. He or she cannot and does not shake it and then passes it on to his or her own children. That is what we are talking about when we use phrases like "living wage". It is about the ability to live without that spirit-crushing sense of poverty or being poor. Some 23% of Irish workers are in low pay. I did not believe it until a number of years ago when my colleague, Deputy Nash, told me this figure, and that when it comes to low pay in Ireland, we are the third highest in the OECD in terms of the proportion of Irish workers who are in low pay. Some 40% of workers aged under 30 are also in insecure work. However, let us get back to low pay for a second and its impact on a family. Not only that but there are also things in Irish society that people are expected to pay for that they are not expected to pay for in other European countries such as GP care, schoolbooks and other basic provisions the State would normally provide. In Ireland, therefore, it has an even bigger effect. I heard recently at the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the suggestion of bringing forward legislation on sick pay. It was remarkable to me to hear all the Government Members' response and, indeed, those from members of the Opposition about the position of the employer. We appreciate that but we must again set our mindset to change everything we do to ensure that child does not feel that sense of being poor the rest of his or her life and passes it on to the next generation. That is the game here. It is having an entitlement to pay that lifts a person up to have an ability to live. Testimonies have been sent in from around the country on how low pay affects young people. As my colleague, Deputy Nash, already said, the Government's decision to continue the low rate of VAT until February 2023 is absolutely welcome for the hospitality industry. People working in the industry are three times more likely to be on the minimum wage, however. Where is the deal? Where is the demand from the Government to this industry that is paying its workers so poorly that as a result of getting this VAT cut, they must pay their workers a decent wage that allows them to live? Again, we impress on the Minister of State that the language is so important here. We are not just dealing with minimums; we are dealing with the capacity to live. We are also dealing with that child who cannot feel the weight of the sense of being poor.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is mid-May and the special needs assistant, SNA, allocations have yet to be published. SNAs across the country speak regularly about the lack of respect shown to them by the Department of Education. It is hard not to agree with them when it comes to the middle of May and the allocations for next September are not available. They must plan for their own lives and planning is required for the young people they work with, as well as their schools. Everything is still up in the air in the absence of the publication of the allocations.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be honest with the Minister of State. When I tabled this question last week I assumed the allocations would have been published by the time we discussed it. I do not need to know how many SNAs there are or how good a job they do. I need to know when the allocations will be published by the Minister of State’s Department so SNAs, schools and families can plan for September. It is not good enough to tell me the allocations are always made in May because it is not good enough that they are made in May. The Minister of State is telling me they will be made by the end of the month but second level schools effectively close up at the end of the month. Can the Minister of State give me a definitive date for when these allocations will be published? Can she give a commitment that the allocations will not be made in May next year?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not think the Minister of State is hearing what I am saying. It is not good enough to say the allocation is always made in May. SNAs are telling me it is not good enough and that the same thing happens every year. They cannot plan for September. They are the last group of school workers who are ever thought of. This year, the staff schedule came out in April whereas it has come out in February in previous years. It is not good enough to tell the House this always happens in May and sure that is the way it is. Nor is it good enough to say it is going to happen by the end of this month. I would like to hear some level of regret in the Minister of State’s voice. SNAs waiting for this allocation to come out cannot plan for September because they do now know what their personal situation will be, or what will be the circumstances of the young person or child they will be working with or those of the school, school principal and school community. Can we work towards a scenario where the allocations will not be made in May next year? Can the Minister of State give a date on which the allocations will be released? If an SNA feels disrespected by the Department, he or she will continue to feel disrespected if this happens every single year and the Minister of State shows no ambition to change the position for next year.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The annual State of the Global Climate report provides another damning indictment of our failure to adequately respond to and tackle climate change. Four indicators broke records last year, namely, ocean heat, ocean acidification, greenhouse gas concentrations and sea level rises. We are out of time. We are out of time. However, if we want to avert further damage, we need a just transition that takes people with us. We needed it a long time ago. When the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was passing through the Houses, there was extensive debate on the amendments proposed by the Opposition to strengthen and define exactly what a just transition would mean. Unfortunately, the Minister did not incorporate this principle into the Bill. A just transition is a concept that originates from within the global trade union movement and is central to a labour and social solidarity understanding of climate protection measures. Our transition to decarbonisation must be carried out in a fair and just way that will not adversely impact on those who are most affected by the cost-of-living and energy crises. When I speak of a just transition, I mean the protection and creation of jobs, improved living standards and reduced emissions, protecting our biodiversity and generating new sustainable communities. We need a blueprint for the future and a structured dialogue that is inclusive of all stakeholders. We must ensure that investment to address our climate emissions and to meet our targets takes account of the need to bring people with us and to protect employment and communities. We need a flexible and accessible skills and education system to meet the needs of a net-zero economy and to address inequalities where transitions are occurring. As I said before, improving energy efficiency of the housing stock is an opportunity to do this. Investment to restore peatlands, urban tree planting and woodland management are all ways in which we can action a just transition and ensure that communities are not hit in terms of employment opportunities. The recent controversy regarding turf is a prime example of the work that is needed to deliver a real just transition by addressing energy and security and protecting our bogs. The Labour Party has called for works in the context of retrofitting and energy efficiency measures for those homes that rely on sod turf to be accelerated. That will require financial investment through grant aid. There is no point in telling anyone who cannot afford to upgrade their home or to buy alternative fuels that they must change. The State needs to support them. The Labour Party is in full support of the Just Transition Alliance and of its call for the urgent and immediate establishment of a national commission. Indeed, this is one of the first issues that was raised with the Taoiseach by Deputy Bacik when she became leader of the Labour Party. Apart from informing us of the extension of the contract of the current just transition commissioner until the end of the year, the Taoiseach did not shed any further light on when the commission will be established. What we need to see now is a date for the establishment of the just transition commission and the mandate of the of the commission. It must incorporate International Labour Organisation guidelines and must align with the UN sustainable development goals. When the commission is fully established, we hope the Minister will use the experience gained in other jurisdictions, such as Scotland, Canada, Germany, Spain and New Zealand, to inform its work. The publication of detailed investment proposals and an action plans to deliver projects is necessary. Achieving that will require additional financing. In its most recent budget proposals, the Labour Party called for a doubling of the just transition fund and for increased investment in retrofitting. The midlands is not the only community at risk. We need a more ambitious response from the State. Accountability, implementation targets and transparency on decision-making must be central to the commission. The question of preserving intergenerational solidarity will also be critical to its proposed work, because a younger generation is growing frustrated with the failure of those in charge to address the climate crisis. In Ireland, we have a problem with rising emissions and our emissions are going in the wrong direction. We cannot adequately plan for a just transition without the publication of sectoral emissions ceilings. The Minister of State might confirm when those will be published. We face immense challenges in the areas of transport, agriculture, food production, afforestation and electricity generation, to name just a few. We need to see those ceilings and to get to grips with the challenge. Crucially, we need the State to play a leading role in the energy sector. Why are we not directly financing offshore wind through the ESB and through other semi-States to retain those natural assets in public ownership? I want to conclude on a point at that the Labour Party has made before. Our natural environment has suffered for too long from the impact of unregulated free markets and untrammelled economic growth. We must build an economic and class analysis into our response to the climate crisis, so that we do not see environmental policies in a silo. These cannot exist in a vacuum. We need a State that leads the charge on climate justice, developing a new model of climate-neutral growth through a just transition. That is why we need the commission now. Our economic planning and climate response must be in sync. These are two sides of the same coin. We need a new economy that generates wealth and that also supports emissions reduction. When my colleague, Deputy Bacik, became leader of the Labour Party, she said that in the coming months we will publish a new strategic economic plan for Ireland. It will put a clear emphasis on regional job creation and on a just transition.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will speak to my amendments. We debated this over and back with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on Committee Stage. He said that he would go back and reflect on some of the measures. This element of the Bill is a non-starter for us. We introduced our own sick pay legislation through Private Member's business two years ago. As Deputy Murphy quite rightly said, the pandemic now appears to be mostly over, yet we are still in a situation where we have not legislated for it. As we constantly said in the committee room, in every other EU country that has statutory sick pay, most have free GP care. It is imbalanced to talk purely about sick pay when other elements within society do not stand up in the context of the worker. It was also instructive to me, and I believe to other members of the committee, how much the weight of conversation in the committee room was about the employer, the employer, the employer. That is understandable but we really want to talk about the worker who is sick and who, therefore, feels that he or she has to go to work even when sick. Let us imagine being in that position where you really feel it is going to hurt you so badly in their pocket that you must pretend to be well to go to work. On that basis, we strongly feel that the Minister's intention to go from three to ten days over an ill-defined period is not strong enough. We want to start at ten days with the ambition to go to 30 days, which would be in keeping with a modern, decent republic. This is why we feel so strongly about it. I withdrew my amendments on Committee Stage, as did other colleagues, in order to resubmit them on Report Stage. I intend to press amendment No. 3 to a vote.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will repeat what we said on Committee Stage. Whenever an improvement to the lot of the worker is proposed, the Government always seems to speak of Armageddon and about how difficult it will be for employers and how businesses will fold, etc. Whenever we propose issues such as a basic rate of pay, a living wage or anything in this area we are always told it will place an unreasonable burden on employers, whereas in every other modern European country it is a basic provision. I restate to the Tánaiste that there are basic provisions even on this island. People in the North of the country have free GP care, something that we have not managed to organise for ourselves in the Republic. That is why this is lopsided. We cannot always think solely, as appears to be the contention of the Tánaiste's party and Government, about the burden on the employer. He cited the war in Ukraine and Border issues with Brexit. The sick worker who has to go to work on the basis of having a low-paid job must be at the forefront of everybody's mind. We are living in a country in which 23% of workers are on low pay. That is what has been driving our attempts to rectify the matter. As has been said, it is to the credit of the Government that it is attempting to rectify this issue but this does not go far enough to protect workers who should not feel they should have to go to work when they are unwell in order to feed their children. That is, unfortunately, the scenario.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, to delete lines 23 to 25 and substitute the following:“(2) An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister under section 6.”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Paul Murphy is making a very important point but I cannot hear him.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 17:In page 6, line 27, to delete “3” and substitute “10”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 19:In page 6, line 29, to delete “3” and substitute “10”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 20:In page 6, to delete lines 31 to 35 The amendment seeks to delete the section that gives the Minister 12 months to improve the lot of workers. If it was in the mind of the Minister to move from the stated three days to five days or ten days, it should be open to the Minister to do that within six months and not to have to wait for 12 months. We propose that lines 31 to 35 would be deleted.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We debated this on Committee Stage as well. We feel this is a reasonable position for the Minister to be enabled to improve the situation and not to have to wait 12 months to do so. That is the purpose of the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This provision in the Bill will do more damage than anything else to its potential for success. If I am sick and I am less likely to admit to that because I will get less money and I will be paid less, I will just go to work sick. As has been outlined, it is an expensive business being sick in this country. Not only do people have to pay for a GP visit, because we do not provide that for free, unlike in other countries, there is also the cost of whatever medicines are prescribed. It is not a cheap business being sick in this country. I can see a worker who is struggling to pay the bills deciding to go into work and pretend he or she is well. That is not something any of us wants to see that happening, but that is what will happen. We must go back to where the worker is coming from. I know the Tánaiste talks about the employer, and he is right to focus on the employer as much as we want to focus on the employee. However, if a worker who has bills to pay and children to feed thinks for a second he or she has to go to work even though he or she is sick, then this Bill will have failed. The most problematic part of this Bill is that it will be worth more to the worker to go to work sick than to avail of the provisions within the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 23:In page 7, line 4, after “day” to insert “,which shall be their full daily rate”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This amendment completely misses the disgusting nature of the intent of an employer not to pay sick pay. What kind of employer are we dealing with who would resist paying sick pay for his or her employee? In the original legislation we discussed previously, the penalty of 20 weeks seemed to me to be commensurate with the disgust we should have for such an employer. It is clear, given that the Tánaiste has come to the Chamber to amend it down to four weeks, that somebody from the employer side of things has had his ear or somebody else's. We genuinely believe this is not good enough and will be absolutely opposing the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What are the Minister's plans to reduce the student contribution charge in budget 2023? By how much will it be reduced?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know I am a little bit older than the Minister. I am a child of the 1990s, a time when if a household had two university-age-going children, they may have only been able to send one. As part of the Labour Party's contribution to the Government at the time, half-fees were introduced halfway through my time in university, followed by completely free fees as it was called. Education cost nothing. It was absolutely free. There was zero cost. While the Minister is making all the right noises in terms of the reduction of the contribution charge etc. is it his vision that the cost would be zero? Is it the vision of his new Department or the Government, that in future years we would revert to where we were in the 1990s, that is, of having a zero euro sign beside the expectations of what families will contribute?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was not just an austerity measure; it began increasing from 1997 onwards. As soon as a charge is introduced, it can inevitably be increased. It increased from whatever it was in 1997 to approximately €1,000 within six or seven years. My point is that if the Minister does not have a vision or an absolute of free education at further and third level education, it will always be a measure that will be tinkered with and increased over time. That is the exact experience of the Oireachtas on the initiative of the mid-1990s. While the Minister is making the right noises as to bringing down the contribution charge in the budget, and I understand he cannot make any promises in that regard or debate the budget in advance, I am trying to get to the core of his vision and belief system. Can we work towards a situation in which we return to where we were in the 1990s, which was an awful lot better for every family that had ambitions for their children to better themselves?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That Dáil Éireann shall take note of the Report of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science entitled "Report on the Detailed Scrutiny of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020", copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 4th March, 2022.I doubt that I need all the time allotted. The Minister knows this issue well. I introduced this Bill in November 2020. The Minister did not oppose the amendments to the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 contained in it and asked that Second Stage be taken after 12 months to facilitate her Department doing the requisite evaluation of the impact of what my amendment intended to do. We had deliberations at the joint committee and witnesses appeared from the equality and education spheres who felt that there was no need for the amendment. There was one dissenting voice on the basis that the provision for providing potentially 25% of places to the children or grandchildren of past pupils is rarely used and, therefore, there is no need to omit it from the Act. The question from me and others at the committee was: why does the provision exist if it is never used? The Minister knows how strongly my party, the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I feel about this part of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act. I cannot speak to the genesis, motivations or lobbying behind it, but I know that it was sought by a particular sector of the education field to facilitate certain schools that wanted to keep the royal bloodline succession in their schools by allowing 25% of places to be held over for the children or grandchildren of past pupils. Of course it is discriminatory. A person's parents or grandparents may not have gone to secondary school. It disproportionately affects members of the Traveller community and people who are not from the immediate area and whose parents or grandparents went to primary or secondary school in another area of the country. People who are living in County Kerry who are not originally from Kerry would be affected by this. People who are not from the country would be affected. I was doing research on my own family and it turned out that none of my grandparents went to secondary school, so it would appear that I would have been at a disadvantage if this legislation had been in vogue when I was trying to access second level places back in the day. There is agreement from the Minister and parties across the House that this element of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act is unnecessary, elitist, divisive, and is causing problems. It is not just being utilised by the fee-paying sector, although I suspect it really wanted it. It is used across the board in the non-fee-paying sector too. In certain areas where there is oversubscription and families are trying to access a school place, they find themselves at a disadvantage if they are not from that area, because they did not attend the school themselves. I know the Minister believes that education is the great liberator. It is the one thing that will lift people out of difficult situations and put them onto a new path. The one thing that can bring people through poverty and lift them more than anything else is the beauty and availability of education. I have seen through my life the effect it has had on families and individuals. All barriers that are placed between an individual and access to education need to be rooted out. To place a barrier by allowing more access rights in any situation to somebody whose grandfather or grandmother went to a particular school does violence to the idea of a republic.I think people forget what a republic actually means. It is not the absence of a monarchy. It means that absolutely every single citizen of this State has the same rights and the same opportunities, no matter who their parents or their grandparents were. This amendment of the Act does violence and injustice to that philosophy.  I want to ask the Minister a number of questions. It has been suggested to me that the entirety of the Act should possibly have been directed to the Data Protection Commissioner because it potentially comes under section 36 of the GDPR Act. The Minister might speak to that again at a later point or forward me her Department's opinion on it. The main thing I want to get from today's session is how we can move this to becoming law. It sometimes frustrates Opposition Deputies and I dare say Government backbenchers when they have a piece of legislation they have drafted and crafted in good faith and there is agreement around it, when it comes from a place of decency and equality and they really want to see it get over the line and become law rather than flounder through red tape or whatever. I believe what we are trying to do here is ethical, right and just. We went through the proper process, put it forward for selection in the lottery for Private Member's Bills. It was taken up and debated. The Minister asked that it be delayed for 12 months and it was. It is on Second Stage now. Can the Minister, the Government or those who have influence over these things allow some time to be given in these Houses for this to become law? If it were to happen, it would be a good reflection of what we can achieve together for children in the education system in this place we call a republic. It should not matter who their parents or their grandparents were. Imagine this scenario. A Ukrainian child arrives in this country seeking refuge and then has difficulty accessing a second level place because the person whose father or grandfather went to the school has more of a right than that child has. That would be a preposterous scenario but it is what we have in law. I ask the Minister again, if we are all agreed on this, how can we make it happen?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not know where to start with the Minister's response. I am infuriated by it. The last paragraph, in particular, I find infuriating. I am beginning to wonder why we bother. The Minister asked for 12 months to do what she has just said she now needs to start. I stood here in November 2020 asking her to take seriously that, as a matter of basic equality, somebody's father, grandfather, mother or grandmother should be irrelevant when it comes to education. The Minister asked to be given 12 months. In good faith, we gave her 12 months. What did she do with the 12 months? Now, after the education committee went through hearing after hearing with every expert who came in saying it needed to go, she comes back in and tells me we need another review and more time for another period of school admission cycles. I ask the Minister bluntly why the private school sector clicks its fingers and gets what it wants. Why do representatives of that sector come to the Minister for Education or people close to her and say they want a new admissions Bill to make sure the royal blood line of succession continues in private schools because they want the school ties to remain, because that is what their elitism is based on? It all comes down to money, that is, the money that they have and want to keep in their schools, from the same families. That is the whole point of it. They want 25% of their school places kept over to that money and those families. It should not matter a damn where your da went to school, or if he went. It should not matter a damn where your grandfather went to school, or if he went. This odious legislation containing this odious amendment states you have more rights to admission to a secondary school or primary school based on who your parents or grandparents are. I gave the Minister a year to sort it out and she comes back in and asks for more time and more school admission cycles.  It drives me to distraction to consider the power that the fee-paying lobby has. There is nothing they will not get if they ask for it. Proof is in this legislation. The only ones who asked for it were them. They got it and we cannot move it because we have another review. Not one expert witness came into the committee and said it needed to stay. The only argument for it to stay was that it was rarely used. I am losing faith in this process because I went through the process of producing legislation and hoping it might be selected for debate. I was successful. The Minister asked me to give her a year and I said I would work with her on that. Did I get a phone call from the Department of Education at any point in those 12 months to talk about the admissions Bill? Of course I did not. Did the Minister seek a meeting with me to talk about the Bill in those 12 months? Of course she did not. We went through the facade of the education committee, which I prioritised in my time. The Minister brought in all these experts who prioritised their time to come in and offer their expertise on the basis for inequality which is in this Act. Then we bring it back here on a Thursday evening and the Minister tells me she needs more time and more school admission cycles. Fundamentally, we have here proof that as long as those who want to lobby effectively for legislation to benefit them have deep pockets, it will work. The system will bend over backwards for them and when somebody identifies this as a problem, it will be reviewed to death until, hopefully, the likes of me lose faith. For all the numerous successes I acknowledge the Minister has had in her role, this type of response on this Thursday evening in a pretty vacant Dáil Chamber makes me lose faith. The Minister has no answer as to why it should stay. She has no defence and no argument as to why one child should have a better chance of accessing school because of who their family is than another. It disproportionately hurts Travellers, those whose parents did not go to secondary school, those who do not come from the area and those who do not come from the country, yet it is stuck there in legislation because the private school sector wants it there and we will leave it there rather than use some energy to delete it. My faith in the process is extinguished. The time the Minister is asking for now is the time I assumed she was using in the year she asked from me before this was moved on Second Stage. What was the point? What was the Minister doing in those 12 months? What was going on? Clearly, the Department does not want to change this provision and wants it to remain. Clearly, we think it is in concert and in tune with the ethics, values and vision of a republic that child A from family A has more rights because their father and grandfather went to school than child B, who has none of those advantages. I am exasperated to read a response such as that. I do not know what difference my contribution will make or if it will make any difference. The Minister's response is an insult to me and my efforts, to the committee, to every expert who came into the committee and to the representatives of all the organisations who gave up time to attend the committee and to give presentations and analysis, every one of whom said it needed to go. It is an insult to all of them for the Minister to come in here, having had a year between November 2020 and November 2021 in which clearly the Department did nothing, and to tell me and other Deputies that she needs more time. She wants to review this amendment to death because she, I and Deputy Ó Murchú know that the private school sector gets what it wants when it clicks its fingers. That is fundamentally what this is about. The Minister can have her review but she has lost my goodwill. When anybody asks me again about the potential for Government to work with Opposition to achieve something with ethics at its heart, I will have to tell them I am not sure if I have faith in it any more. You give good faith, and it is not afforded to you in return. You are reviewed and reviewed until you lose your good faith. All we are trying to achieve is that every child has the same opportunity.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It might surprise the Minister of State to hear me be complimentary of the Government's efforts in this field. Many, including me, were unsure as to whether breaking up the Department of Education and establishing a new Department was a good move. However, in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, I think they have made it work. I feel they have placed a large emphasis on the area of apprenticeships and they have done good work in this space in the past two years. When work is done, when systemic issues have been tackled and when new ministerial responsibility has been put around it, that is to be commended. It also means that, when it comes to issues of apprenticeships, higher education and further education, the Department is not swamped with other education issues and it can focus on this. This kind of debate is a testament to that. That is not to say there are not issues that need to be addressed. Apprenticeships in the public sector are long overdue, so that is a positive. The difficulty with the model is that, again, it appears to be employer-led and there is no indication that is necessarily going to change any time soon. I believe councils and local authorities are key to this, including those in my own area, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council. Apprenticeships within councils will be crucial to allowing young people to move into a field of work, and that has to be expanded over the coming period. We also need to build skills for the new green economy. The numbers the Minister of State has outlined look well, but if we scratch the surface of the numbers, 60% of all of those apprenticeships are in two trades. We need to expand the type of apprenticeships we are resourcing. Building skills in the green economy and allowing the public sector to lead the way in apprenticeships and in building capacity is what we need to focus on. The national apprenticeship office looks great but it is far from being fully established because of staffing issues, which is something we need to focus on. It has been said that one of the fallouts from the crash was that developers and the industry prefer to sublet jobs, as opposed to taking on apprentices, because apprenticeship is a four-year commitment. When this area is so employer-led, we tend to make mistakes in that way and we are not allowing the system to be led by the experience of the apprentice. The experience is that in year one of their given craft, an apprentice, for example, a carpenter, can earn as little as €6.84 an hour, with those in year two earning only €10.26 an hour, both of which are below the national minimum wage. I believe the Government has taken this area seriously. The division of the Department was a good move and the fact we are even having this debate is testament to the fact we now have a Minister of State we can talk to in this area when that would not have been possible previously. However, our belief is we need to move to having apprenticeships that are going to serve the green economy, and we need to have it done in such a way that apprenticeships do not have such poor wages, that they are not dominated by the old traditional trades, and that the local authorities are seen as key to future growth in this area.The new national apprenticeship office must be supported to do its work. If there are staffing issues or if it needs more legislative underpinning, we need to address that quickly.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Not agreed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Statements on higher education are planned for Thursday but we only had statements on an area of higher education last Thursday. We need statements on special education. We are not sitting next week and there is a crisis in special education school places across the country. It is the last day of May and SNA allocations have yet to be published. I understand the warehousing plan of the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special education and inclusion has been scrapped. We do not need statements on higher education this Thursday; we need statements on special education and we have written to the Business Committee to seek that. It is important.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is that a "No"?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the Ceann Comhairle was an SNA he would think it was damn necessary to have a debate on special education this week-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----or a parent, or somebody seeking a school place. We will be calling a vote on this issue. We demand statements on special education this Thursday to replace the statements on higher education.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I doubt there is a Deputy in this House who would suggest that statements on higher and further education this Thursday are more pressing than statements on special education.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a particular issue in the country that the Ceann Comhairle will appreciate. The issue is that SNA allocations have yet to be announced and I understand that may happen at 3 p.m. today. School places have still not been found and there is an issue around the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion's dealings with this issue. This week is the week for us to deal with it. There will be no sitting next week and waiting two weeks is just not acceptable to us.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«First, I am disappointed that this is the conversation we are having this afternoon. The Labour Party had asked that we discuss special education. Nobody in the Opposition asked for this debate. We will not have an opportunity for another two weeks to discuss the fact that 270 children do not have a school place for September. Having said that, the issue we are discussing today is an important one. Having listened to the discussion on "Morning Ireland" earlier today, I raise the outrageous situation facing people who have come here from all over the world to learn English. Our reputation has been tarnished by those who would abuse these people in such a disgraceful fashion by putting them in substandard accommodation in makeshift nightclubs and on disused sites. The country's reputation has taken something of a hammering in this regard. One young woman spoke on the radio about how she will tell everybody she knows in Brazil not to come to Ireland to learn English. It is important that the House deals robustly with this issue. We all believe in the power of education and that it is the great leveller. I was a beneficiary of the free fees scheme, as it was known, in the mid-1990s. We no longer have anything like that system. Instead, we have gone backwards. The Minister and I have spoken before about his vision in this regard. He certainly has said all the right things and made all the right noises about bringing down costs for families when a child attends further or higher education. We often refer to the Cassells report. There is a section within the report that advocates the introduction of a capital assets test. When the Minister and I were in government together not so long so, abortion was the only issue that got members of his party in more of a flap than the idea of the potential introduction of a capital assets test for access to the full suite of grants for third level education. We identified individuals with €250,000 in their bank accounts who were able to get the full grant provision for their children. There was a scenario whereby if people could employ the services of an accountant, they could manage to muscle their way into the grant system, which is supposed to facilitate those who most need support to go to college. Of course, the proposal was never adopted because of the heavy lobbying by those who are quite powerful in political circles in Ireland. What is the Minister's view on the introduction of a capital assets test, as advocated for in the Cassells report? It is depressing to hear the Tánaiste speak about tax cuts being the priority for him when it comes to the budgetary cycle. Are we not learning anything about the capacity of the State to do more to bring down the cost of living outside of the tax code? There are basic provisions across Europe and even on this island that people take for granted will be provided free at the point of access. Yes, they pay for them through their taxation system but there is no direct cost. We have spoken about free GP care, free schoolbooks, free third level education and affordable childcare. However, when it comes to the Tánaiste's interaction with the budgetary cycle, he cannot divorce himself from talking about tax cuts. It is utterly depressing. Collectively, the political system - or, more accurately, the Government - has thrown away €500 million. We are all talking about the point on which the Minister opened the debate, which is access for people with autism to third level institutions. There are many issues that are causing massive hurt and pain for people around the country.All these significant issues are causing families distress, but the answer last October was to throw away €0.5 billion. The Tánaiste's idea is still to do something similar in this budgetary cycle, not understanding in any way the difference it would make to a family to have all these educational elements available for free or at least at a cost that would be much more affordable, as is the case across Europe. It is often said that third level education is not everything, that we should not get so obsessed about it and that we should get rid of some of the stigmas attached to other forms of further and higher education. The Minister was correct when he said that. The people who always say this in forums like this or in the media, however, are people who have had a third level education. It is easy to say to a community that a third level education is not everything if one has been a beneficiary of it, passed through the system and has a lifestyle that benefited from that third level education.  I have several important points to put to the Minister. The recommendation in the Cassells report of a capital assets test is a hot political potato, but it is patently unfair that some people are getting grants who should not be. I refer also to the ambition to drive down the registration costs and the costs of attending college, which are forcing some families to make a choice between one of their children going to college or two of their children attending. Then there is the ambition we should have to return to where we were in the 1990s when I attended third level education. It should be free. We cannot accomplish that if the answer to every social ill from the leader of the Minister's party is a tax cut.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Should we thank Fianna Fáil for every tribunal we ever had?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party welcomes this legislation, which is coming from the High Court ruling on court presenters. I am taken by the letter written by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to the Ceann Comhairle. She states that on a single day, 2 June, more than 2,131 cases were before the District Court throughout the country. Notwithstanding contingency measures put in place, hundreds of cases had to be adjourned. In one court alone, 130 cases had to be adjourned, which has caused significant distress and upset to victims and accused persons. These cases will be added to the already lengthy backlog of cases arising from Covid disruption. Clearly, the court presenter system, without any legislative underpinning, was holding the District Court system together. If it is struck down by the High Court, the legislative body of the Oireachtas then needs to act. The Government is acting and we support that action. I do not necessarily agree, however, with the Minister's suggestion that delays are purely down to Covid. Anybody who works in the system will attest to the fact there is a lack of judges. That has to be addressed. It is part of the issue that is leading to such delays in our District Court system. It is slightly alarming that a ruling like this can shine a light on a practice that is holding the District Court system together and maintain that it does not have legislative underpinning. Are the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice analysing our systems so there is no other issue that may come to light in future that could be struck down by the High Court? It is important there is robust analysis of how our system of justice operates. If something so fundamental to how a case proceeds through a District Court process can be identified by a High Court judge as not having legislative underpinning, is there anything else? As a result of this judgment, is the Government, the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice or any agency conducting a robust analysis of how the District Court operates so that we do not find ourselves in this situation again? It does not reflect well on us as an Oireachtas that such legislation has to come before us without pre-legislative scrutiny and has to be rushed through the Houses so quickly. If someone is in front of a District Court, this may be his or her only chance to get a level of justice, be that person an accused person or somebody on the other side of the issue. It would cause me and, I am sure, the Minister and the Government, disquiet that such a fundamental element of how this is run could be deemed to be without a legislative underpinning. The lack of judges is part of the problem. We need a robust analysis of how our District Court system is operating. I am heartened by the words of Deputy Ó Murchú when he speaks to how drug offences are dealt with. I feel that across the Oireachtas we have potential for great change here. As the Deputy said, there is a citizens' assembly due in the new year on the issue of drugs. Those who work in this area know a massive number of the drug possession cases that have come before our courts do not need to be there at all. Some 70% of drug cases are for possession for personal use. The vast majority of cases are against people who are addicted to something or who use something. In other jurisdictions, they are funnelled through a very different path. We talk about harm reduction and using the health system primarily, not the courts system. If the Minister takes a trip to the drug court, which has a certain level of success, she will observe a courtroom full of sick people. They should not be sitting in a courtroom looking at a judge. Those who have an addiction fundamentally do not belong in a courtroom interacting with the criminal justice system, gardaí and judges. That is not where they should be. The citizens' assembly, as indicated by Deputy Ó Murchú, is the right forum for us to analyse properly how other jurisdictions are dealing with this issue. I refer to Portugal and various states in America. We should take issues of personal use and addiction out of our courts system. They do not belong there. We need to find another mechanism for dealing with them. If we were to do that, we would free up a lot of court time and Garda time that could be spent tackling the pushers, the gangs and the industry rather than the victims, who are the ones inevitably in front of the courts. We appreciate the Government had to act and is acting. The Minister is bringing forward legislation without pre-legislative scrutiny because there is a time issue and that is fair enough. However, the Government has to recognise that if a High Court judge has struck down something so fundamental to the operation of our courts system, what else is there? What else could there be? Are there other legal loopholes that need to be strengthened so we do not find ourselves in this position again? If we are back here again in six months' time because a High Court judge sees something else that does not have a legal underpinning, it is not going to reflect well on us at all. On the day-to-day operation of a court, I encourage the Minister to go down to the drug court or any court. For any Member of the Oireachtas or member of the public who is not familiar with what happens there, whenever I have taken the opportunity to witness it at first hand, it is really striking how those who are in the accused position need an awful lot more help, compassion, understanding, medical intervention and counselling than is being afforded to them. Many of these cases could be dealt with in a very different way. Other jurisdictions that have dealt with it in a different way have seen the number of drug cases and overdoses collapse. They have seen the number of people in heroin dependency programmes collapse as well. That is my main point. Let us not be here again because of something else we overlooked. Let us deal with the lack of judges, because it is leading to delays within the courts system.If we have the opportunity and if there is goodwill, as Deputy Ó Murchú indicated, across the parties in this House to deal with the issue of drug offences differently, we will have a radically reformed courts system and a much better way to empower somebody with a drug use or addiction issue. As any observer knows, the last person to whom somebody with a drug use or addiction issue needs to be talking is a garda or judge. I will leave it at that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire for tabling the motion. It is important that we reflect on the life of a family with a child with autism, the news of a diagnosis, the challenge of it and getting used to it. They then have to deal with the system and the long waiting lists for assessment and interventions. It can take 36 months in some cases. I have been dealing with families who have been affected by this issue for approximately three years. Let us imagine if one had to deal with the challenge of this diagnosis, the new reality of waiting lists and trying to balance that situation in a family, only to come face-to-face with the education system when trying to enrol a child in the local school and having the school say "No". Imagine how that family or those parents would immediately come to the conclusion that their child was a second-class citizen, because the local school has said "No". The SENO will provide a list of schools to the parents and wish them the best of luck, then tell them they can get home tuition if it does not work. Who among us is qualified to invite someone we do not know into our home to teach their child as a substitute for their child going to the local school? Can people imagine the humiliation of having to chase down school after school and having them all say "No"? Parents have come to me saying they have chased down 17 schools that have all said "No".On the list that was given to a woman in Donaghmede by the special educational needs organiser, SENO, there was a school in Drogheda. Already we have hundreds of parents around the country who feel that they and their children are second-class citizens. I want the Minister to cast her mind back to 18 months ago when we were in the Convention Centre Dublin and we had a discussion about the reopening of schools in January 2021. The Minister did her absolute best to present herself as a champion of children with special educational needs and their parents by pitting parents against school communities. I challenged her by saying she was suggesting to us we have to pick a side. The Minister for Education said she did pick a side, that of young people and children with special educational needs and their parents. That is exactly what the Minister said. Fast-forward 18 months, we are now in June 2022 and again we have no solutions to the reality of what these families are facing. When it suits the Ministers, they can be on the side of children and families who are facing issues of school placement. When it does not suit them, they have to go through Twitter threads because they know there is a "Prime Time Investigates" programme coming or they are embarrassed by a child from Tipperary who has to fundraise for her brothers. They came up with a proposal that is so obnoxious and odious to the rights-based approach of children with special educational needs that it should have been followed by a resignation letter from the Minister with responsibility for special education. There are temperate, mild-mannered lobby groups and NGOs working in this system and area all the time that are horrified by the warehousing that is effectively a direct provision approach to special educational needs. It is as if the Ministers are stunned we are in the month of June because they could not predict it. Allied to this is the fact those who work most intensively in this area, our special needs assistants, SNAs, have the ignominy of being told on the very last day of May whether they have jobs for September. I am exhausted listening to parents who are telling me their life stories, and I do not have to deal with it day to day. I cannot imagine the exhaustion of somebody who is dealing with challenging parenting and who then has to deal with agencies of the State that effectively make them and their child feel worthless. I and other Deputies deal with campaigning groups from all over the country. They have to become campaigning groups. If they were to deal with the State on a one-to-one basis, they would not get anywhere. Unless they become a campaigning group or a full-time campaigner, they are wasting their time. Unless they expose the privacy of their family life to television cameras and go on "Prime Time Investigates", nothing is going to change. They must have the campaigning zeal of a child in Tipperary who sees that what is happening to her brothers is not fair or just and has to embarrass the Government into meeting her. That is the only thing that seems to make a difference. It does not come from an inherent sense of equality or justice within Government. It does not come from an inherent sense of equality or justice on the part of the Ministers. What it comes from is a fire-fighting response to an emergency need. I cannot imagine the rage I would feel if I approached the local school in my community with my child whom I have struggled to convince that he or she is an equal citizen in this Republic, and for the local school to say "No". The Ministers cannot at this late stage tell us they have grand plans for section 37A. It has been utilised twice. One of those cases is still stuck in the courts. As has been said, it takes a long time to expedite. The Ministers could have been reforming section 37A for the past 18 months since they made their grand gesture in the convention centre about how strongly they feel about special needs education, special needs students and their families. They did not. When they had a chance to use it as a wedge against teachers and SNAs on the reopening of schools, it was convenient for them. What actually needed to take place to provide school places for those who need them just did not happen. As has been said by the proposers of the motion, the Minister needs to take action on section 37A and we will support that. We supported emergency legislation earlier today. We will support any amount of time the Minister wants to put forward on section 37A to demand of a school to open up for a child who needs a place and then to resource that school. I am quite sure there are school principals and communities who are not sure they would get the support of the State if they did go down that road. Immediately tonight, the Ministers must end this warehousing proposal. They must make a statement that it was a bad idea, ill-conceived and poorly thought out. It has caused a lot of hurt and upset and it is not going anywhere. The Ministers should make that statement tonight. They must absolutely commit to the ethic of a local school place for a child in that community. They must commit to doing anything they possibly can to ensure that right. They should commit that we will not be back here in six or 12 months' time having the very same debate because it does not suit the Ministers, who are utilising this issue as a wedge to drive between parents, school communities and children with special educational needs.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State knows we already had a debate on many of these issues on Tuesday night. I will expand my comments to address some of the issues within the system. The Minister of State will know that not every school is the same. As has been mentioned, there are a cohort of students in some schools who are particularly vulnerable and needy. There may be intergenerational educational disadvantage and addiction issues, in addition to higher proportions of Traveller children, migrant children, children who have just arrived from Ukraine and Roma children as well as a variety of issues with which the school has to deal. Within that school there can also be a higher proportion of children who are under the 30th percentile, so all these allocated resources that will be afforded to the Minister of State will be used in that way to deal with the scenario in front of her in the best way she can. There may be a child in that scenario who may be in the 50th percentile but could be in the 90th percentile with certain appropriate interventions. However, a different school may have the scenario, and I know this to be true, of the lowest performing child in reading capability in that school being at the 88th percentile, yet that child will get resources due to the baseline resources all schools get. This is something social inclusion policy and the NCSE need to address properly. As I said, the child who is at the 50th percentile could be at the 90th percentile. The difference that intervention could make in that child's life over the course of his or her life could be so fundamental and life transforming, but the resources of one school mean it cannot afford to benefit that child because there are so many other needs in that school, whereas that very same scenario would be addressed in a different school. We must not just have a baseline of support for every school but a baseline of support for every child, if we recognise that the intervention of jumping from the 50th to the 90th percentile would make a massive difference in that child's life. As the Minister of State knows, we have an education system that is based on choice, which means competition. When we have competition, in effect, we have a system in which some schools, unfortunately, have a greater level of disadvantage than others. The role of the special educational needs co-ordinator, SENCo, in the school system needs to be better supported. It almost needs to have the same sort of status within the school as that of a careers guidance teacher. The number of agencies SENCos deal with, the amount of timetabling they have to do, the phone calls they have to make, and the assessments on which they have to follow up are quite onerous. If we were to support that position more, we would have a situation in schools where resources would be better allocated and much more streamlined. We would not have the scenario, as has been explained to me, of paperwork clogging up basic applications for laptops, which can sometimes take three to four months to be processed. All these types of things are the daily grind for people in this position. Nobody in the Minister of State's position, or in the NCSE or the Department of the Education, wants to deny somebody the resources they deserve. As I said, the SENCo positions need to be properly recognised. As has been mentioned, we keep coming back to the discussion about SNAs. It is still regarded by the Department as a short-term scheme 20 years on.The question of recognising SNAs' qualifications and so on goes directly to the lack of respect that SNAs feel they are getting from the Department. This all feeds into the narrative. Every year, we discuss the need for SNA allocations to be made much earlier. We have spoken about how late they were made this year. We need to recognise the SNA position as being more than just part of a scheme and instead as being a career. The lack of recognition that their position gets goes to the heart of the insecurity that SNAs feel. The Minister of State can point to the increased number of SNAs in the system, and that number is to her credit, but a school told me today about 54 students accessing six SNAs. If I remember my maths correctly, six into 54 is nine. That is nine students accessing one SNA. How could any SNA do that job effectively? Much of this has to do with how we have the largest class sizes in Europe. How can an SNA deal with the variety of educational needs in a class effectively when so many of the duties of an SNA dip into the educational area because the class is so large, the needs are so great and the teacher can only do so much? What the SNA is trained to do and is charged with doing dips into other areas because of the workload in the classroom. I understand that there are approximately 5,000 deaf children or children with hearing loss in the system. Their advocates are telling me that there needs to be greater awareness among, and training for, teachers and SNAs who are dealing with children who are deaf, hard of hearing or suffering hearing loss, given that the children are not performing as their peers are performing. That is not because of any academic failing on the children's part, but because there is no support, awareness or teacher empowerment. The Department could address this matter. We are still being governed by the five-year-old circular 13/2017. Principals have told me that they find it challenging that only children who are in treatment programmes with disability teams can get resources allocated to them in school. However, if a child has been diagnosed and is awaiting treatment from a disability team, the child cannot get resources in school. I would be interested in the Minister of State's view on this matter. As was stated on Tuesday and again today, data are necessary. This is where the challenge lies for the NCSE. I met Mr. John Kearney, its new CEO. I appreciate his dynamism and new approach to finding solutions. However, the NCSE would be better served if it had more data and greater recognition of the level of need on a regional basis so that we were not firefighting every year and could project five years or ten years hence. Neither the Minister of State nor many members of the Opposition want to be here every June having the same argument about, or experiencing the same frustrations with, school places. What comes to my mind in this debate is the word “insecurity”. As I mentioned on Tuesday, if a family is trying to grapple with a child’s diagnosis, there is insecurity about knowing when the assessment, intervention, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy will happen and insecurity about whether the child will get a school place. There is insecurity among those working in the system about whether they will be able to empower the child properly. There is insecurity about the career path of the SNA. There is insecurity for the person charged with overseeing all of this within the school system about whether there will be time and space within the school diary to do it, given the various overlapping agencies that he or she must contend with every day of the week. It is challenging. Every school deserves resources and I am not in any way suggesting that schools do not. Fair play to the private schools for opening up to other children - I am delighted about that. However, where schools in intense disadvantage are concerned, the children attending them who are not in the siren zone – they are in the extremely vulnerable position of being under the 30th percentile and are progressing okay but could be progressing much better - are deserving of help as much as a middle class child is. This is a challenge for us. The Minister of State will agree that we can find solutions to it, but they must be socially inclusive and we need to work hand in glove with the NCSE on finding them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My amendments are Nos. 14, 15, 17, 18 and 50. Amendment No. 14 states, under the broad heading of "Academic freedom", that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying or restricting the principle of academic freedom as provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997.” Amendment No. 15 inserts on page 16 between lines 3 and 4 "support and recognise the application of the principle of academic freedom", and we feel strongly that the principle of academic freedom needs to be implicit throughout the Bill. Amendment No. 17 attempts on page 17, line 4 after "frameworks" to insert “support the autonomy [as has been said previously] and decision-making capacity of designated institutions of higher education". Amendment No. 18 is to insert the line "to freely express its views on matters concerning the higher education sector". The principle of autonomy and academic freedom is central to what we are trying to achieve in the language we want to insert in the Bill. We spoke a lot about this on Committee Stage, where, as the Minister said, we had a progressive and constructive interchange. Amendment No. 50 inserts:(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting an interference with the autonomous capacity of each designated institution of higher education to determine— (a) which courses and programmes it develops and maintains, or(b) the number of students that will be accommodated on any course or programme or within each designated institution of higher education.”.Again, the autonomy of individual institutions and academic freedom are the main points in all those amendments. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the point the Minister makes on amendment No. 18. There is nothing in the Bill that precludes an institution expressing its view but we are trying to say here that having it explicitly referenced in the Bill gives more cover to somebody who was minded to express their views.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support the amendment. The point about teacher training is well made. Most teachers are now trained by a private online training college, which is owned by a book company. The Minister was in my part of the world not long ago at the Marino Institute of Education. When we are trying to change the nature of teaching and teachers, ensure the teaching profession is reflective of the children being taught and encourage those from different backgrounds, including disadvantaged, Traveller, migrant and disability backgrounds, to provide that public service remit, having most of our teachers coming from a college outside of the public sphere is not something we should welcome. The amendment tabled by Deputy Conway-Walsh is deserving of support.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will address amendment No. 19. We suggest that, between lines 9 and 10 of page 17, it be included that one of the functions of an tÚdarás shall be to "advise the Minister in relation to the adequacy of the level of public funding that is made available for higher education and to advise on future funding requirements". All of these amendments are on a similar theme. Amendment No. 33 speaks to the same thing and proposes to insert "the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education". Amendment No. 42, which is also in this grouping, is similar and refers to "the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education". They are all on funding, which has been the subject of the overarching debate we have had over many years since the Cassells report and before it. The public funding of higher education is absolutely key and the Bill has to reflect that. That is why we have proposed these three amendments. If passed, an tÚdarás would have a function in this area. The other amendments speak to that issue as well.

Amendment No. 67 would seek to insert "or the adequacy of any explanation for non-compliance provided pursuant to section 139(7)*”. Amendment No. 96 is in a similar vein and seeks to insert "in order to enable the provision of an adequate explanation for any non-compliance". Again, non-compliance cannot be something passive. It must be accounted for. Amendment No. 102 seeks to insert "in order to enable the provision of an adequate explanation for any non-compliance". Amendments Nos. 139 to 141, inclusive, seek to insert "Where a designated institution of higher education departs from guidelines, codes or policies prepared under subsection (1), the designated institution of higher education shall be afforded an opportunity to provide an explanation" with regard to the parts of the guidelines, codes or policies it departs from.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for an autism strategy to be prepared and published, and to provide for related matters. It gives me great pleasure to stand in Dáil Éireann alongside my party leader, Deputy Bacik, to introduce the Autism Bill 2022. In April 2021, the Labour Party tabled a motion calling for a national autism strategy but over a year later, in June 2022, we are still hearing stories of a lack of school places, of a 36-month wait for assessments and basic interventions, of concerns about dental care, mental health services and employment opportunities for children and young people who have autism. It is time for us, as a party, to move on from the motion that was passed in April last year and to produce legislation that underpins the responsibility of the Government to produce a national autism strategy. Our Bill is based on similar legislation in Northern Ireland that was enacted in 2011 and on the English Autism Act 2009.  Our Bill obliges the Government to produce a cross-departmental autism strategy and requires all other relevant Ministers and public bodies to co-operate with its implementation. The strategy must outline how the needs of people with autism, in terms of access to education, other public services, employment and social inclusion can be met by public service providers. It must include an emphasis on how the needs of families and carers can be met by setting out a roadmap of actions for the development and improvement of family support services. The Minister shall be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the strategy by all of the Ministers and public bodies. Each relevant Minister and public body must publish a progress report on a three-yearly basis, which gives updates on implementation of the strategy.  Our Bill states that the strategy must provide for public service providers to set up data collection systems to identify and record the number of persons within their client bases who have autism and to calculate current and future needs for services. As was outlined earlier today, the fact that we will need school places for young people with autism is completely predictable. We cannot allow the scandal to persist whereby 268 young people with autism do not know, in June 2022, whether they will have a school place in September, not to mention the 15,500 young people who have to leave their own catchment area in order to access a school place.  Under the strategy, the Minister must establish a public autism awareness campaign. This is not just for those who have autism and their families. Every single member of this Republic must be part of the strategy and part of the solution. Provision must be made for autism awareness training for persons in the public service who frequently deal with adults with autism. The Minister must commission research into the prevalence of autism in the State, including among adults, and into the levels of need. A pathway of care must be developed which clearly maps services for adults with autism, aimed at ensuring the consistent availability of those services across the State. The strategy must also provide for the development of a range of services to address the needs of adults with autism, including in healthcare, education, employment and social inclusion throughout their lives. I recall being involved in the development of a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities but no Department wanted to deal with it. The then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection did not want it because it related to disabilities. The Department of Health did not want it because it said it related to employment. In the end, it landed into the Department of Justice.  There must be a best practice model of service delivery, assessment, diagnosis and intervention for service users with autism drawing on international expertise and guidance to health service providers on how to meet the needs of adults with autism, their families and carers. There must also be a detailed examination of the needs of families and carers and how these are to be met by developing and providing appropriate support services. There must be a clear system of accountability, a word that comes up again and again, and scrutiny in relation to autism service provision, to be overseen by the Minister. The Minister must keep the autism strategy under review and must publish a revised strategy at intervals of no more than seven years. We are seeking a legislative underpinning of these rights. We need solution-driven policy and legislation. The people of Ireland who have autism in their families deserve no less. The same is true of every other citizen of the country. We need to do what has been done in Northern Ireland and England and provide a legislative basis for an autism Act in 2022.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was really uplifted by the Minister's remarks and his contribution to the debate. As has been said, debates in this House can often be quite negative and a lot of points can be scored, but the Minister's contribution has challenged us all to point to positives. We can point to a lot of negatives. We have to do that and to point to challenges. Only two weeks ago, however, I brought my four-year-old daughter into the Dublin Pride shop and we decked her out. We got her a flag and a t-shirt for the Pride march on Saturday. I was reflecting on the fact that that just would have been absolutely impossible when I was her age. Like Deputy Funchion, I do not consider myself to be that old, but when we engage with our children we realise how old we are. When I was her age, only a few years later Declan Flynn would be murdered in Fairview Park. That was 40 years ago, when a homosexual act, as it was then called, was a criminal offence. We decriminalised homosexuality only in 1993. We had a dedication on Sunday to Mervyn Taylor, who was a bastion of equality rights, including LGBT+ rights, in these Houses. I think of my daughter and think of young people, as has been described. I often observe young people as they walk together in a very different Ireland from that of the kind of teenage walking I used to do. The background of one or two of their party may be of a different country. They celebrate that and are engaged in that much more than in the very dull, pasty-white Ireland in which I grew up. One or two of their number may be from the LGBT+ community. That is what they know to be right, normal and celebrated. They are ready to defend those rights, and that is something I find so refreshing of that generation, which has handed this to us and are handing it to my child. Whatever happens to my child, whoever she may be and whomever she may love will be defended by those young people, more so, perhaps, than by people of my generation, who grew up in the schoolroom of homophobic jokes and in a system and an Ireland that were quite oppressive. Then we see across Europe, as the Minister said, in Russia, Hungary and Poland, and in various individual states of the United States, what they are trying to do to books, statements and legislation. We see troubling conversations happening in the UK and then we see them in this country. We all have to take note of the fact that, as the Minister said, a person's existence is not up for debate and that punching down on a community that suffers higher levels of mental ill health and suicide just is not good enough. This month we have an opportunity to call that out. Being a member of the LGBT community is different from facing other inequalities. If you are a member of the Travelling community, you share that burden with your family. You can go home to the bosom of your family to discuss or share the inequality or discrimination you have suffered and you can plough through life together. If you are a member of another minority group, perhaps a migrant group, you may be able to share that burden sometimes with your family. If, however, you are a member of the LGBT community, that is sometimes a very private discomfort or a very private hell, and possibly the worst thing you can do in your own mind is to be honest about who you are to your own family. Imagine the fear of rejection from your own family. That is a fear I cannot even contemplate, that you would be who you are to your family and be rejected by your own family. Sometimes we have to reflect on how big a fear that is today for young Irish people, but it is young Irish people who are dispelling and challenging that and fighting back against it. The Minister referred to the hate crime legislation which is coming down the tracks. I greatly appreciate that because we have been campaigning for that for quite a long time. When we see what happened in Sligo, there is a marked difference, as the Minister will know, between hate-based or hate-motivated crime and other crimes. My colleague, Deputy Nash, asked me to impress on the Minister the need for a commitment from the Department of Justice as to when it will start public consultation on the dispensing of convictions of men who were prosecuted pre-1993. That was the second element of the 2017 Labour Party legislation which led to the State apology marking the 25th anniversary of decriminalisation. I will say this much about the educational system, and I know people across these Houses will agree with me. Education is one of our biggest challenges, as is the elephant in the room of the dominance of the influence of entities that are hostile to this agenda. We cannot pretend that that does not exist or that our education system is not still dominated by the influence of patron bodies that are hostile to this agenda. Within the school system there absolutely are schools that stand on their own two feet, that will promote Pride Month, that will speak about LGBT rights and that want to stamp out homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying. We will have to come, however, to a pinch point in the advancement of our Republic and of our democracy in that it is not sustainable for us to have 90% of the primary schools of this country under the patronage of bodies that are hostile to the agenda with which we in this House all agree. How can we have a scenario in which all the parties represented in this Dáil, the representatives of which are directly elected by the people, are, I believe, in concert with this agenda, with the people of the country themselves amending the Constitution in 2015 in order to afford equal rights, including equal marriage rights and equal constitutional protection, to families, yet so many of our schools and so many of our minds can still be influenced by patron bodies that are hostile to this agenda?It is not just about Pride month but it is about every day of the life of a young LGBTQI+ person and if they are attending such a school, we are going to have to deal with that scenario. I was involved in the amendment of section 37 of the Employment Equality Act, that the employment rights of an employee in a State-funded institution had to be protected, even if they were perceived to be undermining the ethos of the school or the health institution in which that person was employed. We could not delete that section of the Employment Equality Act because the patron bodies, constitutionally, still had the right to uphold their ethos. The very existence or the way of living their lives of those who were LGBTQI+, who were unmarried parents, or were divorced, was being undermined because of the fact they were teachers. We had a situation only a number of years ago where the INTO LGBT+ teachers' group was asked to stand in a photograph in Áras an Uachtaráin with President Michael D. Higgins. Half of the teachers left the photograph because they did not want to be photographed and to be clearly identifiable as LGBTQI+ because they could not be fully convinced or sure that their employment prospects would not be inhibited by the fact they were in a photograph with the President of this country advocating for the rights of LGBTQI+ teachers. That is a climate of fear. While we amended the section of the Employment Equality Act, we have to go much further. Let me not finish, however, on a note of negativity but on one of love. I was greatly taken by the contribution of Deputy Martin Kenny when he spoke of our collective humanity. What really connects us as human beings is this search and need for love. Some people find it and some do not. If one finds it and is able to express it, it is the most wondrous thing. Pride is all about love. As I said earlier, I cannot wait to bring my little four-year-old to the Pride march on Saturday and for it to be the most normal thing in the world. I cannot wait for me to explain to her what it is all about.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Stop blaming the DEIS principals.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am sharing time with Deputy Bacik. Deputies Bacik, Nash, Duncan Smith and I have just come from a briefing with parents who live with autism every day of their lives. Once again, they told their stories of how they are trying to manage the system. As a result of that briefing and other discussions I and my colleagues have had, I feel a new onerous sense of great responsibility to bring their experiences to the House. They are in the Visitors Gallery. We welcome them and we want them to be part of the solution. We bring forward this Bill in good faith. We want it to be enacted into law. We want the children, young people and adults with autism in Ireland to have what their counterparts take for granted in Northern Ireland under its Autism Act 2011, what they have in England under its Autism Act 2009, and what they have in Malta under its autism empowerment strategy. We want a national autism strategy in Ireland. The Labour Party brought forward a motion in April 2021 seeking a national autism strategy. We now find ourselves in June 2022 with a discussion, debate and controversy on the basic provision of school places for children. It is still a topic of debate. That shames us all. If any child is having a difficulty accessing a school place because he or she has autism, that is a disgrace. It is a disgrace to our Republic. We use the word "republic" a great deal and we speak about republicanism and living in a republic, but you cannot feel you are living in a republic if your child is refused a school place because of who the child is. We have been working on this for quite a period of time. It does not just come down to education. It comes down to health as well. We listened to what the parents said earlier in our briefing. They are wondering where the ambition and vision are, why we are losing the massive potential of the cohort of young people and adults who have autism, why parents are turning into de facto campaigners, why they are beginning to accept a waiting list of 36 months for basic assessments or interventions and why they have to accept going from school to school to try to access a school place for their children. We heard today that one woman had to travel to 25 schools to try to get a school place for her child. We do not often hear of these cases because parents are so exhausted. They feel they are going through this by themselves and they find they do not have the time to reach out to other networks or to engage with the political system. They have come to the conclusion they are second-class citizens and they have to go with that. Then there comes the crunch point where they decide to fight back. However, they should not have to fight back. They should not have to engage in the political system to point to 36 months of a waiting list being wrong, the lack of provision of a school place being wrong, the fact employment opportunities are so low, the fact Departments do not talk to each other, and the fact we do not have national strategies in Ireland as other jurisdictions have or the basic provision of having health and education plans working together for young people. It is about having ambition and a vision. What we are trying to do in our legislation is provide that vision and ambition. This debate is crippling and crushing, and it does not have to be this way. I have to turn to the controversy over last weekend centred on the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, and her comments on national radio. This is not the first time this Minister of State has let us all down. It is absolutely outrageous that a Minister of State would name four schools as being the problem or insinuate they are the problem. There is a problem with accessing school places. We know 15,000 children and young people move outside their school catchment areas to access school places elsewhere. Some of the school places that are accessed are based on reduced timetables, and a substantial number of young people in school are not being properly cared for or empowered by their school placement. In addition, we were dealing with 268 cases of young people who could not get secondary school places until recently. I met the families in Dublin 15 and I know the families in my constituency. Rather than accept that as a problem to which we all must find a solution, we first had the warehousing proposal, effectively a direct provision proposal for children with special educational needs. Then the Minister of State decided at the weekend to isolate and name four DEIS schools as the problem, all of which are engaging with the system and with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. One of them had a site visit by the Department of Education on the previous Wednesday.The Minister of State has not even bothered to apologise for her misinformation and mischaracterisation of these four DEIS schools. Maybe she is completely unaware of what a DEIS school does or how it serves the community around it, but there are challenges within those schools I am quite sure she has not got a clue about in her constituency. For her to name and shame those schools, and to shift her responsibility and that of the Government for that, was very regrettable. The Government has to account for that, apologise for it and never do it again. On the wider issue, and in trying to be positive and trying to find vision, there is common cause in these Houses between the Government and the Opposition. I do not think anybody in the Government believes it is good enough to have a 36-month waiting list for an assessment or intervention. There is nobody in the Government who believes it is good enough that somebody would be restricted from a school place, yet it keeps on happening. We have to raise the level of ambition and vision and move from a situation where we are firefighting all the time to one where we recast our brains and attitudes fundamentally and look at every child in this country as an integral part of this Republic, without an asterisk beside that child because he or she has autism. That seems to be the prevailing sense we get from different Departments on how we deal with, empower and enhance this, and how we make it better. Children with autism are a valued and integral part of this Republic, so why are we sticking them on waiting lists? Why are we saying "No" to them when they try to access school places? Why are there so many barriers when they go into or try to enter the workplace? Why are there so few people in the public service or the private sector who understand autism? How many Deputies on these benches really understand autism as parents do? How many people working in our school system, the HSE, supermarkets or the transport service understand autism? How many of us fundamentally understand what we have to do collectively as a Republic to lift this experience? I do not think we do. I know I do not know enough. We all have to tool up. We can have a national autism strategy, which we need. We want it to be legislated for, we want it to be the same as it is in other jurisdictions, and we want to lift the experience of parents. We do not want them to become full-time campaigners anymore. We want them to feel differently about the Republic in which they live. We want them to close the door at night and say their interactions with the State, HSE and education system were positive and that their child is cared for, loved, safe and part of this Republic, but they do not feel like that. It is not just about legislation, strategies and political bun fighting on the last week of the school term over school places in September, and emergency legislation being rammed through the House on Friday. We need collectively to change all our attitudes and fundamentally cherish all the children of this Republic equally. That is why this issue is so important.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation, which the Labour Party welcomes. I will first deal with the Ukrainian situation. In fairness to the Ministers who are present, they have worked hard to listen about the fall gaps for those who are trying to live lives here and who are trying to get accommodation and employment here. They have picked through all those issues and come up with solutions. As has been said, this has been a massive effort across all Departments and across society. We often criticise the political system and we are often very self-critical in Ireland, but we have to take a moment to realise we probably stand alone in Europe as being the only country that does not have immigration at the top of the political debate list. We do not discuss it. It is not a political debating point. It never comes up at elections. There is no political entity here that wants to score points over immigration. We should seize that, recognise it and not be complacent about it. It is something that gives us all credit. As far I know in my political time, there has been no voice here that has sought to limit numbers or sought to create division. That is outside of the referendum in 2004, which I considered a dark period. It is almost 20 years from that and it is to our credit in Ireland that when it comes to our moral and historical obligation to open our doors, our families and our communities, we step up and it is not a point of political debate. However, the point has been made about ensuring we do this correctly and ensuring those who have come to Ireland seeking asylum do not feel there is an injustice in how they are being treated compared with the programme refugees we have from Ukraine. There have been suggestions that in the education system, for example, it is easier to access language supports for Ukrainians than for other children in the system. That is something we have to guard against. All the practical measures the Government has taken here, ranging from the €400 in respect of accommodation to drivers' licences and childcare provision, are absolutely necessary. The Government has responded to the issues and is producing legislation to give legislative underpinning for these things. That is to be commended and the Labour Party supports the Ministers on that. Regarding the Stardust, I do not think anybody could imagine, and people still cannot get their heads around it 41 years later, the magnitude of what happened. If we woke up this morning and learned that 48 people had been burned to death last night, can you imagine how the country would feel? That is exactly what happened 41 years ago. It is a failure for all of us that this has not been resolved and the truth has not come out. What clings to this entire discussion is the sense that they did not get justice because of where they were from - working-class kids from working-class communities on the northside of Dublin. If that fire had happened anywhere else in Ireland, they would have known the truth by now. That is the sense the communities and the families have. It is hard to shake that off when you read about it and when you talk to the parents, families and relatives who have gone through it, as I have done, and the local people who are concerned about it. The overriding sense of injustice is that they were just not powerful enough to get the answers at the time. Even the finding of probable arson stinks of saying it is their own fault and they probably set fire to it themselves. It is probable arson. Again, that just speaks to total social injustice, if the Minister understands what I mean. I know that finding was overturned, but that is the overriding sense. Families have been told to stop campaigning and to give it up so we can all move on, but I do not believe anybody could ever move on from 48 people being burned to death. The communities and families cannot move on from that, nor should they. None of us should move on from that until we have absolute truth and understanding of what happened. The Minister has listened to the families, to their concerns, to their representatives and to their legal counsel and she has responded. That is to be commended and the Labour Party supports her on that. I ask that Deputies from the local area such as me, Deputy Mitchell and others be involved in this process and that we talk to each other as we go through it. We want to be helpful in this and to be consulted as much as is reasonable, because we want to be part of the solution as well. When it comes to other legislative measures that are required, I am sure a briefing for local Deputies would be beneficial because we are part of the solution here. To conclude on these two matters, the Ministers are to be commended. They have listened to the fall gaps in terms of what Ukrainian individuals and families are going through in Ireland and they have put forward legislative underpinnings for certain requirements they have. They have also listened about the Stardust and have made the changes that are required. All any of us can hope, and both of these issues come from a very different but very real sense of injustice, is that those fleeing war will find comfort and love here and find their time here to have been empowering, loving and caring and that if they get the chance to go home at some point, they will have fond reflections on their time here in Ireland, and for the families of the Stardust victims, that they can look at their State and their legislative bodies and say that in the end they did listen and we did work together to find the truth.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Acting Chairman's indulgence. The reason for my tardiness was because the Oireachtas football team was playing a game in Mountjoy Prison. It was an event we felt strongly about that included a representative from all political groupings here. We saw the power of education. By pure coincidence, there was a deputation at the Oireachtas committee today to speak about the power of education in the prison system. A total of 70% of prisoners are early school leavers. I remember reading an article a couple of years ago about the fact that in the US, they can predict the number of prison cells they will need in 15 years judging by the literacy rates of ten-year-olds. I raise my experience and that of colleagues across the House playing a football match in Mountjoy Prison today in the context of the issues of literacy and the most disadvantaged because they are connected to the issue of school costs. Far too many of our conversations in our school communities are not about education, children, child development, literacy or numeracy. They are about money. I feel like I have made this speech about 14 times. I am quite sure Deputy Ó Laoghaire, who I thank for putting forward this motion, is sick of hearing me making the same speech over and over again but it is true that we have replaced the conversation in schools about children and education with a constant conversation about money. I was that teacher; I was that principal. You interact with the parent body on the basis of the money your school does not have to run itself so you chase the book money. Your parents' association effectively acts like a fundraising body. There are so many conversations about money. Principals and teachers do not want to be dealing with the administration of money. They do not want to chase parents’ associations to raise money. It should be considered completely pathetic that a school has to fundraise for basic provisions. We know what will happen in X well-heeled community versus in Y not-so-well-heeled community when it comes to fundraising. Some will have the money, and some will not.  Schoolbooks in Northern Ireland are free. There is no reason schoolbooks should not be free in the Republic of Ireland. It would cost the Government €20 million at primary level and €20 million at secondary level. Voluntary contributions, as has been mentioned, are not voluntary. People feel as if they cannot fully engage in school life unless they come up with a voluntary contribution. How humiliating must it be for a parent who does not have the voluntary contribution to engage in school life when they feel that they are getting constant reminders about this voluntary contribution, which can be linked to the availability of a certain resource within the school, a locker, etc? Surely, we need to ban that and just provide the €45 million that the Catholic Primary School Management Association suggests will be needed to replace that voluntary contribution funding. Let us do it. That is €40 million plus €45 million, which gives a total of €85 million. Making the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available to all families and making universal payments will cost approximately €125 million. In totting up of those numbers, I have not even come halfway to the figure of €500 million, which the Government gave away in tax cuts last year. These are the arguments that we will make and that the Government will make over the next couple of months. The Government will talk to the country and to the squeezed middle about the tax burden. It will focus its attention on that €1 billion that it wants to throw away on tax cuts, rather than helping every citizen with their constitutional right to a free education.  The Department does not want a free books scheme because its officials wants to have an arm’s length relationship with the school system. They thinks that it is a matter for patron bodies and for boards of management to run schools and that it is not for the Department to get involved. That is their attitude. It feels to me that they have the Minister and Minister of State that it wants. They are driving the bus and the Minister and Minister of State are sitting on it. Whatever they say goes. There is no radical view to unburden parents of this money conversation and to let loose a conversation about children. Can you imagine, a Chathaoirleach, how liberated a parent would be if they were able to go to a school gate and not be worried about being asked about money? Could you imagine how liberating it would be for a parent to go to a parent-teacher meeting and not to be worried about money? Could you imagine how liberating it would be for a parent to not worry about the child coming home from school with a reminder about money? I have not even spoken about the children yet. Could you imagine how liberating it would be for a child to be in a class and not to be reminded in various different subtle ways about money, such as book money, voluntary contribution, the fundraiser that is coming up, etc?  While it is about the money, it is not just about the money; it is also about all those conversations that are being lost. This is about parents who may have had a difficult engagement with the education system. Maybe they were early school leavers or their experience in school was not the best and they would like to engage a little more. Sometimes fathers in education find it difficult to re-engage with the school. They find it daunting and intimidating. Would they be less or more likely to engage with school life or with a school community if it they thought that they were going to be asked about money? I would say that the answer is less.  The Government has flitted away €500 million on tax cuts for some people this year. It is determined to do cut twice that amount next year. Yet, it could lift the entire country and make people proud to be in an education system that provides books for free, does not ask for voluntary contributions and has the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for everybody and replaces that really humiliating, debilitating feeling that people cannot engage in school life because they keep being asked for money.  I will sum up what I am saying. I have said it many times and I know that the Minister has heard it many times. I appreciate the opportunity afforded to me by Deputy Ó Laoghaire and the Acting Chairman for sandwiching me into the debate this evening. Education is so precious. You only know how precious education is when you meet those who did not have the opportunity to fulfil their potential within it. I met loads of them today.  Some 70% of prisoners are early school leavers while 17.9% of the adult population is functionally illiterate. One third of children who leave a primary DEIS school have basic reading difficulties. We have problems and, therefore, the issues we need to discuss regarding schools are education, literacy, diet, oral language, family literacy, school community engagement, sport, health, parenting and so on. Yet, the tragedy of the education system is that we spend so much time talking about money. The parents’ association is effectively a fundraising body, as are we as politicians. Let us be honest here. We all get the requests to take out advertisements from the local primary school or secondary school when it is running a fundraiser. Is that not pathetic? Can we all recast our brains for a second? Is it not pathetic that a politician would be asked to take out an advertisement by a primary school, which has to run a fundraiser to keep the lights on? Is that not pathetic? Can we all step back from this for a second and ask why we are not just funding the schools so they can keep the lights on and not constantly have to chase people for money or voluntary contributions? Here are the maths. There must be €20 million for a primary school free book scheme, whereby nobody has to bother with a school book list anymore and the school just provides them. We would not have to worry about that anymore. There must be €20 million for second level. That amounts to €40 million. There must be €45 million to fund schools centrally and properly so they do not need to have voluntary contributions. There must be €125 million for a universal back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, notwithstanding the announcement that the Minister made earlier, which, I am quite sure, was on the foot of the motion had been tabled. That is how the Government reacts. It wants to have some way of counteracting Opposition motions because it does not do the governing itself. I have not even come up to half the amount that, as I said, the Government flitted away in tax cuts last year. Please do something for families who want to talk about education and not about money, take this issue seriously and deliver on the right to free education, which has been a myth since it was enshrined in the Constitution so many years ago.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is very difficult because schools sometimes feel completely unsupported in embracing issues, particularly when the actions of the Minister of State in the Department are part of the problem. That is what we are trying to achieve here. I absolutely stand over my comments. To be quite frank, only for the fact that we are focusing on children this week, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education would be facing calls for her resignation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:“(2) Where, following consultation with the Minister and having regard to any information provided to the Council by the Minister in relation to any planned additional provision of education for children with special educational needs and available lands and buildings, the Council remains of the opinion that there is insufficient capacity in an area for the provision of education to children with special educational needs, it shall prepare and submit a report on the matter to the Minister.”.I will give an overview of my amendments, and my colleagues will want to speak on theirs. First, in consultation with the Minister, which I appreciate, I am happy to accept the amendment to amendment No. 9. Amendment No. 3 inserts, "Where, following consultation with the Minister and having regard to any information provided to the Council [the NCSE] by the Minister in relation to any planned additional provision of education for children with special educational needs and available lands and buildings, the Council remains of the opinion that there is insufficient capacity in an area for the provision of education to children with special educational needs, it shall prepare and submit a report on the matter to the Minister." Amendment No. 4 relates to timing and states that, "such a notice shall issue no later than the 31st of March". The idea here is that it is unfair not to give a school enough time to open in September. Our contention is that later than 31 March would be too late. Amendment No. 6 states, "Prior to preparing a report under subsection (2), the Council shall consult with the Minister...". This relates to consultation, and it is important. In the briefing that was afforded to us by the Minister, and we very much appreciate that, this Bill is about truncating the process so we do not have an elongated process. However, it is still important that we have a list of those who we should consult. It is similar with amendment No. 9. The Minister has proposed an amendment to that amendment and we accept that. The other amendments are similar to that as well. I have given a broad sweep of what we are intending to do here. It is mainly about consultation and making sure the school is given the best opportunity to open in September. The timeline would be important there. We are accepting the amendment to amendment No. 9.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I moved the amendment for Deputy Ó Laoghaire.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not in any way our intention to prolong the process. The briefing that the Minister's Department provided is very clear. It is trying to truncate the process and is trying to take simultaneous steps along the way rather than sequential steps. What we are saying here is very much that schools can prepare if it is something that needs to be utilised. The Minister has said she does not want to be in a position to utilise it unnecessarily and it is not the best way to go. Schools have to prepare. If a school opens a special class for the first time, it changes the dynamic of the schools. It is a good and positive change. It is something that will benefit everybody, but schools have to be empowered to embrace that change. They need to know how to change properly and well. That is what our amendments are trying to achieve. We are in no way trying to exhaust the scenario or to make the Bill in front of us redundant because it effectively does what the previous Act would have done. I wish to make that case strongly. I appreciate where the Minister is coming from on the issue of the 31 March cut-off and emerging situations. I can appreciate that the Minister wants the leeway to engage with schools in the months of April and May. I am happy to withdraw the amendment. However, I wish to state that the point of the amendment is that we are not in a situation where schools have no time. I think the Minister will accept that it would be better, in the majority of cases, that such a decision or such an introduction be made well before the month of April. I can appreciate that the Minister would want the leeway within legislation to be able to act in an emerging situation. On that basis, I will withdraw amendment No. 4.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, line 5, after “person” to insert the following: «“, such a notice shall issue no later than the 31st of March preceding the new school year and shall not be issued during the months of July and August”.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Bill, which the Labour Party will be supporting. I thank the Tánaiste for his work in respect of it. As has been said, people often take trade unionism for granted or do not understand the nature of it and what it achieves. People's interaction with trade unionism, if they familiar with it, often involves their seeing images of picket lines, protests or placards. However, what trade unionism does all the time is work to improve the conditions of workers. It works with the Government, Departments and individual Ministers, it gets legislation over the line and it improves the lot of the workforce. That is why unions are so important. As has been said, that is why people need to be members of unions. It is not always about disputes, although disputes will happen in any walk of life. It is about spotting a problem, seeing a resolution, working with fair-minded people in government who are willing to work with trade unions in getting something over the line. In fairness to the Tánaiste, he has worked in a fair-minded way on this issue and has brought forward this legislation. That is to his credit. It is slightly depressing that legislation such as this is deemed necessary. You would have thought that if an industry dealt with its workers fairly, a tip allocated to a worker would remain in that worker’s possession. Unfortunately, however, we cannot have that level of trust with certain industries. That is why we need legislation in this regard. We have to reflect on the hospitality industry in Ireland. It is important that we restate this. The level of vulnerability of workers in this industry and the level of low pay, as has been outlined, are quite stark. Some 23% of Irish workers are on low pay by OECD standards. We have the third-highest proportion of low-paid workers in the OECD. That is something which shames us. A very high proportion of those workers are in the hospitality sector. They are disproportionately migrants and women. It is not just the cost-of-living crisis that should make us reflect on how difficult it is to be in low-paid employment. That is a constant struggle. Also there are vulnerabilities around the security of that employment, and, certainly, the number of the workers in question who are unionised can be lower than in other sectors. That is the very reason why legislation such as that before us is necessary. The Labour Party congratulates the One Galway movement, the One Cork movement and Senator Gavan who brought forward legislation on this matter in the Seanad. The hospitality industry always seems to be at the forefront of advocating for lower wages, for the breaking of sectoral pay agreements, for the disbandment of joint labour committees or whatever. The industry appears to be resistant to change and is unmoved by the reality of the workers who keep their businesses afloat being paid so poorly and being so poorly treated. The industry is held together by low-paid workers and by those who are particularly vulnerable. While we absolutely welcome the Bill, we need to have a wider discussion about stronger collective bargaining rights for workers. We need to have a scenario where not just that the workers have the right to join unions but where there is a requirement on employers to engage with those unions. It is no accident that the weakness of collective bargaining legislation in Ireland is a direct correlation to the numbers of people who are on low pay. If you are a member of a union and if you work in a unionised profession, the productivity and pay relating to that profession are better and everybody is enhanced by being involved in the relevant industry.However, when one has an industry which seems to be built on profit-making from the hard labour, insecurity and low pay of vulnerable sections of society working in that industry, then that has to be challenged. The Labour Party, and our spokesperson, Senator Marie Sherlock, welcome this legislation. It reflects well on the Government. It reflects well on the Department in which the Minister of State, Deputy English, works. We look forward to the next Stages of the Bill next week. The Minister of State will accept that we make this argument on this side of the House regularly. We have a problem with low pay in Ireland. We are a low-pay economy. We stand out as a matter of shame in Europe on the rates of low pay. It affects women disproportionately. It affects migrants disproportionately. It, obviously, has a knock-on effect in terms of accommodation and other levels of insecurity in life, such as mental health stresses. It is particularly profound in the hospitality industry. The industry has a great capacity to go on the airwaves and talk about poverty and how difficult it is. Many of the concerns are valid but if we were to challenge them properly, the rates of pay in the industry are partly the reason it cannot attract and keep staff. When it comes down to it, it will have to wise up and not stand over - we cannot stand over as a legislative body - the practises within that industry anymore. While we appreciate this Bill, this has to be one small brick in the wall of defence that the worker needs to have in advocating for himself or herself. We need to have a unionised workforce in the hospitality industry. Legislation from these Houses needs to protect that workforce so that it has proper engagement with employment, its payments can be enhanced and protected over a period of time, and security within that work can be enhanced and protected over a period of time, and that within their union, people have a department that will consistently work with them to improve their lot. I look forward to further debate next week.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party will oppose this motion. In recent weeks, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has driven a coach and horses through the long-established process for bringing legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. He rammed through the mica redress Bill, and every Stage of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 has brought complex and substantial amendments outside the original scope of that legislation.Later today, 72 Government amendments made in the Seanad to the Electoral Reform Bill will be dealt with in 45 minutes of debate before going to the President for signature. It is an appalling way to make law that will determine the future of our democracy. Now the Minister is introducing, at a very late stage, six sets of complex amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that run to 48 pages. The original Bill was only 18 pages long and dealt with some technical issues. He will triple the length of the Bill with his new proposals. One of the sets relates to short-term lettings. While potentially welcome, the Labour Party has warned for years of the need for stronger regulation of so-called Airbnbs. As far back as 2017, my former colleague, Mr. Kevin Humphreys, introduced a Bill to provide for a register of properties, with fines for those who do not comply. It is good to see the Government finally catching up now, five years later, but it should not be rushed through like this. There has been no scrutiny of the proposals at committee and no engagement with stakeholders or teasing out of how these new laws will work in practice. Many of the proposals being legislated for also relate to the Minister cleaning up mistakes previously made by proposals passed by this Government and its predecessor. Some of these are technical in nature and relate to ministerial directions and the OPR, flexibility in planning applications, maritime area planning and the Valuation Acts. What is not clear is why these could not have been progressed in the Seanad or introduced when the Bill was originally published. The most controversial set of amendments relates to judicial review. It was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under Fine Gael, and supported by Fianna Fáil, that created the crisis in An Bord Pleanála and the avalanche of judicial reviews when it introduced the strategic housing developments legislation, bypassing the normal two-stage planning process. We warned at the time that this would result in a significant increase in court activity, and that has been borne out. There was no compelling reason to bypass local authority planning, as it has done nothing to speed up the planning process, and An Bord Pleanála was clearly not equipped to deal with the massive increase in large and complex housing developments that require local planning expertise. However, now, without any pre-legislative scrutiny or Second Stage debate, the Government is planning to limit the ability of people to take judicial reviews and even when the courts find mistakes made by An Bord Pleanála, it will allow it to fix its own homework to pretend it never happened. Planning law solicitor, Mr. Fred Logue, has helped to highlight the problems with the Minister's approach. It effectively moves the goalposts for anyone who legally challenges a planning decision. He said in the Irish Examiner yesterday: "Under European law, the system has to be fair, equitable and not prohibitively expensive." I wonder where the St. Anne's campaign would be now if this legislation had been in place before the campaign began. With the sudden resignation of the deputy chairman of An Bord Pleanála at the weekend, it is crucial that the Minister now fast-tracks the publication of the report by senior counsel, Mr. Remy Farrell, in full. It is essential that people have full confidence in the planning process and if the report reveals more systematic and seismic issues in An Bord Pleanála, they must be addressed. Transparency and fairness are the bedrock of any democracy, and trust in the planning system is vital. The amendments being forced through raise serious questions about the crisis at the heart of our planning system. These changes raise serious questions of European law and constitutional concerns about the restriction of access to the courts. That is why we oppose the motion. If the Minister wants to understand why there are so many successful judicial reviews of planning decisions, it is because a dysfunctional Department and a willing Minister keep bringing forward last-minute legislation. The actions of the Minister also raise serious constitutional questions about the level of scrutiny afforded to our legislation. He has a proven track record now of bypassing the processes and Standing Orders of the House to get his plans put into law. Rushed law is bad law, and the Labour Party opposes this motion.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Rents in this country have reached record levels and the situation in Dublin is a crisis. Rents are more than 50% higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger in 2008. This is causing misery for my constituents in Dublin Bay North. We must conclude that the housing market has failed. We need much stronger State intervention to increase supply through the direct building of social and affordable housing. We need stronger controls on rent increases and we need to limit the causes of evictions. Even at this late stage of the rent crisis, the whole country still has not been designated a rent protection zone. It is not too late for the Government to take some action. Tax rates on speculators need to rise rapidly. The calls for rent relief for landlords already enjoying record rent levels must be firmly rejected. The State needs to take on those engaged in land hoarding and speculation. Use must be made of compulsory purchase orders, the windfalls on development land must be heavily taxed and the LDA must be transformed into the dominant provider of affordable housing. If we want to reduce rents in this country in the long term, there is one clear way to do that. The Government must build tens of thousands of State-owned cost-rental units and destroy the business model of those who expect to make rack-rent profits from the rents paid by ordinary workers. Since 2016, this House and the Seanad have debated a multitude of housing Bills and motions, many of them dealing with the issue of renters and the protections they need. The Labour Party in government froze rent increases for two years in 2015 but, since then, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have allowed record rises. In our Social and Affordable Housing Bill 2016, my party proposed to limit increases for new properties for lease to align with prices for comparable properties in a particular area. This would have stopped landlords evicting tenants or terminating leases in order to get a new renter in to pay the latest market rent. Fine Gael in government voted that Bill down in December 2016, with the abstention of Fianna Fail. As rents got higher and higher, we repeatedly called for a freeze on increases for a minimum of three years to allow supply to catch up. That was one of the key issues in the 2020 general election. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil refused to act. Landlords were allowed to set whatever rent they wanted for a new tenancy and to increase it by 4% a year for existing tenants. The refrain from the Government parties was that our proposal was unconstitutional, despite it having been implemented by the Labour Party in government for two years from 2014. Whenever the Constitution is invoked on property rights, we should always remind ourselves what it actually states. It recognises a right to private ownership but it goes on to state in Article 43.2°:1° The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.2° The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.The principles of the common good and social justice are set out in the Constitution in reference to private property. When people can barely afford to live, when Irish rents are out of kilter with those in the vast majority of similar European countries and when more than 10,000 people are homeless in the State, we can all agree that a case for protecting the common good could be strongly made. Our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021, which we introduced last September, would have massively restricted the grounds for eviction and frozen rent increases. The Minister made soothing noises at the time about working with us on it but nothing substantial happened. As a result of his failure to act, there is a plague of evictions now happening across the country as landlords seek either to sell properties at the top of the market or use any excuse to get their existing tenant out in order to put a new one in place. A commercial tenant has more rights if the shop he or she leases is sold than does a family when its home is sold by an investor. Why is this? It is because, for some reason, the Government believes the investor must be allowed to achieve the maximum price he or she can. Where is the common good in that, as laid down in our Constitution? We all know the result of this lack of action. More than 10,000 people, and rising, are homeless, including 5,054 single people, 3,028 children and 1,366 families. A modern tragedy is happening right in front of us. Simple changes to the laws covering evictions would shield a lot more people. If the Minister wanted to change the law today, he could do so. He has no compunction about rushing through changes on electoral reform and planning but God forbid he do something to stop a family being evicted or a child going into homelessness. Why not change the law to make it binding that any landlord who wants to sell a house with an existing tenant must first offer it to the State? We should put in place a default compulsory purchase order law for people's homes whereby the seller would get the market price, the family would get security and the State would save on having to deal with another homeless case.As I said during the debate on our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021 last September, it just makes us all wonder what is the priority of this Government. Whom in the housing market is it trying to protect? There is no equivalence between the danger the renter faces and the danger a landlord faces. We are constantly told that landlords are fleeing the market, but the number of households living in rented accommodation was more than 500,000 in 2020 and that figure has doubled over two decades. The State is subsidising the mortgages and profits of tens of thousands of landlords and investors through the HAP, rent supplement, RAS and other schemes because of decisions made by Fianna Fáil in the late 1990s to get out of the direct building of social housing. The consequence of that is that more than €1 billion of current spending now goes to vulture funds and private landlords instead of towards investment in assets that could provide multigenerational security. We can change that, but it will not happen through the continuous outsourcing of provision to developers that Fianna Fáil is once again engaged in. The State must build and it must challenge the for-profit driven housing model. We can change things, but it is clear that it will not happen under this Government or under this Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State and acknowledge that today is a historic day. It is a little bit of history. We did not have a statutory sick pay scheme and now we do. It was on foot of a Labour Party Private Member's Bill that this conversation started. The Minister took it on in good faith, we have come to the conclusion of that discussion and workers are in a better position today in Ireland than they were two years ago. While it is not perfect, we will work with it and try to improve it. I credit the Department, the Minister of State and the Tánaiste for working with us to get it to this point. Workers are in a better position today than they were two years ago, and that will always be a good day, particularly for people in the Labour Party. In particular, I thank and pay tribute to the efforts of Senator Sherlock in this regard.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have raised this issue on a number of occasions. I have been campaigning on this issue for a number of years, as have the local Labour Party and our local area representative Shane Folan. This impacts some on my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, as well, because the issue borders his constituency too. I am referencing the Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 area, where the Minister of State will be aware that there are thousands and thousands of new units being constructed. It is effectively a new town. Within that new town we need to not repeat the errors of the past when we only built dwellings and did not build the community infrastructure. Obviously, other things are needed rather than just a Garda station. We have been to the forefront of advocating for new schools. We had a successful campaign to have a new second-level Educate Together school. However, more is needed for families to grow up and for the place to feel secure. In that area there has been an identifiable need, which has been recognised by the Department of Justice and by senior Garda management for a new Garda station. The site has been identified at Northern Cross. In June 2019, the assistant Garda Commissioner gave notice that they were moving to progress to construction of a new Garda station at that location. It would serve the existing communities in Dublin 17, in Dublin 13 and the wider communities. If you move to a new area and things are beginning to knit themselves together, you need the sporting clubs, the community associations and you need to know that the agencies of the State are there to serve you, to work with you and to protect you. It has come to my notice in the more recent past that there has been a number of troubling instances in Fr. Collins Park. They have been of a physical assault nature and of a verbal assault nature. There has been a racial component to them. This has been bubbling under the surface for a number of years, unfortunately. That is not to suggest in any way and that that part of the world is any different to any other part of city. Every part of the city has policing concerns and antisocial behaviour concerns. We have had issues around Clongriffin DART station as well, which has been targeted by antisocial behaviour. When Shane Folan, other Labour Party members and I began this advocacy with the Clongriffin community association which had identified this need and made presentations, it was welcome that those who were in government at the time and Garda senior management were listening and identified the validity of the case being made. The political response has always been that this is a matter for Garda management. We felt that was a dispiriting response, when the Government at the time could see fit to reopen Garda stations that had been closed. I make reference to Stepaside Garda station. However, this is a good news story. The community has gotten involved. The community wants to look to the future. It wants to build an area that it can be proud of. It wants to focus on community infrastructure. The Government responded positively. The assistant Garda Commissioner responded positively. We are now in a position hopefully to move forward. What I want now, and I raise this issue as often as I possibly can, is to get an update on where we are on the construction of this Garda station at the site of the corner of Northern Cross on the Malahide Road to serve Dublin 13, Dublin 17 and the wider jurisdiction.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am reassured by the response from the Minister. I do sometimes get a little disappointed with the political reaction as if there is no influence that the Minister can have in this regard. We know that the soft power of a Minister can be quite strong. The Minister needs to be an advocate and a persuader for this. Her office and her Department needs to be fully engaged on the progress of this. While the Garda Commissioner has described it as exciting, the site has been identified and talks are ongoing between Dublin City Council and the OPW, the community is still waiting. There have been justifiable delays.Covid was obviously one reason for that. Yet, we are still seeing a lot of construction around that area. As a public representative, with other public representatives, I want to be able to stand over our period of influence in that area in 50 years' time and say that we put everything in place to ensure that the area was a thriving community, a place to be proud of, a place to bring up children and a place for families to feel safe and secure.  I do not like the arm's-length response that we often get from Departments, as if there is no influence that can be brought to bear. Having said that, the message that I want to see passed on to the Minister is that we would like her to be a persuader for this project and to actively engage on the issue. I ask that the Department do anything it can to make the process easier. I ask that the Minister is willing, able and at hand to be a facilitator in the process. I will continue to raise the issue. I am not going to let it go. I feel that we have to move to a position where a Garda station is constructed so that communities can feel that the community infrastructure is going in and that they live in a proper community with all the services and resources a Garda station will provide for them and the wider area. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to ask the Tánaiste about what is probably the biggest issue the Department will face over the coming months, which is rising energy prices and their impact on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and the potential knock-on impact on employment. What sort of analysis has the Department made on the potential impact on employment in the coming months? What supports will be put in place to prevent businesses going under and for unemployment to increase as a result of that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We need to see from the Tánaiste’s Department some kind of projections and worst-case scenario as to what sections of the economy are more at risk from higher energy prices and the knock-on effect of unemployment. I am sure that there are senior officials in his Department who can have some kind of an opinion as to what we are facing into in a worst-case scenario and what supports may be needed to be prepared for in such a scenario. Has the Tánaiste spoken to the energy regulator when it comes to energy prices right across the board, but particularly, in this instance, for small and medium-sized enterprises? Could the Department have a scheme that it may be able to roll out which could prevent job losses? It could have some kind of employment support scheme, as it had in the past. As the Tánaiste is aware, some businesses across Dublin, across the country and in my own constituency, did not survive the Covid-19 pandemic and some that did might not survive this crisis. I ask the Tánaiste again about the type of analysis that his Department may be doing as to worst-case scenarios.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that we have experience through the Covid-19 period as to what is necessary and we are going to have to do that at least but I hope the Department may be in a position to prepare for that worst-case scenario because it is going to need to have some plans in place that, hopefully, it will not have to revert to. If we have a situation where businesses go under and unemployment increasing, that is a winter that none of us really want to face into. As I have said, many of these businesses have been wounded during the Covid-19 period. Some of them came out of the financial crash ten years ago, Covid-19 has hurt them deeply and now they are facing into this. We do not want to see businesses struggling but, if they do survive, doing so on the basis of laying people off. While I understand that none of us can predict how long this is going to last or how deep it is going to be, we nonetheless need to give some comfort to businesses and to workers that they will not be left alone and stranded by any Government or potential Government scheme.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party has been saying for some time that Ireland needs a pay rise. What actions will the Tánaiste and his Department take to ensure workers across the board will get a pay rise? Not least of which the reason would be to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and energy bills they are facing in their households.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Herein lies the debate. What we have had for a very long time in Ireland is a disproportionate number of people on low pay. We also have a disproportionate number of people in insecure work. Perhaps the more we say this the more people will notice. A statistic I always tell the Tánaiste, and I know that he knows it, is that 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. He does not have to accept the recommendation of the Low Wage Commission. He could just decide to go immediately to a living wage of €12.90. It would have a knock-on effect throughout the economy. Many employers do not want to be accused of being a minimum wage employer. It would also increase wages all the while. There are also other issues. As the Minister knows, workers here are expected to pay for services for which other European countries do not expect their citizens to pay, such as GP care and childcare. Back to school costs are a classic example. We are in a bind as we have a disproportionate number of low-paid workers and families have disproportionate costs. On top of this will be an extra layer of expense during the winter. The pay rates of those on the lowest level are within the Minister's remit.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister mentioned again that he does not have to accept the recommendation. My point is that he could take it as the minimal rate by which he could increase it. He could increase it by more. He has to recognise the number of people on low pay and the costs they already have. We have had a cost-of-living issue in Ireland for as long as I can remember. There are various costs I have listed that people in Ireland are expected to pay that those in other countries do not. Those who come down from the North to live here are stunned by the fact they have to pay for school books and GP visits. These are very real things in the cost of living in Ireland. I have not mentioned housing or accommodation. I did mention childcare. The point on the minimum wage increase is that the Minister could take the recommendation as 80 cent at a minimum. He has already made a commitment to move to a living wage so let us do it. We recognise now that all of these elements in the Irish economy are building up on families who are not able to afford them. Those at the lowest level will need extra support from the Government. The living wage would be a realistic measure to take to address it and give comfort to those workers at the lowest level in our economy. Most of them are women and they are disproportionately migrants.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for facilitating this debate at this late hour. Last Wednesday, I attended a safety forum in Darndale. Safety forums across the northside are meetings that take place to discuss issues of concern in the local area, attended by local city council officials and gardaí. They are an effective way for local communities to raise their concerns with local representatives, city council officials, the Garda etc. The issue of this illegal commercial dump that has been in the general Darndale area for a number of years has come to a head. It has gone completely out of control. I visited the dump during the week with my colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, and was stunned by what I saw. There has always been a commercial dump, which has been an issue raised constantly with the city council, but now, possibly because of Covid but definitely in recent months, it is the number one issue in the area. It is out of control and dangerous. There are huge mounds of commercial waste and of earth. It is being overseen in an illegal fashion as a commercial entity. I visited it again today and rats were clearly visible running around this illegal commercial dump, which is in close proximity to people's homes. They are citing issues of ill health in the local community and are demanding that the council and other agencies of the State work to remove the dump and utilise the ground for more productive purposes. It could be used for housing, leisure facilities or commercial entities. There are any amount of possibilities for that spot of land, but currently it is a disgusting, unhealthy, illegal mound of commercial waste. My colleague, Councillor Gilliland, and other local councillors have called for a high-level task force to be set up. In other areas of my constituency such a task force has been successful. It has never been tasked with dealing with this size of a dump but that solution is being put forward as the way forward. On Monday, there will be a meeting of the local area committee on the north-central area of Dublin City Council. I believe the chief executive of the council has an interest in attending or, certainly, in being proactive about moving this material but it will need support from the Department and the Government because the council will not have the resources to do what needs to be done. Is the Department familiar with the problem? Is it liaising with Dublin City Council? If a task force is established and a way forward decided upon, will the Department be in a position to help the council to fund such a move for the benefit of the local community?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State and I am encouraged by what she said. It is true that this is fundamentally a responsibility for the local authority but what I get from her answer is that the Department is aware of the issue, that it is engaging with the local authority, DCC, and with An Garda Síochána on the issue. It comes to the stage now where it requires a multi-agency approach. It will require intervention and proactive action by An Garda Síochána to secure the site and it will require action by the local authority to clear the site and to ensure the future of the site is much more amenable. The Minister of State mentioned that in her response, so I am also encouraged by that level of vision within the answer. What the residents require, however, is to be told in good faith that their representations are going somewhere. What the Minister of State said is quite positive but they need to see action. They need to see moves by DCC to begin to move this material. It will need to see physical boundaries put around the compound and actions being taken. It will need to see a Garda presence and some kind of action plan on what the future vision is for this location. I would make the point that it has been said to me that this would not happen anywhere else and that this would not be allowed to happen anywhere else. There is a sense of a lack of faith in the agencies of the State and a lack of faith that they care enough. We do not want to go back to another one of these forums that is populated by public representatives, city council officials and gardaí to talk to the residents if nothing has been done within that time frame. While I appreciate the Minister of State's answer, I cannot but implore how important it is to the local community that it sees that the agencies of the State will work to remove something that is illegal, prosecute those who need to be prosecuted and allow this entire area to be used for the benefit of the local community, not for the destruction of that area so close to people's homes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join others in congratulating the Minister of State on his recent appointment. We look forward to working closely with him in the coming period. This Bill is about protection of the security or public order of the State. In a globalised world with complex technologies and equally complex supply chains it is clear that our day-to-day lives are acutely vulnerable to the malign actions of state or non-state actors which could seek to disrupt our lives for their own political, economic or simply criminal purposes. The true scale of our vulnerability was brought home by the hack of the HSE's data systems, which was an act of malice conducted by a group with evidence of informal links to Russian security services. The current energy crisis exposes the vulnerability of the EU for its overreliance on entities that believe their strategic interests are fundamentally different from ours. Unfortunately, the world is still haunted by the spectre of totalitarianism. The hostility to the EU from authoritarian regimes and their supporters both inside and outside the EU poses a significant long-term threat to our economic well-being. It is in this strategic context that it is clear we need to pay more attention to who owns or controls key components of our societal infrastructure. We must acknowledge we are an open trading country where FDI is and has been the cornerstone of our industrial policy and we are uniquely dependent on external companies for our economic well-being. There is no doubt that any mechanism to scrutinise external transactions has the potential to place a comparatively larger burden on our economy than on others in Europe. The purpose of the Bill is to put in place a legal mechanism to enable a Minister to review business deals and transactions to ensure they do not put the security or public order of the State at risk. It is being brought about as a direct result of the need for Ireland to implement Regulation (EU) 2019/452. In commentary on the Bill the Tánaiste has stated:This new law is to give us the power to intervene if a non-EU actor is seeking to make an investment which would threaten our security or public order. I think it's an important safeguard, which I hope we never have to use.I agree with him that this is an important safeguard. However, I am a little concerned that there may be some reluctance apparent on the Minister's part to use this legislation. I would be concerned if we ended up with a mechanism essentially rendered toothless by the political reluctance of Ministers to face down vested private interests. We should have no doubt that for every transaction sent for examination, there will undoubtedly be vested interests of business lobbying strongly for even the worst transaction to go through smoothly on the basis of their own economic interest. Therefore, it is just not good enough for a Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to have the power; he or she must be prepared to use it, even in the face of political pressure from many sources for a deal to go through. Ultimately though, this legislation alone will not be sufficient. It is increasingly clear to me and the Labour Party that one of the outcomes of the current energy crisis and the pandemic has been to restore the economic role of the democratic state as an actor in our economy, and this has vindicated many economists. The growth in public spending in Ireland is likely to result in a permanently higher level of public spending. We need a more prominent role for the State in the economy and this goes beyond just implementation of a single EU regulation. We need that more prominent role to protect ourselves from externally created security risks but we also need it in other areas. The cost and availability of housing, for example, are a chronic danger to our competitiveness but also fundamentally to almost all aspects of the functioning of our economic model. To address that high cost the existing developer-driven housing model needs to be radically disrupted. The Labour Party supports the aims of this Bill. However, the challenge for everyone is to balance on one hand the risks of having essentially inactive or useless legislation and, on the other, the potential damage to FDI if the process becomes a disincentive or a drag on ordinary transactions. Ultimately, we need a complete review of our industrial strategy. To build a more robust domestic economy we must overcome the challenge of growing an internationally-traded sector comprised of medium and large Irish companies as well as a strong State sector to protect our strategic assets, while all the time standing up to the external threats, private and public. We look forward to working with the Minister of State on the progress of this Bill.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Put in your CV while you are at it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have to reflect on the last contribution because it doubles down on a previous contribution concerning the Sinn Féin reaction to the budget. I am conscious of the Europe we are living in now. Looking at the UK, its economy is going down the tubes because the British people were asked to eat a flag in a Brexit referendum a few years ago. I see that in Italy a party with neo-fascist roots has been elected because people there have been asked to eat a flag. The same thing has happened in Hungary, Poland, Austria, France and the US. It seems to me that the No. 1 response from the main Opposition party has been to encourage Irish people to eat a flag as well and I find this utterly depressing. When I look at this budget, many parts of it are to be welcomed. It is not possible to look at some of the measures announced this week and not welcome many of them. I am thinking of the education system. For many years, I campaigned on the issue of schoolbooks and on changing the conversation in education from one of money to one of child development. I say that because, as I repeat often, the interaction between a parent and a school, and between school leaders and parents, can often be about money. That is a humiliating relationship if people do not have that money. Therefore, if we delete those conversations by inserting the State, which I think Fine Gael has finally concluded is a good thing, we will unleash the potential of that relationship to be built on something other than money. Therefore, the announcement of free schoolbooks at primary level is welcome. We should, however, always go further. We should do that at second level as well. We should ban voluntary contributions. We should talk about all those things in the education system that act as barriers to conversations between parents and school staff. Principals do not want to be fundraisers. The Minister of State knows that so many parents' associations become effective fundraisers.  On the capitation announcement, there really was not one. This is where the structural element versus once-off measures comes into clear focus. It was announced that €100 million will be allocated to address how schools will be able to get over the winter. This was not a structural announcement, though, and I wish to see more detail on it. I say this because, inevitably, when a school cannot meet its electricity or other energy bills, and one third of the cost of running a school stems from energy outlays, then that responsibility is going to fall back on the fundraising capacity of a school and parents will again be asked to put their hands in their pockets. Therefore, I want to see more movement in this regard as well. We are concerned that much of this budget, as my party leader, Deputy Bacik said, is a treadmill budget. It will see us over the next couple of months, but we could well be back here in the new year talking again about these structural issues that have not yet been addressed by this Government. It made an announcement concerning free GP care last year, but that has not yet been introduced for children of a certain age group. Announcements were also made regarding pandemic payments to certain healthcare workers and they have also not been delivered on yet either. Additionally, people in the Construction Defects Alliance are deeply concerned that the Government is suggesting the €80 million to be raised through the levy on concrete blocks will be enough to be able to fund the addressing of retrospective construction issues in future. Turning to housing, we absolutely could have a more visionary approach in respect of giving people certainty on rents by having a rent freeze and certainty on evictions by having a ban on them. Moving on to the area of SMEs, as the Labour Party's enterprise spokesperson, I would say we are very concerned about the Government's lack of preparedness for a jobs crisis over the winter. We could see many people on reduced hours or, indeed, losing their jobs because of the crisis small businesses are facing. While the Government has made announcements, I do not think they go far enough. I certainly do not think that supporting businesses is going to be enough; there must also be support for jobs. The Government did that during the Covid-19 crisis, and this is the basis on which it should approach this situation as well. There must be investment in programmes and schemes that will support businesses in trying to keep jobs, and this endeavour must be focused on the workers. I was struck by the last few words of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, when he spoke about families and businesses. It is not, however, just families and businesses that need to survive, but also the workers. It must be ensured that those workers still have jobs to go to in January, when, as I said, we could very well be back here in the new year talking about these issues again. Turning to the issue of childcare, the measures announced for that area are welcome because we had been talking about childcare for some years. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is to be congratulated because he has stuck with this and he has made the difference in this budget. Again, though, we believe that in the context of a cost of €275 million we could have a further intervention for families and a cap on fees of €200. I say this because we again stand apart in this regard as our childcare fees are the highest in Europe. We also pay for schoolbooks when people in other European countries, and in the North, do not. People here also pay for GP visits when nobody in the North or the UK does so.  My final comments will refer to my initial ones. I am proud to be here as a representative of the people of Dublin Bay North to interact with the Government regarding this budget. I have seen what has been happening across Europe, however, and I have also seen the main motivation of speakers from Sinn Féin, the main Opposition party, this week, and it worries me. I say this because for 100 years, or more, we have convinced people that if they could just eat a flag, it would make all of us much better. There must be a different way. The State must be bigger, it must be on people's side and it must support and empower them.People cannot eat a flag because it will not nourish them or make them happy. Our budget debate needs to be much more profound than that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will make a brief reference to the success of the Irish team last night in getting into the World Cup. That success was built on a level of trade unionism that stood with those women five years ago when they threatened strike action. That is what the trade union movement does. When it sees injustice in the workplace or anywhere else, it stands beside those affected and seeks to platform that injustice. It is on the shoulders of SIPTU that the Irish team is heading to the World Cup next year. That needs to be acknowledged. I acknowledge the other trade unions represented here this morning as we speak to our motion. The Minister has acknowledged our motion and thanked us for it. We get one motion every six weeks. That is how important the issue of section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers is to us as a party. I will speak a little bit about the drugs area. With regard to addiction and those working in addiction services, despite hiding behind a promised citizens' assembly on drugs, this Government has been the most absent and uninterested I have ever known when it comes to the drugs crisis. Something was said at the SIPTU briefing yesterday that I thought was very interesting. Section 39 workers do not want to be public servants because those people whom they work with do not trust the State.If someone is in addiction and powering their way through that scenario, if they find themselves down an alleyway injecting something into themselves or if they find themselves stained and soiled because of the disconnection in their life and the various troubles or difficulties they have had, the last person they are going to engage with is somebody from the State. We need these section 39 workers and agencies. What they are saying to us is that many of the projects they currently have are threatened. It is hard to get people to maintain their work within this sector. It is hard to attract people into the sector. In an environment where drug-taking and the manner of addiction changes all the time, it is hard to start new initiatives because they do not have the security. That security has to come from the Minister and, I would suggest, from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose absence this morning is a disappointment to us in the Labour Party. He is the person with control of the purse strings. It is often said to us that the Labour Party is trying to nationalise these services or wants all these workers to be public servants. That is not the case. However, we want them to be treated with the same terms and conditions as public servants, including those working with the HSE. It has been said that the HSE is sometimes like an oil tanker and those working in these section 39 organisations are much more nimble and can adapt to situations more quickly. The fundamental issue here is that these workers are not just changing lives; they are saving lives. It undermines the work they do when they are treated so unfairly and not treated with the same basic respect as other workers. How do you attract somebody into the service? How do you change the way of interacting with people who are so in need of a helping hand and of care and compassion? That is something they have never felt from the State because in their lives, the State has at every juncture treated them with a lack of respect. That can come from the school system, the courts system, the Garda or social workers. We all may find this hard to accept but it can come from politicians. That is the day-to-day reality these people are working with. Let us dispense with this myth that we are trying to fundamentally change the structure of these organisations. What we are trying to do is provide that helping hand that shows respect to people who find themselves in addiction and are trying to power their way through this heroic path to a new future. The person helping those people should also be dealt with with respect because respect goes so many different ways. Those are the main points the Labour Party is trying to make. There are question marks over this €100 million figure that keeps being bandied around the place. It was mentioned on Thursday by the Tánaiste and yesterday by the Taoiseach. It was mentioned by the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth during last night's debate on disability, which was brought forward by my colleagues in Sinn Féin, and it was again referenced by the Minister for Health today. That is a cost-of-living €100 million. That is a "keep the lights on" €100 million. It is not to be confused with what these workers are seeking. The Government needs to be an awful lot clearer as to what the proposals are for pay parity and basic respect for workers in these sectors. The Labour Party says to those section 39 workers, section 56 workers and section 10 workers that we value what they are doing. We only get time to propose motions once every six weeks. This is how important this issue is to us and we need it to be important to the Minister as well. We thank the trade union movement for its ongoing campaigns. If it was not for these workers, more lives would be lost and that would be on us.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sure the Minister will join me in congratulating the Irish women's football team on qualifying last night for next year's World Cup. Five years ago, many of these women had to threaten strike action in order to get basic respect within the FAI. I put it to the Minister that Irish soccer and Irish women's soccer, in particular, has not got enough support or respect from Irish politics. A woman in Ireland cannot be a professional footballer. Young girls who dream of becoming professional footballers have to go to England; many of them are doing that. Last year, the Government gave €95 million to the horse and greyhound fund. This is a direct fund paid for through a levy on betting. No other sport benefits from it. I suggest to the Minister, and I know the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Chambers, is quite committed to Irish football, that we find pathways for young women to keep playing in Ireland and should not say to them that they have to go abroad in order to fulfil their footballing ambitions. We should build on the legacy of what was achieved last night for future generations of Irish footballing women.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State and commend this legislation. My colleague, Senator Sherlock, who sits on the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, informed me that quite a number of recommendations that came from the committee were not adopted by Government when it came to this Bill. It makes us wonder why we have cross-party pre-legislative scrutiny. To be honest, committee rooms are where this Oireachtas works best. Often, when visitors come into the Gallery, they see the back-and-forth drama and theatre that goes on in the Chamber and hear the one-liners for clips on Facebook. All the real work happens in the committee rooms, where people generally try to work on a cross-party basis to improve legislation, which is the point of the exercise. Therefore, when a group of Deputies and Senators who are Oireachtas Members from different political parties collectively come together to make recommendations to Government on what they feel, having dispassionately, if you like, scrutinised legislation, one would hope that what they say would make its way into the Government's Bill considering that those who signed up to these recommendations include members of the Minister of State's party and other Government parties. I will shortly give a reminder of these recommendations. Some of the flags raised about this Bill came from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI. I remind the Minister of State that the MRCI is a highly responsible NGO that works with those who have been described as the most vulnerable workers in our economy. It has had endless successes in these Houses for promoting, amending or suggesting legislation. It works with Government in order to improve things and it has been endlessly successful because of the manner in which it carries out its business. Therefore, when the MRCI flags something, it is because it is genuinely concerned. We know in our political lives that when we get comments on legislation, we must make sure the representation is on the money. When a representation comes from the MRCI, however, we must take it seriously. As was said, migrant workers in this country are disproportionately exploited and poorly paid. They are disproportionately women and, as I said, on a lower pay scale. Therefore, when legislation like this comes across our desks to be debated in the Chamber and passed into law, we must keep them to the forefront our minds. The committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill states:The Committee recommends that workers with General Employment Permits are provided the same rights as those employed with Critical Skills Permits. A holder of a General Employment Permit should have the right to gain access to the labour market after two years instead of five, which would make it easier for them to challenge exploitation and substandard conditions.The Committee recommends that holders of General Employment Permits should be given improved rights in relation to family reunion and the access of family members to the labour market, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Justice should address this matter in conjunction with this Bill. It goes on to state that:The Committee has not seen sufficient evidence to support the proposed introduction of a Seasonal Employment Permit, [which is a key issue] and it is also concerned about the lack of detail in the proposal. The Committee recommends that instead of introducing the Seasonal Employment Permit, the scope and terms of the General Employment Permit be adapted to meet the need for seasonal employment. The protections and provisions under the existing General Employment Permit scheme must not be diminished, and workers’ rights must not be undermined.  What has been said, and what my colleague, Senator Sherlock, told me is that these recommendations of the committee are effectively being ignored in this Bill. The "bias" within this Bill, if we can use that word, is with the employer and to allow flexibility for the employer and not to protect the employee. The Minister of State graciously said with an open heart and with generosity, as he always does, that he will work with Members on Committee Stage.It is my experience, and others will agree with me, that it has been possible to work with the Minister of State on Committee Stage. However, it does not augur well when at this early stage of the passage of this Bill the recommendations put down by those who are tasked with doing pre-legislative scrutiny and trying to work best across parties to give the Minister of State advice on this have been ignored. It also does not augur well that agencies such as the MRCI are so worried about the balance of this Bill being about what is in the best interests of an employer and not in the best interests of protecting the most vulnerable of workers. I suggest to the Minister of State that we are working with him and that we will be seeking amendments to this Bill in order to redress that balance. In all these conversations we tend to have, the balance of conversation in these Chambers seems to be about what is most important for the employer. Whenever we have a conversation about sick pay it always comes down to what will be best for the employer and the same goes for wage structures etc. When it comes to the energy crisis we are facing into this winter and what companies, businesses and small enterprises will go through, that struggle for the employer to keep the lights on is always mentioned but not enough of this discussion is focused on the potential for employees to lose their jobs or be on reduced wages. We need to rebalance that. While taking the Minister of State's comments at face value and while we want to work with him on it, I ask him to reflect on the fact that those who in good faith made recommendations to him during pre-legislative scrutiny in the committee, from the Government benches and from the Opposition benches, particularly around the seasonal employment permit, were ignored or feel they were ignored. I ask him also to reflect on the fact that an agency such as the MRCI, which I have worked with closely and which I hold in huge regard, is also saying it is deeply concerned about what the Government is proposing. This is Second Stage of a Bill so anything can happen and we can make changes but the Labour Party asks that at this early stage in the passage of this Bill the Minister of State would reflect on the comments I have made.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am greatly encouraged by this debate. I thank Deputies Martin Kenny, Mitchell and Ward for bringing forward this legislation. All those Deputies have a great track record in this area. I am greatly taken by the remarks of Deputy Ó Murchú, who said the war on drugs is over. It needs to be over because the war on drugs is a war on people but it is also a war on a particular type of person. Deputy Paul Donnelly is absolutely right. We need to broaden this debate and talk about poverty, disadvantage and education. Deputy Gannon is also correct that we need to bring forward the conversation about decriminalisation of the drug user. My problem with this debate is that I have come to the sad conclusion, over a period of years dealing with this issue, that the State and the Irish public, including the Irish media and often Irish politicians, just do not value the lives that are lost enough. We just do not place the same value on the poor lives that are lost in the crossfire of drug crime or through addiction because they are perceived to be powerless. I often wonder if cattle died at the same rate as people do from overdoses in Ireland whether there would be a greater national outcry. If cattle died at the same rate people die of overdoses, there would be emergency legislation, national conversations, protests outside the door and media demands for action. However, because the people who die from overdoses or in the crossfire of drug crime are considered to be valueless or less worthy, it is allowed to continue. I will give an example from this week. Apart from the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs is probably the most absent and most disinterested of drugs Minister I have ever come across, one of the Government's own backbenchers this very week used a dehumanising term to describe people who are sucked into addiction. He called them "druggies". We have come a long way in Ireland. People who are vulnerable in Irish society used to be called dehumanising terms and we have moved away from that in so many areas. You used to be able to use in common conversation derogatory terms about the Travelling community, migrants, people with disabilities or people from the LGBT community. You cannot do that anymore because we have travelled so far but you can still use a derogatory term about someone who is sucked into addiction any day or night in the national Parliament or on the airwaves and get away with it. There will not be a cry from the Government parties or anybody else demanding an apology for using this phrase. The Deputy in question can go on national radio or his local radio station and double down on it because he knows society thinks the people he is describing are worthless. That, fundamentally, is what is at the heart of this. It is the inequality of it. The people who die, the young people who have guns put in their hands and get involved in drug crime do it because it gives them some perverse sense of empowerment and because they perceive they are locked out of mainstream society. This is the only way they can get respect. A child is given a gun and told to do a run. That is the only way they feel they can get respect. There are also, as Deputy Gannon quite rightly said, people who are so immersed in pain and trauma that they turn to addiction because it eases the pain. The people who are affected by addiction are disproportionately from disadvantaged communities, such as the Travelling community, migrant communities, people with disabilities, people from the LGBTQ community. That is because they are disconnected and addiction or substance misuse connects them to something. When we criminalise that use of drugs, we are actually criminalising that disconnection and that marginalisation. Yet a Government backbencher can walk in here, use that derogatory term and get away with it. He will get away with it. That Deputy is the chair of the education committee. We have an historic opportunity across these Houses to do something worthwhile here. Why can we not open the overdose prevention facility that was legislated for in 2017 and passed by Cabinet in 2015? It is waiting to be opened in Merchant's Quay. If it is not possible because of planning concerns, could we not have a mobile clinic? We could use our imagination and begin to save lives now. Are we not doing that because these lives are just not worthy? As the caller to the emergency services said when he found a dead body close to Merchant's Quay, "It is just another junkie". Is that the official State view? It is a view that exists in Irish society. We cannot challenge that view unless we collectively ask ourselves to do better. We could have had that injecting facility already opened or turned it into a mobile facility. We could have opened it in Cork or Limerick instead if there were planning difficulties. We have an opportunity in the citizens' assembly on drugs being held next year to change drug policy here for good, put the person who is most affected by this at the centre of the conversation, and, yes, decriminalise that person and lift that voice. We have to honestly ask ourselves whether the problem is that the lives that are caught in the crossfire, the people who are handed guns as children and the lives that are lost through overdose - we have the third highest overdose rate in Europe, by the way - are just not valued by us.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not agreed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Tomorrow, the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill is being debated, yet amendments have to be submitted by tomorrow morning before the Second Stage debate. We believe that contradicts Standing Order 182. On that basis, the Second Stage debate is a nonsense if amendments have to be submitted before the Second Stage debate. It is an extremely important Bill which the Labour Party wants to support, but it is problematic in parts. In order for it to pass successfully through the Oireachtas things have to be done right, but we are not doing that. I ask that the Office of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Office of the Ceann Comhairle assist us in doing legislation properly. Asking people to submit amendments before a Second Stage debate is not doing legislation properly.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the offices of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or Ceann Comhairle could assist in that regard, it would be greatly appreciated.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We welcome the legislation. We have been campaigning for it for many years. Previous Ministers for Justice said there was no need for it because of the 1989 Act which, as the Minister has just admitted, was ineffective. We welcome this debate and opportunity and we welcome the legislation, which we have to get right. I want to start on a positive note. I have just come from the Irish Traveller Movement Yellow Flag Awards in the Ark in Temple Bar. I saw all the children. If any of us wants to have any hope for the future, we should go to a school engaged in the yellow flag process and see what those children are achieving together and what we can learn from them. It was so inspirational and emotional to see children from all parts of the country coming together talking about their learnings and living in an Ireland which is so much more rich and exciting than the Ireland I grew up in. The Ireland I grew up in was stale, old and failed and everybody wanted to leave it. Now we have a country which is full of families who have come here to become Irish, to be Irish and to share this international experience. It is facilitated by the Irish Traveller Movement. I see Bernard Joyce is in the Gallery and he is so very welcome to witness this debate. It is striking, however, that the teachers of these children do not look like the children in their schools as much as they should. The first interface of a child with the State is probably in their primary school, maybe in junior infants. Far too many of our teachers are not as diverse as the children they teach. We need to challenge that and rectify it. There are reasons behind it. We do not need to flesh them out here. It has been said that hate comes from somewhere. Hate comes from ignorance and fear. It can come from poverty but not always. Some of the most closed-minded people I have ever come across are those who have most. Those who have most sometimes are most worried about losing what they have. They have this perception that equality is about taking from them the privilege they have and have always had. We need to challenge that as well. On the legislation, I have great misgivings as to how this is being done and how the Bill is being managed. We were asked as Members of the Oireachtas to submit our amendments yesterday, before the Second Stage debate which was due to happen yesterday and is happening today. That is not the way to do business. I raised it on the Order of Business yesterday. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform admitted that it was not best practice as did the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to express my disappointment and to make clear that if we are trying to amend legislation that we have to get right, because we have waited so long to get it right, we have to do it in the proper way. To demand of Deputies to submit amendments to a Bill before the Second Stage debate is not the best way to go about it. Leadership has been spoken of. I accept what other Deputies have said about political leadership, yet within these Houses we have had voices who have not helped. We cannot pretend that all of this hatred comes from anonymous online groups. We have to call it out for what it is wherever it happens. It happens in this Chamber. We have a Deputy of this House who has said that asylum seekers are freeloaders, hoodlums and blackguards. We have another Deputy who speaks in this Chamber and who has said that asylum seekers and immigrants need to be deprogrammed. We have members of the Minister's own party who have said that they will not deal with black Africans. We have had the most disgusting, violent, appalling things said about the Traveller community for as long as I have been involved in politics and people generally get away with such statements. They may have a small period of suspension from a political party but there is always a readmittance. That has to be called out and it has to stop. All of us in our own political entities, groupings and organisations have an absolute responsibility to call out hate and racism wherever it comes from. It is not good enough for us in the political system to stand up and make speeches about how much we agree with ourselves on how hate is terrible, but at the same time sit in committees and chambers with people who are well versed in using language to punch down on vulnerable communities when they know they can get away with it. One of the Minister's own colleagues, who just happens to be the Chair of the education committee, only two weeks ago described people in addiction as "druggies". He was speaking from about two rows behind the Minister. We all have a responsibility in how we manage the way we speak. We have an issue with hate. We have to understand hate, define it and work to eradicate it. We have to understand where it comes from. Criminalising it is one way of doing it but education is another aspect of what we have to speak about. If somebody is guilty of an offence under this Act, we have to meet what everybody wants to happen and what the victims of such a hate crime want to happen, namely that this individual will not reoffend and it will not happen again. We have to ensure that there will be a process by which this person can understand how their hatred has led to a situation of such destruction, unhappiness, anger and pain. We need to reflect on that. What we do not want is for somebody who is convicted of an offence under this legislation to double down on their hatred. There absolutely will be bad actors out there who will convince an individual who may be guilty of an offence that this is political correctness gone mad and that they have been criminalised for something that was in their head and that this is what happens when progressive politics goes too far. They will double down and potentially commit themselves to a lifelong venture of hatred. We need to be mindful of that. We have received submissions from academics, and particularly from the University of Limerick. I give great credit to Dr. Jennifer Schweppe and Dr. Amanda Haynes for the work they have done over more than ten years advocating in this space. When someone who has advocated for hate crime legislation for so long points out deficiencies in the Bill, we really have to take notice of what they are saying. We are anxious to get this legislation passed but we cannot rush it. If we get this wrong, if we make a mistake or if there is a false line in what we produce or pass, there are well-organised and well-financed groups that will pick holes in what we have passed and use that to politicise and radicalise young men in particular. The Ireland that I grew up in was made for people just like me. It was made for white, middle-class, able-bodied, heterosexual men. It was made for us. We have always run this place. We see ourselves everywhere. When I was growing up I saw people just like me in positions of power. The teacher, the garda and the person on television all spoke like me, all looked like me and all sounded like me. Such figures tended to be white, middle-class, able-bodied, settled, heterosexual males. If we walk around the halls of this esteemed building we generally see people who look just like me. If someone does not come from the background I come from and does not have that experience of seeing people just like themselves in positions of authority, they need the political system to work for them. It was interesting listening to the children this morning and to the presenter, Emer O'Neill. She is from an African background; her father is from Nigeria. She said she came to the conclusion when she was six that she just wanted to be different. She was dying to be different from what she was; she was dying to be the same as everybody else, because she was half African. That is such a heartbreaking thing to hear any child think. I am coming back to the point about the legislation and how we have to be so sure that if somebody falls foul of it, it is not something that is going to hang over them forever but offers potential for them to redeem themselves and think differently about themselves and their conduct. There is a difference. We have to concede that there is a difference in respect of a premeditated action of somebody who is hate-filled and decides to organise a hateful action of violence against a group or individual that they hate because of their identity. There is a difference between that and somebody in the course of a criminal action who is heard to utter something that is discriminatory. Those are two different things and if we treat them similarly we are making a grave mistake. We are possibly losing that second person for good by making them a hate criminal in so much as they are now equated with the individual who did something that was premeditated and organised. We need to reflect on that. That is why we feel so strongly about the amendments we have put down and why we are determined to work with the Minister and to ensure that this Bill, which has long been sought, is successful. Let us learn from the children. We had our chance. This is the country we have effectively shaped at this point in our lives but they come from a different Ireland to the one I came from. Their Ireland is so much more exciting, fresher, richer and has so much more talent. I am envious of the Ireland they and our children are growing up in versus the failed country and state I grew up in. I want them to grow up in a country that reflects them so that when they see people in power, people of influence and role models in their communities, they look just like them. We have to reflect on how many people of different backgrounds are in An Garda Síochána, politics, the teaching profession and other professions. How can we empower people to do that? We have to reflect on the comments that are made in chambers like this. It is quite rightly said that anti-Traveller sentiment is given free rein in too many political chambers. It is the last bastion of hatred which is almost given social acceptance. That has to be challenged and we have to do it in chambers such as this. Those who will punch down need to be challenged in political chambers. As we move forward it is not good enough for us to produce legislation in which, while doing the right thing, we make a mistake in labelling somebody for saying something stupid in the course of a criminal action, versus a person who has, over a period of time, demonstrated their hatred and organisation around that hatred. We have to be mindful of that and restorative justice has been mentioned. With all those things in mind, this is what a republic does. This is not about limiting free speech or thought policing. This is about ensuring that every child who grows up in this country can feel at ease and be themselves. Being themselves should be enough and no child at the age of six should ever have the heartbreaking thought cross their mind when they look in the mirror and wish that they were not what they were. We have to ensure that every child we have can grow in a country in which they are respected and that if there comes a point where an organised hate group or an individual decides to undermine them, the law is there to protect them and root that out. We have our responsibilities as well and Members of this Oireachtas need to know and be put on notice that we will be calling them out.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We had a pandemic over the last three years and it was science that helped us find our way through it. We are facing a climate disaster and it will hopefully be science that helps us through that. We have to facilitate the scientists of the future through our education system. We need to empower the teachers in the teaching profession and the colleges of education to ensure they are equipped to bring the joy and love of science into the classroom. There is a gender element to this, as the Minister will appreciate. Because our education system is more gender-segregated than any other in Europe, traditionally all-girls' schools have struggled in this area. There are suggestions that girls have not been afforded the same opportunity to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and science-based subjects as boys would have been. In the forthcoming citizens' assembly on education, there is an opportunity for us to flesh out what we are discussing here this afternoon. Certainly we have a disproportionately segregated education system, which I am constantly going on about. Some 17% of our primary school children attend gender-exclusive schooling and it is one third of our second-level schools. That leads to gender stereotypes and lends itself to restricted subject choice. Coming out of the time of Covid, we should have a much more expansive model of education. If a subject is not available because of limits in teaching staff or qualifications, there is no reason we cannot have remote learning from a centralised source so every student in every school in the country can study whatever subject he or she wishes. We have to be able to empower all students in all schools to study science. I am particularly conscious of that gendered element. It has been spoken of before. Unless we proactively deal with it, we are going to have these problems into the future. I suggest to the Minister that we can include this topic in the wider conversation of the citizens' assembly on education. It is important. I also echo the points my colleague, Deputy Sherlock has made about the Minister's trip to Cork in the coming weeks.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his presentation. One of the very few legacies of Covid that could perhaps be regarded as positive is the vast improvement in the availability of outdoor dining and socialising, provided for by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which this motion seeks to extend. The effect of the Act was that pubs and restaurants were specifically allowed access to and use of outdoor spaces for eating and drinking. This was done by emergency legislation, effectively sidelining by-laws and local authorities to allow us all to try to get some semblance of normality without being forced indoors and the resulting exposure in confined spaces to Covid-19.There is no doubt that this disease was having a real, devastating and unpredictable impact on people’s health prior to the arrival of the vaccines. Our condolences still go out to those who lost friends and family to Covid. The intention behind this motion is to extend the provision in the Act. The terms of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 are clear and explicit; that it is supposed to be a temporary measure. The Title to the Act states that its purpose is to:A. make provision, on a temporary basis, for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in certain circumstances in seating areas located outside licensed premises in order to allow, in the public interest and having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of the disease known as Covid-19, the businesses of licensees of such premises to operate in a manner that mitigates the spread of that disease ...The question is not whether we agree with the changes but whether there is still a sufficient risk from the pandemic to justify bypassing local by-laws and the democratic control of local councils and continuing with this emergency legislation in place. We have to be careful that we do not just end up using the Act as a permanent solution. However, there is still sufficient justification for us to extend the provisions of Act for six months as outlined in the motion. According to the Government's Covid-19 data hub, there were 32 deaths from Covid-19 reported last week, there was a test positivity rate of 12%, there were 316 confirmed cases in hospitals and there were 11 confirmed cases in ICUs. There is no doubt that the effects of vaccination have provided a significant protection for many. While many of us have moved on and are living lives that have mostly returned to normal, there is still sufficient prevalence of Covid-19 to justify the extension of these measures for now. We cannot take this for granted on a permanent basis, however. While in the majority of cases there has been little controversy regarding the implementation of the Act, if we want to extend it on a more permanent basis, this should be done on a firmer statutory basis, while retaining the role of the local councillors and councils to make local adjustments. It would make more sense to extend it until the end of next August, rather than the end of May, given that the summer months are when spaces get the highest use and are of most benefit to everyone. However, the base legislation only allows for an extension of six months. By the time this extension is finished, I would hope the Government would present a mechanism whereby the changes put in place would have the chance to be approved for extension by local councils and councillors across the country who should be deciding matters in any event. I would suggest that, as I have done in my remarks, one of the advantages of the Covid-19 readjustments to socialising was the experiment of utilising previously unused space on public pathways and so on. We have to move to a situation where, in our capital city and in towns across the country, the car being excluded from that space is continued. We need to reclaim that public space for public dining and socialising in order that families with young children and elderly relatives do not have to constantly worry about cars, vehicles and speeding traffic. Far too many of our towns and cities are choked with vehicles, and traffic management takes precedence over socialising and over that most basic need for human connection. If we can get any good out of the devastating pandemic of recent years it is that we can reimagine our civic spaces and public realm and extend these powers to the local authorities to reimagine how we interact with each other on a more permanent basis. The Labour Party supports the motion. However, in the future, we can hopefully have a more imaginative way of doing this through the local council mechanism.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her presentation, for her presence and for her interest in this issue. I am from Dublin. I love the city, I believe in it and I want to see a vision for it. Dublin city houses people from all over the world and, indeed, people from all over this country. On that note, may I state my disgust at any Member of this House suggesting that this country or any part of this country is being overrun by anybody. I think that if a Member of this Oireachtas comes in and makes statements like that, we have to challenge them at all times. Dublin city is a much more vibrant, colourful, exciting and culturally rich city than the city I grew up in and we need to stand by that and defend that. We need to have a 20-year vision for what we want Dublin city to look like. When I mention Dublin city, I am talking about the city between the canals. It is about what kind of transport we expect to have and what we want the city to feel like. I think we have to de-car the city; we have to pedestrianise the city radically. I have a four-year-old daughter and, I have to be honest, when I go into Dublin city with my daughter, I am constantly on watch for her safety because of the nature of how we have given over the city to the private car. If people go in with their elderly relatives, they feel the same thing. Why do we not have a radical approach to O'Connell Street and pedestrianise it? Why do we not turn O'Connell Street into the big civic plaza that this city needs? I know Dublin Bus will have strong opinions about that, and we can talk about that and maybe we can only pedestrianise one side of it, but we certainly need to reclaim parts of the city that have been given over to cars and to recast our brains as to how we can enjoy the city more. With regard to Culture Night in Dublin city, we should have a feeling like that at least every weekend. It should feel like a vibrant, culturally rich place where people want to be and want to be around, walk around, bump into each other and communicate with each other and have those human interactions. We should not just have that feeling once a year. It should be a weekly thing. The Minister mentioned football. I am fascinated by her comments about what is happening in terms of integrating young people and empowering young people. If we go to any city in Europe as a football fan, as I tend to do, we see that football tends to be one of the ways that a city expresses itself. When we come to Dublin city, the football grounds are falling down. There are conversations around Tolka Park, conversations around Dalymount Park, conversations around Richmond Park, all in the city centre area, all League of Ireland premier league grounds. There should be investment in and understanding of that type of city that believes in that football culture, not just once-off glamorous announcements about Euro 2028 coming to town, which is fine. However, that always replaces the potential we could have for big European clubs to come here all the time if our league was invested in better, because of a better experience of going to a League of Ireland ground, because of a professional women's league, because we have players here who are going to the World Cup and who are playing in that league. This is the sort of basic thing that every other city in Europe takes for granted. The Minister talked about policing. We cannot police our way out of this. We have to address, as has been suggested, the underlying issues of housing, poverty, disadvantage and drugs. I see the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is present. It is a scandal that the injecting centre has not been up and running since it was passed by these Houses in 2017. It is an incredible failure of the imagination of this Government to make it happen. I say that directly to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, because there could have been an imaginative approach to how we can stop people dying in alleyways in our city centre. Other European countries and cities across Canada and Australia have made these interventions because they believe in their city and they understand their city. Yet, even though legislation has been passed for the last five years, we waited for a High Court case and we did not have a contingency plan. We could have a mobile clinic or we could have a mobile intervention - we could have done something – but, no, we have just left the situation to persist and people are still dying in the alleyways of our city centre. We are letting it happen because, fundamentally, they are not important enough and if they do not overdose fatally, they leave a lot of the drug litter behind them and there could be excrement involved - it is a pretty unsightly experience for everybody. These interventions are important. It sometimes seems as if the Government is waiting for something else to happen or for somebody else to make it happen. There are some practical suggestions. We need a task force of sorts to look at five, ten, 15 or 20 years hence. We need to talk radically about pedestrianisation and we need to talk radically about the need to de-car the city. People will complain about that but we have to do it. We need to talk radically about making public transport free, so people can hop on a free bus in Dublin, hop on a free train in Dublin, hop on the Luas in Dublin for free, for all of those opportunities that people want to have of coming into the city centre and enjoying a cultural experience and it being free because we have invested in Dublin city in that way. On policing, we absolutely need a sense of security in our city centre but it is as if it is the go-to political response that we always say "more gardaí". Yes, we will always need more gardaí and there will never be enough gardaí, but we have to make the city policeable. If we have that volume of people who are in the city enjoying themselves and believing in the city, crime goes down not because there are gardaí everywhere, but because people feel prouder of it, they feel part of it, they feel connected to it and they feel respected by it. I taught in a part of the north inner-city and the kids would say they did not feel respected when they walked outside their own area, and if they walked into a shop they would get followed because of how they speak, how they dress or the address they are from. We need to respect this city and the people from the city. People talk about resources. I would make this bald point, and I direct this at the Minister’s party colleagues who sit on Dublin City Council and, indeed, many party groups on Dublin City Council who consistently, every year, cut the funding through the local property tax, some €12 million, that could be available to do all of the things that people in this Chamber are now complaining about. Every year, consistently, some groups in the city council, including the Minister’s group, cut the funding to Dublin City Council. We cannot complain about lack of resources, lack of bins, lack of infrastructure, lack of Dublin City Council resources, if consistently, every single year, political parties in the chamber of Dublin City Council, having the opportunity to stand up for the city, do the populist thing and cut the property tax by 15%. In saying all of that, I feel that, as others have said, the potential for a directly elected mayor of the city would give the civic leadership that has been lacking. I know there has been a citizens’ assembly on that and we want to see movement on it, and the Labour Party is supportive of that role. If we had that civic leadership, we would have buy-in to a long-term vision for the city. Let us be honest, the mayor is somebody who is in for a year and out after a year and does not really have an awful lot of power as all of the power is with the city manager or the CEO of the city council. There is a democratic deficit and the mayor's role has been reduced to being somebody who maybe gives moral authority to a cause or gives a level of civic leadership, but does not have the five-year term of office with the powers that are necessary in order to drive real change or accountability. For example, when the issue comes up about O’Connell Street, who is the obvious political leader to go to? Who is the obvious person who is going to feel responsible for this? Is it the Minister for Justice, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications or somebody else? There could even potentially be justification for a junior Minister for Dublin. We have junior Ministers for everything else so that could be something the Government could consider as well and it could work on a national level with the local city council.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I love Dublin. It is where I am from and it is where my child is from. One does not have to have a heritage in the city to be a Dub, however. A person or his or her family can be from anywhere in the world but have the added advantage of being a Dub as well. We need to think strategically and have a vision for what we want the city to be like in 20 years. Let us decarbonise the place, put civic engagement and community at the heart of it, fund it properly and give it civic leadership. When it comes to basic infrastructure, I mentioned football because I have an interest in it. That suggestion is something the Minister should take seriously. Every other city in Europe has it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ar son Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre, déanaim comhbhrón ó chroí le muintir an iar-Theachta Hillery. My sympathies and those of my Labour Party colleagues are with the family of former TD and Senator Brian Hillery, who died in January 2021.From conversations with a Fianna Fáil Member of this House, I know that the news of his death brought much sadness to all those who knew him during his long years of public service. Professor Hillery began his political career in the Seanad. He served there for many years until he contested and won a seat in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. It is clear that those who served with Professor Hillery in the Oireachtas remember him as a courteous and intelligent man. I understand that Eamon Gilmore, former Deputy and Labour Party leader, was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Dún Laoghaire constituency for the first time on the same day as Professor Hillery in the 1989 general election. In his words of commemoration, he described the late Professor Hillery as a gentleman. Accounts I have heard from those who knew him personally demonstrate this was an accurate descriptor. As well as serving as a Senator and Deputy, Professor Hillery was successful in several other fields. As an academic, he was the first professor of industrial relations at UCD. He also served as Ireland's representative on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, as a director of the Central Bank of Ireland and as a financial regulator. It was a career filled with accomplishments. He will be missed very much by family, friends and former colleagues alike. I note that his death occurred during a challenging time for the State, as grieving families were asked to continue to comply with Covid-19 restrictions and to cope with their bereavement in a very different way. Following the opening of society last year, I hope that members of Professor Hillery's family have been able to mark his impressive life in a way that helps them to heal. I further hope that the many testimonies to his kind personal qualities and his career achievements will have been of comfort to them. I send the Labour Party's condolences to Professor Hillery's wife, Miriam, and his children, Cliona, Conor, Eugene, Brian and Gavin, and his wider family. To his grandchildren who are here listening to these statements, I hope they will never forget this day when they were in Leinster House and Dáil Éireann listening to Members of the Oireachtas speaking so kindly and warmly about their grandfather. He served this country to the best of his abilities and that is a great testament to him and to his family.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that the issue of the accusations of abuse in Blackrock College has to be dealt with sensitively. I believe that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government are dealing with it with the greatest of sensitivity. There is an acknowledgement that an investigation or inquiry is needed. What is the Minister's view on the necessity of such an inquiry? What type of form would such an inquiry take, seeing as the Department of Education would be to the forefront of any inquiry into what happened at Blackrock College and other religious-run schools?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister's response but, in tabling this question, I had assumed there would be a good chance that by the time we spoke today an inquiry would have been announced. I understand that she is to make contact with Opposition spokespeople as to how best this inquiry could be formulated. I also understand that it is the Government's intention to have an inquiry. I am happy that the Minister is committed to having a survivor-led inquiry. It is important that the Government takes advice on any ongoing Garda investigations. The Minister spoke about how things have changed since the period in which some of these abuses took place, yet it is clear that some of those who were overseeing these institutions at that time are still in place. There are accusations that people who were involved in abuse still reside in these institutions. There are also accusations that people in positions of authority were approached 20 years ago and were told to return only if they had a solicitor. While the regulations and legislation and the oversight by the Department may have changed in the interim, the personnel who oversaw this and had responsibility for the care of children are still in place. What we need, at least from today, and I acknowledge that there will be statements on this later, is clarity on when and how this inquiry will be established and when it will take place.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I reiterate that I believe the Government is dealing with this in a proper manner.The Minister is dealing with it with the sensitivity it demands. However, weeks have passed and there needs to be a sense of when this inquiry will take place and what its nature will be. We must also ensure that none of this can ever happen again. While the Minister rightly points to changes in the system over the past number of years and decades, this needs to feed into the citizen' assembly on education to ensure that this deference to religious institutions and fee-paying schools in the system can be broken and that every child in every school is protected by the State. I look forward to the Minister's engagement and, hopefully, if not by the end of today, we will have clarity on how and when this inquiry will take place by the end of the week.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State will know that in October a lot of disquiet was expressed by school communities about the potential change in the AON process. I understand from her negotiations with the INTO that a pause was put on that process. I want to get a sense of where the process now stands.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The reaction I and other Deputies involved in this sphere got was very negative regarding the new responsibility schools felt they had to oversee, the workload being imposed on them and the lack of expertise teachers and principals have in terms of overseeing the process, especially when trying to account for a child's disability, including motor skills. On that basis, the issue has been raised in the House. Various education partners raised concerns with the Minister of State and Minister. In fairness, a conversation took place and I understand from the INTO statement the process was paused. Given that the process has been paused, what status does the pause now have? Will the idea be abandoned, changed in some way or reverted to?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State was coming to the second point I raised. It is not just about the workload, but also the expertise. Every Deputy in the Chamber will appreciate that principals, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and everyone else who works in a school community are heroes. They are often undervalued, the first to be criticised and face a great deal of negativity, but what they do for children of all backgrounds every day of the week is inspirational. If one ever wants to be uplifted in one's political work, then take a trip to the local school to get cheered up. Regarding expertise, teachers and principals have told me that properly assessing the needs of a child is the role of an educational psychologist. A teacher or principal does not have the expertise, or should not be expected to have the expertise, to assess the motor skills of a child. The Minister of State was about to address this point.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next week, the Labour Party will bring forward a Private Members' motion on the issue of drugs and the decriminalisation of the drug user. The Government has promised a citizens' assembly on drugs for early next year. Is the Tánaiste in a position to clarify when the proposed citizens' assembly on drugs will take place? It is needed. In many communities, the drugs crisis is spiralling out of control.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister for Education was in touch with my office to state she has other commitments this evening. Therefore, I appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State. I am interested in hearing what he has to say on behalf of the Government. The Minister of State will appreciate that when Deputies get 20 or 30 emails on a particular issue, they know something has gone drastically wrong.A review of the schools in Raheny parish is taking place. When I made contact with the office of the archbishop, the representative informed me this is one of a number of reviews. I understand 29 schools in 11 parishes, of which Raheny is one, are under review. I was told there is an independent facilitator whose role is to consult, listen and be part of the information flow. This is a process done in tandem with the patron body and Department of Education. Given that I used to be in that position as a school principal, as a rule I do not get involved in individual school issues regarding the future. It is an issue for an individual school and its patron body. These matters do not need to be politicised unnecessarily. However, this has a political component to it because the Department of Education is involved. The process is being so mishandled that, regardless of one's view on the future of primary schools in Raheny, everybody would feel as if they are not being heard, the independent facilitator is not doing the job properly and there has to be a restart. Anybody who knows anything about my politics will know that I believe in divestment and that having a disproportionate number of schools under one particular patron is not healthy. Anybody who knows anything about my political view would know that I do not believe single gender schools, in particular at primary level, can stand up to scrutiny. In Raheny there are two single gender schools and a mixed infant school and, I understand, after a period of consultation there is a proposal that one school would divest and the two remaining schools under Catholic patronage may be reconfigured along co-educational lines. Speaking to the representative of the archbishop, I asked him plainly whether there is an absolute guarantee that anyone who wants to have his or her child educated through the Catholic ethos in Raheny will have capacity for that to continue into the future. He said, categorically, "Yes". He said that to me, but that is not the understanding or knowledge of many people who have contacted me. I ask that the Minister of Education take control of the situation because clearly if people are forced to contact a local representative, they feel they are not being heard. We also need to hear the views of those who do not have children currently attending schools in Raheny but who live in the area. They may have a one, two or three-year-old child and would like to know if they could have some say as to what the reconfiguration of schools would be. To put it bluntly, this situation has got out of control. It is not working for anybody, including staff or parents. I ask the Minister for Education to intervene and ensure that the independent facilitator of the process does his job effectively because currently there is a lot of concern and insecurity about the future of schools and people feel as if they are not being listened to.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are two issues. One is that the independent facilitator has indicated that he will "read the room". No matter what side of the debate one is on, whether one wants divestment, co-educational schools or for things to remain exactly as they are, an independent facilitator saying to a group of parents or anybody that it will be his determination what the temperature is by just reading the room is not particularly scientific and does not give anybody any sense that this will be done in a fair manner. Second, I contend that the parents of a two-year-old have more skin in the game than the parents of somebody in sixth class. Yet, the parents of a child in sixth class, who is leaving a school next year, have more of a say in what the future of the school will be than somebody whose child is aged two, three or four, lives close to the school and intends to send their child to that school. The views of such parents are not being canvassed, yet they live in the area and surely have a view. This is why I am asking the Minister to intervene and communicate with the independent facilitator. We cannot ask people to have faith in a process when a determination will be made by facilitator who is going to read the temperature of a room. What if my child is aged two, three or four, I live in Raheny and have an interest in what happens to the future of these schools? Surely we should find a mechanism in the school catchment area to canvass the views of those who live locally and whose children will soon be of school-going age . As I said, those parents have more of a stake in this process than somebody whose child is in sixth class and is leaving the school and has no other children going through the school.Those are two reasonable points and the Minister of State needs to hear them and communicate them back. Otherwise, we are going to have a divisive process – indeed, we already have one – that will satisfy no one. Schools are magical places. We need to ensure they remain so and not have division.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That Dáil Éireann:notes that:— during the past 25 years of a law-enforcement approach to drug abuse, drug-related deaths have increased by 225 per cent, compared to a 68 per cent reduction in road deaths in the same period, with the total number of such deaths well exceeding 10,500;— Ireland now has the joint-highest rate of drug-induced deaths among 16 to 64-year-olds in the European Union (EU);— the number of people prosecuted for possession for personal use has increased over that period by 484 per cent, with more than a quarter of a million convictions recorded for that offence;— in the same period there has been a substantial overall increase in drug use, with use of cocaine rising by 10,376 per cent, benzodiazepines by 1,824 per cent and cannabis by 263 per cent;— drug abuse and its harmful effects, including crimes of violence, intimidation and extortion aimed at addicts, their families and their communities, are no longer urban phenomena and are spread across the State;— despite enabling legislation being passed in 2017, followed by Health Service Executive (HSE) procurement and the selection of a preferred operator to run the State's first medically supervised injecting facility in Dublin City Centre, this urgent initiative is still stalled;— although in 2019 the Government announced a health diversion programme, involving mandatory referrals to the HSE, the programme applies only to adults caught in possession for the first time, and progress on the implementation of this very limited initiative is acknowledged as "slow" in the mid-term review of the National Drugs Strategy;— there is no firm commitment to further progress on drugs treatment courts, to assist offenders with drug-related problems; — despite the significant number of people who abuse drugs and suffer from a mental health illness, our mental health services and addiction treatment centres are still not organised to holistically treat people with a dual diagnosis; and— the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future committed the parties in Government to convening a citizens' assembly on drugs but, despite the Taoiseach's stated intention to do so in "the latter part of this year", there is so far no indication as to whether or when it will be held;agrees that:— overall, there has been a lack of visibility at Minister or Minister of State level, a lack of joined up thinking between Ministers, Departments and State agencies, and a lack of focus, energy and urgency in spearheading the State's response to drugs;— the policy of criminalisation of the user has failed, nationally and internationally, the resources of the State are wasted on inappropriately processing medical addiction cases through the courts and prisons, and a health-led and patient-focussed alternative is needed;— the previous international consensus in the West on a law-enforcement approach to drugs is now collapsing, and over 30 countries have decriminalised drug possession for personal use in some form;— the worst harms of a criminalisation policy are experienced by people and communities who are already disadvantaged and marginalised, and a reformed approach must operate in the context of strategies to combat poverty and marginalisation;— a community-based health-led alternative response would target the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use and would provide harm reduction services to address disease transmission and overdoses; and— the 2001 Portuguese initiative of decriminalising possession of drugs and introducing a health diversion scheme, with a resulting significant decline in drug deaths in Portugal while they continue to rise across the EU, merits particular study; andcalls for:— a firm date to be fixed for convening the citizens' assembly on drugs, with the assembly requested by its terms of reference to:— make central to its deliberations the lived experience of individuals, families and communities who have directly experienced the impact of drug abuse, so that harm reduction and recovery strategies are developed in collaboration with those most directly affected;— ensure that, while it may legitimately join with other EU countries in considering whether to legalise possession of cannabis for personal use, this question does not distract from the separate and urgent debate about changes in policy and approach needed in order effectively to promote the rehabilitation and recovery of persons addicted to harmful drugs; and— specifically consider a policy that continues to tackle organised crime gangs involved in drug trafficking and dealing, but offers a non-criminal and comprehensive public health treatment, rehabilitation and recovery alternative for persons in possession of drugs for personal use;— emergency amending legislation to facilitate mobile supervised injection facilities, for both urban and regional sites;— regulatory oversight of all addiction treatment services, with a commitment to client centred and evidence-based recovery programmes;— a significant increase in funding for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces and the conferring of an added educational remit, in liaison with schools and in community settings; and— the expansion of the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau to target and seize smaller assets in local communities with the full resources of An Garda Síochána targeted at organised crime gangs, traffickers and dealers.I send my best wishes to my former colleagues and the children, staff and school community of St. Laurence O'Toole's National School, which I used to teach in, who are opening their new school building today. I believe the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will be opening it. I cannot be with them because of this debate, but they know I love them very much and they are with me always. If we were to invite a family member of every individual who died from a drug overdose last year to sit in this Chamber, we would not have enough room for everyone. This is the most famous room in Ireland and these seats have been filled by famous people over the past 100 years or so. If we were to invite a single family member of every individual who had died from a drug overdose in Ireland to sit here, we would not have enough room. They would have to sit in the Public Gallery. In 2017, 235 people died from drug overdoses. That figure has got worse year on year. We have one of the highest drug overdose rates in Europe. If those family members were to sit in these seats, what would we say to them? I suppose we would want to understand the complexity of the issue and show compassion. We would want to listen to experts, who say that there are overlapping issues of poverty, disadvantage and alienation that lead someone into drug use and addiction. We would want to understand all of that. If we were honest, though, we in the political system would look at those family members and tell them that the people they loved and who died were criminals. This is at the centre of what we are trying to change through this motion. The Labour Party wants to stand with those family members. It wants to stand with those in addiction, those who are suffering and those who are in recovery. It wants to tell them plainly and simply they are not criminals. The criminalisation of drug users is part of a stigma and a shame culture. It is a deliberate act of public policy. It is not drugs that kill people as much as bad drugs policy does. The Labour Party believes we do not need a war on drugs. Rather, we need a war on bad drugs policy. Criminalising and stigmatising people in addiction leads to people in the political system undermining and dehumanising people who need support and compassion. It leads to a then Minister throwing leaflets around her constituency telling her constituents that the newly opened medical centre in her area would not be dealing methadone. It leads to a backbencher using dehumanising language when speaking about someone in addiction. It leads to the most ineffective and absent Minister and Minister of State with responsibility for this area in a generation. The feeling from the political system is that what drug users are doing is criminal and what they are is worthless. It is not just the political system that feels this way. The medical system feels this way too. My colleague, Senator Sherlock, tells me that, in Dublin, only 28% of GPs are involved in the methadone programme. That is replicated throughout the country. It leads to a bizarre situation where, as Fr. Peter McVerry told us on Monday night, people are travelling from Wexford to Dublin to get their methadone. I know this to be true because I once met a woman called Lisa. Lisa was living in Portlaoise. She was a young mother who used to travel by bus from Portlaoise to Dublin every day to get her methadone. The sad thing is that, when engaging with Lisa, I had the feeling she believed she was not worth any more than that and could not demand a better service because she felt on some level she was a criminal and was worthless. We forced this young mother to go from Portlaoise to Dublin every day on a bus to get her methadone. When I called into that centre a number of months later, I asked about Lisa. I was told she had not survived. We killed her. She was not a criminal. She was not worthless. I knew a man called Paul who had a daughter with cystic fibrosis. The Minister of State should have seen the way they spent time together. They loved each other deeply. There was a sparkle in her eyes when she saw him. He was not well and she was not well. She did not make it because of her illness. As a result, he did not make it because of his. He was not a criminal and he was not worthless. The Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 2017. What would any of us say if we came across a dead body following a heroin overdose in a laneway and we held that body in our arms? Would we say to that person that the planning application was tied up in the High Court and there was nothing we could do? People are dying in the alleyways of our capital city but we have not made the necessary intervention to save their lives, that being, a mobile facility implemented through emergency legislation. We are the criminals. We are the ones who are useless. It is our inaction that is criminal, not the actions of those who are dying. Mr. Philly McMahon, a former Dublin footballer whose brother died of drug-related issues, says we need a tribe for change. I can speak of people in this House who are part of that tribe. I remember trying with my Labour Party colleagues to get the injecting centre idea over the line. It was people like the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe of Fine Gael, and former Deputy Jonathan O'Brien of Sinn Féin who were supportive. Even today, I hear people like Deputy McAuliffe from Fianna Fáil making good speeches on decriminalisation. Colleagues like Deputy Hourigan of the Green Party, Deputy Cairns of the Social Democrats and Independent Senator Ruane are speaking seriously about this issue. I think of people like Deputy Gino Kenny, who has been a warrior in this field. We absolutely need a tribe to change this conversation from being about criminality and worthlessness to one that replicates what happened in Portugal 20 years ago when it decriminalised the drug user.After 20 years, it has half the number of people in drug-dependency programmes and has reduced its drug overdose rate by 75%. The Labour Party's call today is quite simple. We stand with those affected by this issue. You are not criminals. You are absolutely not worthless. We need people to understand and to completely recast their view of this debate. The Government has promised a citizens' assembly on drugs. We need to hold establish that assembly because people are dying on our watch. It is our inaction that is criminal.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to give credit to the Minister of State and the work he has done here. He gave a commitment that this legislation would be brought before the House and he has been true to his word. Often in politics, people in his position do not get any praise whatsoever so I will say that much. It can be difficult to wade through all the different responsibilities, find the time to engage with all the stakeholders, produce a piece of legislation and bring it before the Oireachtas. I give credit to the Minister of State for what he has done. With the safe passage of this Bill and with the amendments we hope to bring forward, we will hopefully repair and enhance lives. The Minister of State has been articulating this for quite some time and it is quite clear that in the Bill we are recognising, after many years, the need for strict regulation in this sphere. I congratulate the Minister of State on that. I also pay tribute to my own colleagues. Senator Mark Wall has spoken about gambling possibly more than any other issue since he came into the Oireachtas. He has been speaking on it regularly, he has published his own legislation around it and he has been engaging with stakeholders. I pay tribute to him and to Deputy Howlin, who took part in the pre-legislative scrutiny element of this Bill. It is remarkable, when observing the history of this area of legislation, just how powerful is the gambling lobby. There used to be a levy of 20% on bets placed in Ireland. I do not know how many other industries have successfully lobbied their way from a levy of 20% down to what was 1% and is now 2%.It is also remarkable that the wider lobby of interest groups has managed to ensure the levy on gambling goes exclusively to a fund which is disproportionately spent on prize money people bet to get their hands on. It is bizarre on one level that the levy funds an industry that encourages people to bet. The levy has not heretofore benefited anyone with a gambling addiction. It has not benefited any entity that might provide a different route for young people to stay away from gambling. It does not do anything in the health or education spheres. Every cent of the levy on gambling goes to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. Some 80% of that is for the horse racing industry, of which the vast bulk goes to prize money. Approximately €45 million of tax-free prize money was presented by the taxpayer to the horse racing industry last year on the backs of bets placed on everything. When I say this to people in meetings, they are always perplexed by it. They ask how it happened. It is not only horse racing or greyhound racing bets that accumulate these moneys. Any bet on anything does. All the levies from bets on politics, football or the weather go straight into the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. Therefore I suggest to the Minister of State that we should perhaps go back and consider raising the levy to where it was previously. While 20% sounds like a lot, 2% is certainly not enough and what we would accrue from an increased levy should benefit pursuits other than those that have such a culture of betting around them. You cannot hear of a horse racing in a race without hearing the price of a bet on that horse. You cannot hear about a greyhound meet without betting being referenced. It is almost unique in the sporting sphere in that when we hear about these sporting occasions, betting on them is front and centre of the commentary. It is a little perplexing how the gambling levy and that industry are completely intertwined. As has been said, it is hard to watch any kind of sporting event in the current context without being bombarded with gambling advertising. It is true of television, radio and online. There was a time, when I was younger, when there was some kind of social control on betting. Bets had to be placed in a bookie's office which were only open between certain hours. There was a realisation that people had to physically go to the bookie's office so they had to regulate themselves as to how often they were there, who saw them there, the sense people had of them, how they carried themselves and if they were seen to be in the bookie's office too often. People's families would know if they were in the bookie's office a lot. They had a sense of how a person was spending money or engaging in gambling so they could keep an eye on it. I sound like a very old person making these comments, but the advent of the Internet changed all that. It could now be done online. People no longer had to go to the bookie's office so that social control was more limited. With the advent of the smartphone in the past 15 years or so, that has completely gone out the window. People do not have to worry about social control involved in the physical trip to the bookie's office. No one has to know in any way how, when or how much a person is betting, unless someone has a sense of what is in that person's bank account. People can bet at any hour of the day or night. They can find a way of doing it even if they are children. We are told every hour of the day and night that we should do it. If people have an interest in sport, they are encouraged to bet by the advertisements on the front of the shirts and by entities that sponsor coverage on different broadcasters. It is a swamp that people almost need incredible discipline not to engage in, if they have a phone and are interested in sport in particular. A huge amount of what is in this Bill is welcome, including the regulatory authority and the banning of gambling advertising between certain hours. We will be putting down amendments. Second Stage speeches are a general reflection of the state of play. On the gambling advertising restrictions, we must simply go further. I know the Minister of State has listened to various interest groups and is trying to strike a balance. That is fair enough, but to suggest that at 9 o'clock the influence of gambling advertising will be lessened because of who is watching television, listening to the radio or in the online sphere is not realistic. As has been said, if people who have a gambling habit in their life use their phone during their trip home from the pub, they will probably be more influenced by gambling advertising at that hour of the night than they might be at 1 o'clock in the day. We must have the same view of gambling advertising as we once had of cigarette and alcohol advertising. We have to kill it dead. We must move away from the cultural acceptance of a level of gambling noise. Members will be aware of the clever advertising that is done by various bookmakers and gambling companies. It is clever and can be engaging. It can be witty, funny or deliberately offensive, but as the Oireachtas, we must stand up more strongly and say this equates to alcohol and cigarettes because the damage being done is absolutely incalculable. If this is in a person's life, it takes over everything. The Labour Party facilitated a conversation with Oisín McConville, who said that what young people are now going through which is different from what he went through. The secrecy that surrounds it and the methodologies used are dangerous. I do not accept the bona fides of any of these multi-billion euro companies because their job is to screw people out of their money. As Deputy Daly quite rightly stated about BeGambleAware, it is a pathetic nod to something the companies do not really want to happen at all. As a collective political body, we must put the person at the front and centre of what we are trying to do and put protections in place for the person, for the person's family and for children who will be influenced by this. The world is very different from what it was like when I was a child, when the bookie's office was a place we might go once a year to place a bet on the Grand National. Now it is all around us, on our phones every hour of day and night. It is destroying families and it will only get worse. I get the sense from this area that we are at the beginning of an epidemic, if we are not already there. It is so silent. We will be putting down amendments to strengthen the Bill. The Minister of State is to be congratulated. He flagged this for a long time. He has brought it before the Oireachtas and, in fairness, he has delivered. That is in his favour and needs to be said on the record. It is strong legislation. We feel it could be stronger. The levy on gambling needs to be increased and should fund more than the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund because the ring-fenced nature of that funding deserves massive scrutiny and overhaul. Other sporting entities and pursuits need to be considered. When it comes to the advertising piece, I know the Minister of State has tried to strike a balance, but we need an absolute ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship. They should be treated as dangerous, in the same way as cigarette advertising. If we had that mentality, we might achieve something. I do not agree with this idea that we can open the gates at 9 p.m. because we know, with the money these people have, they will flood our television screens and our radio waves from 9 p.m. onwards. No advertisement other than gambling advertisements will be heard because that is the nature of what they do. With those thoughts myself, Senator Mark Wall and other members of the Labour Party are determined to work with the Minister of State to make this more robust. We certainly have a good start because of the Minister of State's work. We will continue to work with him.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Sinn Féin for tabling this important motion. I welcome those in the Public Gallery who are directly affected by this issue. I can only imagine what they are thinking listening to this debate. Possibly, it is that they have heard all of this before. It is difficult to think of another national scandal that displays the worst of what Ireland is and has been. Moneyed developers maximised their profits, often by lobbying for the political system to bow to them. In many instances, they constructed fire traps. They let people buy these at exorbitant prices and, as has been rightly said, they then liquidated, reimagined, renamed and re-established themselves and never had to take responsibility for what they did. A number of aspects strike those of us who deal with families in this situation. The first is the fear they are living with constantly. They go to bed looking at the ceilings and walls around them that they are mentally at war with because they believe that where they live could kill them. There is a sense of guilt that they are raising their families in apartments that could kill them. The worst part is that they cannot even talk about it because they are worried about the reputational damage the apartment block or area would suffer. They want to be careful in their language in case the media reports on these death traps, leading to the investments they have made and the mortgages they have been paying effectively becoming worthless. It is a devastating set of circumstances. This national scandal has cost lives. I remember a man called Fiachra Daly. At the height of the Priory Hall scandal, he took his own life because of the pressure that he and his family were under. Whenever the history of this situation is written, it will rank as one of the major national scandals in terms of how badly Ireland and politics in this country worked and how much power these developers had to change the political, planning and regulatory systems to get what they wanted and build what they wanted to whatever standard they wanted in order to maximise their profits. As soon as anything came back to their door, they just changed who they were to avoid taking responsibility and kept going. It is remarkable. When you sit down with these families and ask who they can take a case against, it turns out that they cannot because the cowboys who built the homes that could kill them do not exist anymore. The families cannot talk about it because they are worried that the reputational damage will hurt their investments and they hope that some work can be done to repair their properties before they ever have to discuss the situation. It is a vice grip on people's bodies, minds and families. The families in the Public Gallery, those I am dealing with and thousands more are dependent on - I was going to say the Minister, but he is correct - us. They do not want to hear a political squabble, point scoring and us one-upping one another. We are probably at a better stage now in terms of getting somewhere towards resolving the situation than we were in recent years. I do not want people who are listening to this debate in the Public Gallery to go home angry and just angry. They need to go home from this debate feeling that they might get somewhere. When they heard "ten years", I am sure it broke their hearts a little.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I accept that, but we have to be careful. When we speak about timelines, we need to be sure that we can bring people on board and they can have a level of hope. I agree with other Deputies who stated that we must discuss absolute redress and consider the situation retrospectively over the past 30 years or so. We must also ensure as a collective that this scandal never happens again. In the current discourse, it appears that a political representative cannot have an opinion on any planned apartment complex in any part of the country, but it is only fair and reasonable that the political system work to be as critical and strongly observant of what developers do today as ever. I wish to focus on the solutions. We want to work with the Minister in a timely manner and to ensure that funding is available to fix not just these homes, but these lives. We want to ensure that parents who are concerned about their children growing up in entities that could seriously harm them can have the prospect in a short time of resting their heads on their pillows and not worrying. This issue is soul destroying and life defining. Imagine reaching 60, 65 or 70 years of age, looking back on your life and realising that, for 20 years or more of it, you were terrified going to bed every night and waking up every morning and you paid thousands of euro because you did nothing more than make the mistake of trusting someone who sold you a home that they had undergone the process to ensure it worked.The families have heard all this rhetoric before. We want a system that works, that is timely and that is funded. We do not want anyone to have to put their hands in their pockets. We want justice from those entities that did this in the first place. We want to ensure this never ever happens again. It is a national scandal and on the same level as any other national scandal we have ever dealt with in these Houses. It must be treated as such and we must all work with the Minister to get answers and justice for the families present and for any other families affected by this issue. I refer as well to those families who do not even realise they have been affected. In the case of my constituency, I do not even feel as if I can list off the apartment blocks and residents groups I have been dealing with. On one level, I am not sure if they would thank me. This is the level of fear we are dealing with. I hope the Minister appreciates this point. We all have a responsibility to get this right and to get it right soon.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The members of the Government have surpassed themselves today. I was speaking to somebody in the education sphere last week. Our conversation turned to teacher shortages and the person said to me that whatever those in government come up with, we can be sure their plan will put the blame on teachers. Sure enough, as if by magic, just as they are scrambling around to try to find answers to come up with some sort of a response to the excellent motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Gary Gannon, and the Social Democrats, they have done it again. It reminds me of the time during the pandemic when the schools were closed because that was the medical advice, and there was controversy over how we could reopen schools. Despite the fact that the Government was not listening to school leaders, was not prioritising air filtration systems in schools, was not investing in schools and was not providing support for teachers, at the end of the day, when it came down to it, what the Government wanted the parents’ conversations at dinner tables and on WhatsApp groups to be about was that this was not really about Government inaction or about failures of Government, and was not even about the virus, it was about teachers. Then, when it came to the spectacular failure of the Government to find school places last September for children with additional needs, despite the fact it had to ram through emergency legislation at the end of June and it was about Government inaction in that space, what it also managed to do as a Government was to blame individual schools, and teachers and principals in those schools, with one Minister naming four schools. Again, what they were hoping would be said on the WhatsApp groups, at the school gates and at dinner tables was that it was not about Government inaction and it was about these teachers and principals, and, in fact, it was about those four individual schools that were named by that Minister. Again, it was the teachers' fault. Then, today, in spectacular fashion, when every teacher, principal and SNA we speak to refers to the housing crisis when it comes to the teacher supply problem, the Minister of State comes in and reads out a 15-page speech, one page of which is about housing. Then, the Government manages through leaks from Cabinet discussions to put the blame on those pesky teachers and their career breaks. Once again, the teacher supply problem is not about Government inaction or about housing, it is about teachers again. What the Government wants to have in all these debates about school reopening during Covid is that it is kind of the teachers’ fault; or regarding lack of places for children with additional needs, again, it is the teachers’ fault; and now, the fact we cannot get teachers is the teachers’ fault. It is unbelievable. I will tell the Minister of State, flatly and plainly, that the only reason the education system has not completely and utterly collapsed is because of the goodwill and the professionalism of the teachers that the Government seems determined to malign, along with SNAs and the wider school community. Let us talk plainly about what the problem is: it is a housing problem. I do not want to have a debate that pits rural against urban Ireland but let us be frank. The Government is allowing Dublin to die on its watch. We cannot get teachers, nurses or gardaí to live in the capital city and to serve it. Our schools are being bled of talent that could teach these children, and the children feel it and know it because it is they are in classrooms without a teacher, or with a substitute teacher, or else they have a succession of teachers. They know there is something wrong. By the way, oftentimes these teachers, if they happen to have a chance to teach, are teaching children who are also affected by the homelessness crisis and the housing crisis, living with their parents in their grandparents’ house. I know of a particular school, with which I have a personal relationship, where I was told the situation has completely changed over the past 12 years and that 24% of the children are now in homelessness. Yet, when the Government has a chance to respond to today's motion, what does it do? It wants those of us in opposition who are talking about teacher supply to have to talk about career breaks, not about housing. It is unbelievable that it has constructed a narrative today where we are talking about career breaks for teachers, not about housing. I feel that the city I love, the city I grew up in, the city I live in and the city I care about, is dying on this Government’s watch fundamentally because we cannot get nurses because they say they cannot live in Dublin. The Tánaiste seems to think that what gardaí need is a gun rather than a gaff. Teachers are being priced out of the city. We need to talk seriously about a Dublin allowance. It is going to get people in the Rural Independent Group very excited when a Deputy stands up and says that. That is fair enough. They have this in London. When they had a teacher shortage issue in London, they recognised that the cost of living issue in the city was serious and because they needed teachers to teach London kids, it was seen as that important, given the particular pressures in London. Let us talk seriously about it here in Dublin as well. Let us talk seriously about providing a standard of living for teachers in Dublin so it should not be an aspiration for someone to be a teacher and to live and work in Dublin. That should not be outside the capacity of a teacher. The State needs to recognise that and introduce a Dublin allowance. That is a much more constructive idea for the Government to toss around the place, rather than having an onslaught once again on teachers' pay and conditions. I swear to God that if any of those in government, whether in Cabinet or on the backbenches, spent five minutes in a school classroom, they would not be able to survive because of the number of skills and competencies they would need. They should back off from the teachers and their terms and conditions, and realise that what they are doing is overseeing a housing crisis that is pushing teachers out of Dublin and affecting the children of the city. It is not good enough and they need to sort it out.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The purpose of this instruction is to allow the Minister to extend the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill. An increasing trend of the Government is to bring forward new and substantial amendments to Bills going through the Houses unrelated to the original purpose of the proposed legislation. It is not good practice and it hinders our ability to scrutinise legislation. It was used extensively on the Electoral Reform Act earlier this year. This week we have also seen a similar approach to the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is ramming through a planning Bill this week and next. In effect, the Government and the permanent Civil Service are regularly using Standing Order 187 to undermine the legislative process and turn the House into a rubber stamp. According to the motion, the Minister will make a series of legislative changes related to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, and Tusla. A further series of substantial amendments to the right to request remote work are not mentioned in the motion so while the Bill is recommitted for what we might term "a mini-Second Stage debate on specified grounds", it does not include the right to request remote work. By tabling these unscrutinised amendments on Report Stage, the Government has bypassed Second and Committee Stages, therefore, depriving Deputies of the opportunity to address in detail the impact of these proposals. It robs us of time to table substantial amendments to new proposals in this House, which are changed from the original draft law published in January. The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has published its scrutiny of the original Right to Request Remote Work Bill 2021 in July. It is only now in December that a new Bill is in effect being parachuted into this one and it differs from the original proposals in many ways. Since the start of the year we have called for a right to flexible work for all workers. The Labour Party published its own legislation and tabled a motion in the House in our Private Members' time in March where we called for flexible work to be the default option rather than giving employers the right to refuse requests. Results of an Ireland Thinks poll commissioned by the Labour Party showed an overwhelming demand from workers for this right. Some 71% of people believe in the right to flexible work; instead we are getting a right to request it. To take one example, according to the Minister's amendment, someone still must be an employee for six months before they can request a remote working arrangement. It is a key recommendation of the committee that this be removed and that there should be an automatic right to request. Our motion which passed this House in spring called on the Government to ensure its legislative proposals provided that any reason for refusal of flexible work relied upon by an employer must be objectively justifiable, appropriate and proportion. The original Bill included 13 grounds for refusal but instead the Government is now replacing that with an elevating code of practice to be agreed later. Our understanding now is that the employer grounds for refusing flexible work will not be rooted in the primary legislation. We know the gains made by workers during the pandemic on flexible work are being eroded and employers are more frequently demanding that employees return to the office. Measure of this nature require substantially more debate and scrutiny. Watered-down rights for workers should not be slipped in through late Stage amendments. Only 60 minutes have been provided later on Report Stage for more than 20 pages of amendments and the Minister and the Government should not rush this through in such a manner. On Committee Stage, the Minister also said he hoped to introduce provisions to provide for maternity leave for Oireachtas Members. Will he indicate what his plans are for that now?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate my colleague Deputy Bacik on being true to her commitment, at the time of the Dublin Bay South by-election, to introduce this legislation and for dealing with so many local groups. As a fellow baywatcher, I believe this legislation is particularly important for the area I represent, Dublin Bay North. One of the communities in my constituency is grieving today as a result of the laying to rest of a four-year-old girl this morning. I wanted to acknowledge that on the floor of the House today. All of us here will do whatever we can to provide support to the family in what are absolutely heartbreaking circumstances for them and the school community, which happens to be in my constituency. To return to the Bill, we feel strongly about Dublin and believe it deserves protection and enhancement. We feel strongly that lessons have to be learned from the various crises we have had over the years. People returned to the bay at the time of the financial crisis. When people had struggles in their lives, they began to reconnect with what was on their doorstep. They returned to the bay during the Covid crisis, when people may have been locked out of other pursuits. They turned to the bay to walk, swim and enjoy the absolutely fantastic facility of their doorstep. Then they began to realise that it may not be tended to, treated or enhanced as well as it should. At my part of the bay, Doldrum Bay, Howth, raw sewage is pumped in. That has been of major local concern in the Howth area for several years. In Clontarf, one can see the conditions in which the swimmers swim. Clontarf is an iconic part of Dublin. All the iconography and paintings associated with Clontarf are about swimming and the associated sense of enjoyment, yet the facilities are just not up to scratch. You do not have to go to Spain to see enhanced facilities; you can go to Portmarnock, in the Minister's constituency, to see how things can be done – in this case by Fingal County Council. We must not have a mismatch of authorities, from Fingal County Council to Dublin City Council and others, overseeing this incredible facility. Therefore, the Labour Party is suggesting that we need to have a structure over Dublin Bay that will protect and enhance it. In this regard, let me repeat what Deputy Bacik said. We suggest a new statutory Dublin Bay authority. This is not a new idea. As Deputy Bacik has said, it has been advocated for many years by people from many different backgrounds and interest groups. The new authority would be tasked with the promotion of policies for the protection and enhancement of the environment of Dublin Bay and the natural habitats and wildlife in and around it. I can think of how this would enhance my constituency. Another objective would be to promote and support strategic planning and sustainable development in and around the bay and make recommendations to regulate and control pollution, which I have already mentioned, in and around Dublin Bay. In this regard, I have mentioned the Doldrum Bay issue. This legislation should receive Government support. We do not want to hear the Minister state he is merely not opposing it or that he wants to delay the next Stage for 12 months. If we are serious about Dublin and enhancing both the public realm and citizens' life experience in Dublin, we should heed what we learned from the financial crash and Covid and what we are learning from the current cost-of-living crisis. We see people returning to natural interaction with the bay and its beauty and rediscovering it. The sad thing, however, is that they also rediscover just how poorly it has been protected over the years. I asked the Minister not only not to oppose the Bill but also to support the effort behind it and not have us wait perhaps 12 months for the next Stage. I congratulate my colleague Deputy Bacik and all those who have been campaigning for so many years to get us to this point, where we might be at the stage of having a statutory Dublin Bay authority.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Marino. How dare you.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is in enough hot water.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I agree with the Minister. Our country is heartbroken this morning. More will be said about that later but I join with the Minister in his condolences with the family of the lost soldier. Will the Minister make a statement on the ways in which the ongoing review in energy security will integrate sectoral emissions ceiling and carbon budget obligations, his plans to ensure that as-demand reduction measures are prioritised in the review, and the ways in which the principles of a just transition will be integrated into the review?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party has concerns partly because briefing documents prepared for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, which were obtained under freedom of information, reported in The Business Post at the weekend, stated it is not feasible for Ireland to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. We are particularly concerned to see this concession made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Agricultural methane emissions from livestock account for 95% of Ireland's methane emissions overall. Methane emissions from livestock have increased in recent years, not reduced. The briefing document stated the pledge to cut methane emissions allows for individual countries to pledge lower amounts. What is the Minister's view of these briefing documents prepared for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and do they speak for the Government?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Minister knows, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has made it clear a methane emissions reduction of almost 30% is required to achieve a 22% reduction in agricultural emissions, and we all remember the row over the summer in regard to emissions savings. We would have liked to have seen a commitment closer to a 30% reduction. The lower ceiling which is in place instead was accepted on the basis that it could not be exceeded. However, going by this report in the newspaper at the weekend, no credible pathway has been established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to achieve the less ambitious commitment it made. Is it not concerning for the Minister not just that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine clearly is not on board but, potentially, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not on board?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What are the Minister's plans to ensure confirmed data centres connections will not increase emissions? What are his plans to ensure that such connections do not lock in higher gas demands?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ireland could have 146 data centres if all approved projects and projects seeking planning permission go ahead. If all of these projects are completed, the power demand capacity will triple. The disorganised nature of this rapid growth in the sector is problematic for our climate ambitions and for families who are worried about the lights and heat going off this cold and dark winter. The Government needs to institute a moratorium on new connections until it gets to grips with what is happening. Those making these proposals have been labelled as too drastic but power outages and climate chaos are drastic outcomes. It is not just those on the Opposition benches who have been raising these concerns. We hear it privately from Government representatives as well. Indeed, a Government backbencher was making these very same points on national radio during the week.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Minister knows, demand for gas for electricity generation, heating and other uses must fall by 40% this decade and by a further 80% in the 2030s if we are to meet our climate commitments. Despite this, we continue to prepare to build new gas-fuelled electricity generation plants. Even if all future data centres were to run on renewable energy, it would leave shortages of clean energy for other sectors. Gas is wrongly being peddled as a silver-bullet transition fuel. As the Minister knows, the effect of carbon emissions is cumulative. Is it not fair to say that we are locking in this infrastructure without a national plan?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not the case.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach should answer the question about Deputy English.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He did not resign from the Taoiseach's party. He is still in the parliamentary party, getting rounds of applause.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is not what the Taoiseach did.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was good enough for you, Taoiseach.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Make the order.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Come on. This is a total distraction.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They are as bad as each other.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach did it himself. When he leaked the document, he took questions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He is still a Fine Gael Deputy.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his presentation. The Labour Party is broadly supportive of the idea of body cams for gardaí. However, we want to make a few points on this Stage. I was not a member of the justice committee, although I am now, when this Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny. I understand there was no reference to facial recognition technology at that time. I will return to the issue of facial recognition technology shortly but, as a matter of process, it is less than desirable that on this Stage a new element of this Bill is being brought in for us to deliberate on Committee Stage, when it represents a major change in the operation and organisation of An Garda Síochána. I will speak first to the positivity around the issue of body cams. It has been spoken about for a long time. The Government is moving on it and we are legislating for it, which is a positive. We have seen across the world, where body cams on police officers have been used, they have protected police officers, in addition to communities that previously were not believed regarding over-aggressive police forces and the interaction between police forces and their communities. The Black Lives Matter movement was emboldened because it had evidence from individual interactions between police officers and members of their communities and could prove the level of aggression that was there. Body cams will also protect members of An Garda Síochána. Even in recent days and weeks, we have seen the level of protests that are happening in some communities. Members of the public would not believe the type of vitriol and poison that is spouted and spat at members of An Garda Síochána until they see it, either live or recorded. We rightly speak a lot about the abuse politicians and especially female politicians get. It is justifiable to speak out. Such abuse has to be rooted out and ended. There are so many public servants who get vile abuse. Female public service employees get disproportionately more vile abuse. That includes members of An Garda Síochána. We support body cams for two reasons: first, to protect the individual who comes into contact with An Garda Síochána to prove the nature of that interaction and whether the force used by a garda was appropriate and that interaction was respectful and, second, to protect the member of An Garda Síochána, again, by illustrating the type of interaction the civilian had with that officer. However, there is a trust deficit. We all know of the case of a vulnerable woman who was recorded walking down O'Connell Street in a distressed state and that the recording was shared among members of An Garda Síochána. We know that some sensitive material that members of An Garda Síochána are privy to is not treated with the delicacy it should be. Let us put it that way. We have to be clear that whatever recorded material comes from body cams that the Garda has will be treated with a lot of regulation and safeguards and that there will be penalties involved for anybody who transgresses that. If it happened in the case of the woman I mentioned, I am quite sure it has happened previously in other cases. We cannot have a scenario where very sensitive material of interactions between gardaí and individuals in the street is shared inappropriately, goes into the public domain, ends up on a social media site, and we reap a whirlwind of regret because we did not put in the safeguards on this Stage. This is a major change in the dynamic of the interaction between a garda and a member of the public. It is a major change. We have to now, unfortunately, think of the worst-case scenario that could possibly happen from this dynamic and interactional change, prevent that happening, and work back from that worst-case scenario to where we are now. What would we say if, in years to come, some interaction between a garda and somebody in a state of undress or intoxication, or somebody who is well known or whatever, ended up online inappropriately? Would we then say we should have thought differently about the Bill when it was brought before the Oireachtas and whether we should have trusted the Garda enough to ensure the situation I outlined would not happen? Unfortunately, we have to work in the space where in the context of the individual right of the person interacting with the Garda, and that interaction being recorded, we are dealing with citizens who have to be assumed to be innocent of any transgression. If this interaction is now to be recorded, all of us have to be assured that the recording will be treated sensitively, and that it will not be tampered with, released, or end up in the public domain. Again, I support members of An Garda Síochána who are going about their daily work and are in confrontational situations every day. It is a difficult job. On that, it is fair to say we do not have enough gardaí. There are 650 fewer gardaí in the State now than there were three years ago. I am not suggesting this Bill is a distraction. This legislation is needed but within this conversation we have to also point to the fact that it is not a substitution for boots on the ground. The morale in An Garda Síochána has been spoken of, as have the reasons members are trying to get out, are seeking early retirement and are changing career because it is an unhappy place to work at present.When we have 650 fewer gardaí than we had three years ago, that has to be addressed. As for facial recognition technology, none of us want to oppose technology. It sounds great for a Minister to say, "Facial recognition technology is the way to go, the Garda Commissioner says the same thing, and who could be against that?" This is again a massive layer of change in the dynamic of how An Garda Síochána will interact with the public. Anywhere else it has been used it has proven to be problematic. There are districts in the UK where it has been shown that 80% of the cases that have used facial recognition technology have been defective. San Francisco has banned it. I understand EU legislation is being formulated to ban it in every European state. It does not make a heap of sense - this is my understanding of the EU position - for us to bring in legislation that enables An Garda Síochána to use facial recognition technology when it has proven so problematic in other jurisdictions. Meanwhile, the EU is formulating legislation to outlaw it and, therefore, we would be contradicting EU law before we start. That is notwithstanding the fact that the process in bringing it in is, we will all agree, less than perfect in that we are not having pre-legislative scrutiny, going by the Minister's contribution, and we are going to bring it into Committee Stage. Not only is facial recognition technology problematic, my colleagues in Sinn Féin have quite rightly said that it has been proven to be problematic in terms of the people it isolates and targets. There is a racial dimension to this as well, whereby it is disproportionately discriminatory against those of certain ethnic backgrounds. When the Garda Commissioner makes comments about every body cam having facial recognition technology, those are two major changes in one which we need to be careful about. Let me put the position of the Labour Party clearly. We are in favour of body cams on gardaí. We feel they would protect the member of the public and the member of An Garda Síochána. There are major concerns as to how those data will be stored and not shared but protected and kept sacred, as it were, but we will work on that and we have to find regulations around that. On facial recognition technology, however, we are yet to be convinced that this is the right time to bring in this incredibly powerful tool on top of what the Minister is proposing when it has proven so problematic. The Minister will say that the technology can improve, that all these glitches can be overcome and that if we have the legislation, it can be amended in time. We feel that because the technology has proven to be so difficult to use effectively in other jurisdictions that have tried it, because police forces internationally are rowing back against it and because the EU, apparently, is bringing in legislation to ban it, we should not use this legislative process to bring it in. With the body cam there is enough of a change of dynamic between An Garda Síochána and the public for us to work on at this time. This seems to be a bridge too far at this point. We can toss it over and back on Committee Stage and we can bring in experts if the Chair of the committee is willing to do so to disabuse us of our difficulties with it, but there is a big difference between technology that can recognise somebody in a confrontational or criminal act and the recording of a public space where somebody is just innocently walking down the road. The usage of that technology to pursue that person is a different dynamic from the other of the two usages of facial recognition technology. I will reiterate that we support An Garda Síochána. We believe that body cams will assist them in their work. We want to know that the material they would gather would be treated sensitively. We want to be sure that the person being recorded will know that that interaction will not end up on some website somewhere. We also want to be sure that if there is an interaction that may reflect negatively on An Garda Síochána, there will be consequences for the garda who says the body cam just was not working, he or she forgot to plug it in or it went on the blink. There will be massive trust issues in such scenarios. Will there be an expectation that gardaí do not go on the beat unless the camera is working and that they check it before they go out? I can just imagine all those scenarios. On facial recognition technology, will the Minister please investigate what is being done at EU level and what has happened in other jurisdictions before he shoehorns in a major change in the dynamic that has been proven internationally not to work? The evidence we have is that this does not work and that police forces are rowing back against it all across the world. We could bring in legislation that will be useless because it will contravene what is happening in respect of EU law.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Has the Tánaiste seen the protests?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not working. They are finding out before we are.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be remiss of me not to mention today that we laid to rest a former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, who spent many years teaching children from the Oliver Bond flat complex in the north-west inner city. This inspired her to go into politics. She became Minister for Education and delivered radical reforms in that space and inspired people like me to turn to politics. Probably Deputy Nash and I were afforded the opportunity to go to third level because of her radical abolition of fees at that time. I was inspired by what Niamh used to talk about in terms of her school life. It was similar to my own circumstances because, when it came to education, housing was everything. Niamh could only achieve so much with the children who she taught and I could only achieve so much with the children that I taught within the classroom because there was a reality outside of the school which was the homes in which these children lived. There is a middle-class middle-Ireland assumption of how every child lives and it does not equate to the most disadvantaged of communities. Even as the President brings forward this radical suggestion of the abolition of homework and others have talked about it, there is a middle-Ireland assumption of what homework is and how homework is done. I remember, in my school days and school teaching days, the reality of homework was that a child did not have the space in his or her home to do homework. They did not have a desk in their room. They had to do it lying on the floor. Often they had to do it on the stairs because of the overcrowded reality in which they were living. This was 20 years ago, around the time that Fianna Fáil had the brainwave to stop building social housing. Today when I go into classrooms and I talk to children about the nature of education and issues in society and they talk to me about homework, I talk about how sometimes it is difficult for children to do homework because of the homes in which they live. I always see a child whose head bows because he or she knows I am speaking to his or her reality. This is not only me talking about my experiences talking to children. This is me referencing cold, hard figures. The cold, hard figures from last December are that not only do we have 11,000 people in homelessness, but almost 3,500 of those are children. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, can only imagine the life that one will lead if one starts off life in that insecurity of homelessness. We always talk about situations in our own constituency. Last Christmas, my colleague, Councillor Brian McDonagh, and I had to deal with a situation of a mother who was giving birth and had nowhere to go when she left the maternity hospital at Christmas time. In Ireland, one of the richest countries in the world, she had nowhere to go after she had this baby and we had to intervene. We did not do media on it, we did not send out press releases on it but the reality of my office in that week was trying to get somebody with a newborn baby somewhere to live in emergency accommodation for three months. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Government will celebrate the fact that it brought in an eviction ban. The Minister of State trumpeted it in his remarks. The Government resisted it for months. We had people in the Minister of State's position who told us that it was potentially unconstitutional and that the Government had to get the Attorney General's advice. We begged the Government for months and months to bring in the eviction ban and the Government stated it was potentially unconstitutional even though it had been done in 2015. I ask the Minister of State not come here and read out successes that the Department apparently has in terms of its housing response. We begged the Government to do it and we are begging the Minister of State today to do it because we cannot have that insecurity of children, 3,500 of whom are in homelessness, insecure accommodation or insecure rental situations whose mothers and fathers are telephoning us saying that they cannot live like this. The Minister of State will be aware that Barnardos says that 29% of parents are skipping meals to feed their children. Therefore, we have insecurity of food on top of insecurity of housing and the Minister of State is playing around with language about an eviction ban. Let us do now, today, what the Minister of State knows he will do anyway, that is, extend the eviction ban to the end of the year. I ask the Minister of State to realise the nature of the grinding punishment we are all meting out on children when they start their lives like this. It is just not fair.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Minister the reason students who have previously sat a year in a different course were excluded from the €1,000 discount on third levels fees when they are subject to the same cost of living pressures as everyone else.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I very much appreciate the comments of the Minister on the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach. I know her family will as well. One of the radical things she did as Minister for Education was to abolish fees, something from which I benefited, as did many of my colleagues and friends. The debate was lost over the previous 25 years when registration fees crept up. People are now spending thousands of euro a year on fees. Be that as it may, we are talking about a small cohort of students. It was a welcome measure. I know there is frustration in government that when something is announced there will always be a member of the Opposition who will say it is all very well but it should be tweaked more and the focus is on the negative. What the Minister did was welcome and things are going in the right direction. The Minister is making all of the right noises in terms of reducing third level fees to where they were 25 years ago. Does the Minister not feel that an additional measure or gesture could be made from Government to reduce the fees of a small cohort of students by €1,000, in line with everybody else?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Over a period we want to achieve, at all levels of education, be it primary, secondary, third level and further education, a situation whereby nobody has to consider costs when it comes to furthering their education journey. It should never come into the conversation. It is depressing that people always have to think about the cost of education to a family when it should instead be about trying to fulfil their potential. However, when there is a price tag attached and question marks over whether a family or individual can reach that price, we have failed collectively. If he cannot address this now, can the Minister ensure in the next budget recycle, as we move towards a new announcement in September, that all of the loopholes will be dealt with and this cohort of students will benefit? If the Minister could not do it this time, can he commit to reviewing the current system in order that students who start first year again can be included in a further scheme?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Like a 30% tax rate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«So it is a mini-budget.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a short-term budget.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party acknowledges the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in bringing forward a memo to Government on the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs. Deputies and Senators from different political groups feel strongly about the citizens' assembly being a real force for change. We want the voice of the service user, the drug user, to be central to the deliberations of the citizens' assembly on drugs. As a matter of course, a special committee will be set up following the deliberations of the citizens' assembly. That is how these matters tend to play out. Will the Taoiseach commit to viewing the deliberations and findings of the citizens' assembly on drugs in good faith and to the Government moving to implement the findings of the citizens' assembly and the special committee because this is a crucial issue for so many people in our country?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sorry I missed the presentations. I found the witnesses' interaction with other members very interesting. I know Karen McHugh from the fantastic work she does with Doras Luimní. I am at a disadvantage because I am not from a rural area, although I have connections in rural Ireland. For this reason, I cannot tap into large parts of the conversation on agricultural issues. Like everyone else present, members of my family are living abroad and I know what it means to say goodbye to someone in an airport and to have an empty chair at the table at Christmas. I recall having long distance telephone calls with relatives in the United States in the 1980s when I could have sworn I was communicating with someone on the moon. We all know what that was like. I am not a member of the Government. I do not accept that Government does not care or that politicians in power do not care. The current Government appointed a Minister with responsibility for the diaspora and one of the Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad, of which I am a Member, is Senator Billy Lawless, who has been dealing with this issue for some time. On the voting rights issue, in my opinion voting is a real and tangible connection with the country one comes from. A number of years ago when I was on my way to the RTE studios by car I passed the Romanian Embassy. It was a very wet night yet the queue to vote in the Romanian presidential election was unbelievable. This was a wonderful opportunity for Romanian people living in Ireland to have a say in the country of their birth. I am sure if we had the same capacity abroad for Irish citizens in respect of domestic elections it would have the same powerful effect. That sense of connection is very real.  As the witnesses will be aware, one of the topics for discussion by the Constitutional Convention was whether Irish citizens living outside the State should have voting rights in presidential elections and whether that would require constitutional amendment. As far as I am aware, that was recommended by the convention. In the witnesses' estimation, would a constitutional referendum be required in respect of the extension of voting rights in local elections and European elections to Irish citizens living abroad? My instinct is that it would not. What steps could be taken in a relatively short timeframe, outside of a referendum, to allow this opportunity to be afforded to Irish citizens abroad? I have a sister living in London and a brother living in Canada. I know that they would both greatly appreciate the opportunity to have their say in the country they left. Some people leave with a heavy heart and others leave because they cannot wait to get out of here. While all people may not avail of this right the fact that they can do so could mean an awful lot to them.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is the committee to ask the representatives from the National Museum about the current state of play in the museum. The Chairman seems to have a number of very heavily researched questions to fire at these two individuals. If I was in their position I would refuse to answer because it is clear that the Chairman is coming from the position of having knowledge from an individual as to how cases were handled or were not handled. These two individuals are trying to run a national institution, they have a lot on their plate. I do not know how well they are paid or even if they are paid to do that job. To be before a committee like this and to field the questions the Chairman is throwing at them, I do not know if I am on my own here, but I am deeply-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----troubled by what is happening here.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it the proper forum for such questioning?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious that Senator O'Donnell wants to come in, but the Chairman is effectively raising issues of intimidation - I want to be very careful about my language here - and inappropriate sexual behaviour. Would Ms Heaney mind if I asked her how long she has been in this position?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In regard to the issues the Chairman is raising, I do not know if they have been resolved, settled or are ongoing. I have no knowledge of them. I think it possibly would be more productive - this is my instinct and other speakers can make their points - to speak of what happens from now on, with a newly appointed chairman and people working with the museum as to how they address the broad set of cultural issues.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Even if we had, I do not think I would be speaking about it here.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Cuirim fáilte roimh gach éinne atá anseo. I have great experience working with many of the people here as a former Minister of State at the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and together with Equity and other trade unions to try to get collective bargaining rights for freelancers, an initiative with which we had some success. I wish to make some general comments which people might then reflect on or answer. As the Chairman has done, I give great praise to those who are brave enough to come forward to talk about their experience in the arts world. The Waking the Feminists movement was particularly strong in this regard in talking about gender inequality in the artistic world, particularly the field of drama. I attended a gender equality conference a number of years ago and I remember being very taken by a contribution by, I think, Rachel Lysaght, a moviemaker. She said 75% of the moviemakers in Ireland are male and, therefore, 75% of the storytellers through film in Ireland are male, and that has an impact. First, I would like the witnesses to talk about gender equality in the sector in its totality. My first question is what practical measures are being put in place to ensure we have gender equality on boards and as a live issue in every facet of the work people are doing, not just in oversight, but also in production? I was taken by the Arts Council's comment that it is not a regulatory agency. I understand where it is coming from but I was also interested to hear that Equity was very impressed with the interaction it had with the Dublin City Arts Office, although it is not a regulator, and its view of the different work it was overseeing or funding. My second question is whether issues of gender equality, the workplace, policies and procedures that are in place, and governance have to be taken into account before departmental funding, be it through the Arts Council or otherwise, is handed over. Should the Arts Council, even though it is not a regulatory body, not always be conscious of this? Do people feel that the arts is an area that leads to the cult of the individual? The cult of the individual can be positive but is often a very negative thing when an entity becomes synonymous with the person leading it and then the person becomes almost all-powerful and very difficult to challenge. Is this more prevalent in the arts than in others areas and, if so, how can it be tackled?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Do the witnesses wish to address my question on the cult of the individual?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I have to leave at 12 noon so I hope they do not mind if I move on. I have a brief question on the submission by Mr. Arkins. One paragraph in it states: "It is our understanding that those on freelance contracts are not covered by the legislation [I believe he is referring to the 1997 Act] and do not meet the definition of "worker" under any of the various pieces of employment legislation." We passed legislation last year on the collective bargaining rights of freelance workers. Would that legislation have dealt with the issue Mr. Arkins referred to in his submission? He said it was his understanding, but has he looked at that legislation and does it cover the type of vicarious work to which he referred? Is it something that is still finding its feet, so to speak, in terms of the industry in which he is working?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Go raibh maith ag na haíonna as a bheith anseo agus cheap mé gur cur i láthair an-suimiúil go deo a bhí ann. In the political sense there is often a lazy analysis that culture and heritage are the same thing but they are very different. Heritage is what came before us and culture is what exists now. The first presentation was interesting on how we can connect heritage with contemporaneous issues and Mr. Starrett mentioned housing. How do we fight for heritage as a political priority? Whenever we go abroad and put the face of Ireland to the world, heritage icons and arts and culture are to the fore but when we take budgetary measures at home they are way down at the bottom of the list. I was very taken by Ms Clerkin's comment about the heritage officer being a one-person heritage section in each local authority. That was a strong comment. I know the witnesses might be constrained about how they answer my question but I would be interested to hear their response. I taught for a long time in the inner city in Dublin. The heritage there is very different to that in the text books the children are handed. Their heritage is housing schemes, flat complexes, the docks, tuberculosis. It is a different way of life. When I was in school I could have recited every Land Act from 1870 but I was not necessarily as well versed in the housing schemes that came out of World War One or with what happened in tenement Dublin. How do we connect heritage with every type of community in Ireland? Ireland is not homogenous, there are different elements to the Irish nation that have a heritage that people need to connect with fully to make it theirs. That involves reaching out to disconnection, disenfranchisement and disadvantage, making Irelands of everybody, if one likes, that it belongs to them.  I am tickled that Mr. Starrett mentioned housing. When we try to rejuvenate a listed building – I am thinking of a flat complex in Ballybough - we cannot redevelop it because it is a listed building. How do we strike the balance between something that is worth saving and treasuring without it being an aloof aspiration which is not solving the needs of the day? How can the witnesses help us help them? How do we make heritage real to every community, particularly those which are disenfranchised, disconnected and disadvantaged and to new communities? How do we help heritage solve issues?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I am not a member of this committee. I am substituting today for Deputy Burton because I have an interest in this area. I believe that the education system perpetuates inequality. In a system that is based on competition, as ours is, one will find in any community or geographical area a school that is the least popular and in that school one will generally find a disproportionate number of migrant children, Traveller children, children with special needs and children expelled from other schools and so on in order that other schools do not have to facilitate them. We stand over this because we want to have within the system what is known as parental choice, which if one talks to anybody from the Nordic countries, particularly Finland, is a strange priority. It is bizarre that we still separate children on the basis of religion and gender at the age of four years, as has been well articulated here. My question for the witnesses relates to the constitutional issue often thrown at me during my time in government, in particular in the context of an amendment to section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. It is bizarre that it is still legal for a school to discriminate against a gay teacher or a teacher who is an unmarried parent. We were only able to amend that provision rather than delete it or have it removed from the Statute Book because it is a constitutional provision. A number of speakers have spoken about the constitutional provision and have offered their interpretations in this regard. The Department refers to this provision in the context of the baptism bar. I would welcome the views of the witnesses on that issue. In regard to the Irish language question, Deputy Burton and I have tabled an amendment to ensure a situation does not arise whereby an Irish-speaking family would not be able to access its local Gaelscoil and would be forced to have the child educated through English. As Irish is the first language of this State, that is a reasonable provision to have in the Bill. Generally speaking, I believe our system is radically unfair and unequal and that, in terms of this Bill, all we are doing is tinkering with the system. That we are providing by way of this Bill that people, because of their royal blood lineage, should be allowed to send their sons or daughters to the schools they attended is bizarre. I do not understand how any school body with a sense of equality in their ethos could stand over that bonkers provision. It goes against everything I feel is right and just in life. I recall visiting a particular part of the country, which I will not name, and the local representative showing me with great pride a newly built Educate Together school, a newly built Catholic school and a newly built Church of Ireland school, which means that, in terms of education, children from that area are spread across three different schools. Is this the ideal? Is it what we want for the children of this country? I am a great supporter of the Educate Together model. There is an Educate Together school in my constituency, which I welcome. I worked very hard to help bring it to fruition. The Educate Together model is needed because the overall system demands it because it is broken, in my view. I accept that point is more of a rant than a constructive one. The joke about the Department of Education and Skills, which is probably unfair, about how many Department of Education officials it takes to change a light bulb comes to mind, the joke being around the Department's lack of ability to change. In terms of the constitutional issue, how would the witnesses convince the Department officials to change their view or that of the Minister on that question?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I enjoyed my time as Vice Chairman of the previous committee and look forward to working with the Chair and other members.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The previous committee had this conversation at length and came to the conclusion that 9.30 a.m. was a suitable time.  It would allow us to meet for an hour before business commences in the Houses.  Even though it initially proved difficult to get people in at 9.30 a.m., it eventually worked to good effect.  It is not an unreasonable time to expect members to be here and I suggest it as a starting time.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I suggest that 9.30 a.m. is a viable option that should be considered.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Some members of this committee were not members of the previous committee and I understand that people have different points of view.  In the previous committee, the meeting was at 9.30 a.m.  We got used to that time and it worked.  If we are going to work, the morning is the best time.  Attendance at committees can be a problem at every committee.  I do not say that I am better than anyone else.  If we are trying to get work done, 9.30 a.m. is one hour before the Houses sit and it worked best for the previous committee.  I do not really see the reason to move from 9.30 a.m to 10 a.m., notwithstanding the difficulties Deputy Butler is having.  A half hour at that time can make all the difference.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Cuirim fáilte roimh gach duine, go háirithe Tomás Ó Ruairc.  Tá sean-aithne agam air agus tá sé go deas é a fheiceáil anseo inniu.The PR problem has been articulated widely, as has the fact that only 8% of teachers participated in the last election to the Teaching Council.  Reference was made to the fact that the council hopes to address this.  Mr. O'Dea talked about the fee so I will not talk about it again.The stated purpose of the council is to promote teaching as a profession.  How is this being achieved?  The second stated purpose is to ensure the continuing professional development of teachers.  How is this achieved?On entry-level requirements for teacher training, particularly at primary level, there is a conversation on the need for higher-level mathematics.  Higher-level Irish is currently required.  Does the Teaching Council believe this is still necessary?  Is it, as I believe, a barrier to the entry to the teaching profession of disadvantaged students?  Should we not place more emphasis on the capability of teachers as they leave teacher training than on their attainments on entry?   I would have major qualms about a stipulation requiring teachers to have higher-level mathematics.  What matters is what teachers deliver in the classroom, not what they get in their leaving certificate examinations, considering that points are so high in any event.With regard to teacher training, particularly at primary level, there is considerable emphasis on Irish and religion.  In the study on the practices in Mary Immaculate College, it was discovered that four times more time is spent on religion than science and technology.  How does the Teaching Council hope to address that?  The president of the college, in his opening remarks, made it quite clear he had no intention of addressing the imbalance.The role of the principal in the probation of teachers is controversial.  I do not have an issue with it but wonder how the Teaching Council believes it will address it.  How can we address homophobic bullying and LGTB issues?Reference was made to the fact that there will be an entire strand on special needs and education for the disadvantaged.  This is very welcome.  Traditionally, many teachers who entered disadvantaged schools or dealt with special needs children were completely unprepared.  In future, circumstances will be different, which is very welcome.Does the Teaching Council believe it is realistic, particularly at primary level, to expect somebody to enter a college of education at 18 years of age, completely separated from all other strands of education, as occurs at present?  Trainee teachers are in a cocoon separating them from university life.  They study for three or four years – it will soon be four – and then, at the age of 21 or 22, land in a classroom of children of various backgrounds and expect to be capable, for the next 35 or 40 years, of demonstrating life experience and being an effective teacher.  If one is trying to be a teacher in a classroom, having been cocooned for three or four years does not result in adequate preparation.  I would like to hear the Teaching Council's response to that.How does the Teaching Council believe its role in the handling of complaints against teachers will marry with section 24(3) of the Education Act and circular 60/2009 on the suspension and dismissal of teachers and principals?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was trying to suggest that in any other degree course, people mix with others doing agriculture, architecture, arts etc. but in teacher training, people are on their own and surrounded only by people doing teacher training.  In embedding the classroom in students, I am not sure that is the best process of teacher training.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On a point of order, we are dealing with a pre-budget briefing and the matter raised has nothing to do with it.  The Deputies have other avenues in which to raise such issues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know that it is convenient from a journalistic point of view to raise the issue now.  There are other avenues within the Oireachtas in which to raise the issue.  It is not a pre-budget briefing matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Chairman to communicate on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister's attendance to discuss the budget with plenty of advance notice.  I will touch on a few of the issues and perhaps the Minister can give me some response.  I understand he is under pressure of time.  I raised the potential for a national book lending scheme, particularly at primary level, with the Minister previously.  He made a valid point about the way second level is going, with technology like tablets and digitisation.  Such a scheme could have a major impact on the cost savings for parents.  Where is the Department on that and what is its potential cost?  Is there an education audit right across the system?  Often campaigns or issues within the education system are politically convenient but when one strips them down to look at their educational value, sometimes a case can be made for one or another.  Does that happen in terms of issues such as modern languages or class size?  Where a lobby group is making a strong case, what systems or mechanisms are there within the Department to state what international research shows?  Returning to the ability of principals to manage their schools, about which Deputy O'Brien spoke, the compartmentalisation of grants to schools and the autonomy of a principal to make a decision on how to run his or her school the way he or she wants in tandem with the board of management, one may get a block grant for IT which one may not need and would much rather spend on day-to-day items such as toiletries.  The Minister might comment on moving towards a system where the principal would have the autonomy to make those decisions.  I will return to the Minister on the special needs issue.  I still have major concerns about GAM and that funding is not targeted at the most disadvantaged, but this is probably not the proper forum in which to raise that issue.  Senator Healy Eames touched on the reform packages.  In terms of the literacy initiatives, the forum on patronage and pluralism and all of the reforms that the Department is thankfully carrying out, it is quite an exciting time to be involved in education.  Is the added cost of doing all of this a major budgetary item?  Does it have a major impact on the spend of the Department?  When the Minister rolls out a new scheme or initiative, he takes on a vested interest or he takes on a body of work that has been left untouched for a period of time and there is a cost involved.  Is it a major or minor cost?  Is it something that we need to focus on?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«As we have a quorum, I call the meeting to order.  At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, I ask members to ensure their mobile telephones are turned off completely and not left on silent mode for the duration of the meeting.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  I propose we go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.
The joint committee went into private session at 10.05 a.m. and resumed in public session at 10.10 a.m.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for attending to discuss this issue.  The premise is that we want to come up with solutions and work together.  This is not a finger-pointing exercise but a collaborative approach to finding solutions.  The suggestions made have been practical and positive.  On the issue of books, DEIS primary schools receive €21 per student and non-DEIS schools receive €11 per student.  Some 25% of schools are not running book rental schemes.  Can the patron bodies give me an indication of why that is the case?   I am interested to hear about the Educate Together policy of no uniforms in schools.  Do other patron bodies provide direction, make suggestions or have policies on the issue of crested jumpers, jackets and tracksuits?  Has a policy framework been devised to encourage and direct schools in respect of uniform policy, as Educate Together has done?  I am a former school principal and I am a believer in school uniforms for various reasons. They reduce peer pressure. My personal opinion is that there is also a health and safety aspect to the wearing of uniforms. As has been outlined, some parents must go to a particular store to buy a designated jumper. That puts a cost on the uniform, which is not necessarily fair in any circumstance, particularly not in the current circumstances. On the question of voluntary contribution, everybody present admits that schools are, and always have been, chronically underfunded. I do not believe anybody will deny that. The manner in which voluntary contributions are collected is the issue. If somebody has the means and wants to contribute to the school and wants to contribute to a fund-raiser, be it that we should not be required to have fund-raisers, that is all very well, but there have been suggestions and indications given to public representatives that schools are being quite aggressive in targeting certain students and parents telling them they have not returned their "voluntary contribution". Will the patron bodies give a direction to the schools as to how that should be done properly? It may sound silly to raise the issue of Christmas presents. Every year it comes up it is suggested to parents to give a present to teacher. Can we give directions to our schools to stamp out that unnecessary practice? There are the small little pressures that come up every year or at the end of year. The witnesses have made very practical suggestions on public procurement and workbooks, on capitation payment at the end of August and September and on bulk buying. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made a suggestion in regard to VAT on energy consumption and I believe that is an issue we can work on. We have benefited from this conversation and I appreciate the contributions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have moved towards discussing the cost of running schools.  I understand the progression in this regard but we are trying to focus on the costs parents incur when their children return to school.  Many speakers have indicated that this is a local issue, particularly in the context of schools' policies on uniforms, etc.  However, members would be encouraged if our guests took a leadership role in respect of this matter and sent out some guidelines to schools with regard to what might be considered appropriate for investigation at local level.  I understand that our guests' hands are tied but their showing some leadership on this matter would have an impact at local level in the context of policies relating to school uniforms, the giving of presents to teachers, etc.  Children giving presents to their teachers might be regarded as being no big deal or even frivolous but it has an impact on families at various times throughout the school year.  If we state that this should be decided at local level, then we are not showing enough leadership.  I am of the view that guests should take the lead and issue some guidelines.  However, it is entirely up to them to decide what they wish to do.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  It is great to see Mr. David Connolly, in particular, at a meeting of this nature.  The witnesses referred to the need for meaningful engagement on this issue.  What engagement has there been until now and what would they consider to be meaningful engagement that might lead to a resolution of the problem?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I, too, welcome Mr. Clark and wish him every success in his new role.  I urge him to use the resource of this committee if it can be of benefit to him in his new role.  If he wishes to discuss elements of the challenges that face him, we would be happy to do that.  This forum tends to be non-party-political.  Every member of the committee is committed to education and, as Deputy McConalogue said, we are trying to get through a huge body of reform.  Often the challenge is to bring people with us and to face up to accusations of reform for the sake of reform.  When one considers what is happening at primary and second levels and the Bill going through the House at present, there is a huge amount of change and there is much concern surrounding that change.  If this committee can be of benefit to Mr. Clark, engagement such as this would be very important.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the representatives of the TUI and NALA for being here today.  The TUI submission is remarkably extensive and it will probably take some time to digest the variety of issues addressed.  Due to time constraints the delegation was not in a position to go through them in greater detail.  Nevertheless, I understand the sentiments expressed.  I welcome the representatives from NALA.  I will be tabling an amendment to get an adult learner on the ETBs.  Literacy is a civil right and it is one of the greatest issues in our country at the moment.  We must complete the circle but we have no real potential to tackle the issue of literacy from all stages of education and the life cycle unless we get the life experience of an adult learner who has dealt with the issues so eloquently outlined by the NALA delegation today.  I will table an amendment and I hope it will be accepted and that NALA will have an adult learner on the ETBs.  I believe that is justified.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I happened to be knocking on doors when this announcement was made.  When I arrived at the doorstep of an individual who worked for DIT and gave her the good news, she hugged me.  That was the first hug I got since I became a Deputy.  I thank the Grangegorman Development Agency for arranging that.  I formerly represented the Grangegorman area on Dublin City Council at a time when a considerable number of development projects were being planned for O’Devaney Gardens and elsewhere.  Many of these projects never came to fruition, with the result that a level of cynicism had developed within the local community.  Around the same time, a major redevelopment of Phibsborough shopping centre was proposed, which gave rise to concerns about the impact on traffic and transport.    It is an exciting prospect that all DIT’s different educational centres, which are currently dotted around the city, will be moving to a central location on the northside.  I ask, however, that the agency bring the local community with it because it has already experienced disappointments with previous projects.  We will do what we can as local representatives to ease the process.  I ask the witnesses not to be strangers to this committee because we want to engage and provide whatever support we can.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The easiest way of quietening agitators is to put them in the chair.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Who is the provider?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the officials for attending.  I will be brief because many of the points I wanted to raise have already been made.  Moving from 66 awarding bodies to one was always going to be problematic.  It was always the case that there would be teething problems.  Nobody has a difficulty with that but most members did not expect so many problems.  Members throughout the country are inundated with representations from exasperated applicants.  What message does the delegation have for those students who are considering dropping out?  I received a communication from a gentleman who told me he has already dropped out of his course because of the delay in processing his application.  What message can SUSI give directly to students or the third level colleges on the issue of dropping out?  I do not want it on my conscience, nor do the delegates want it on theirs, that somebody's educational potential will be limited because of a glitch in the SUSI system.  Nobody wants to stand over that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegations for attending.  Focusing in on the ESRI prediction of an increase of 16% in third level numbers by 2020, how does the HEA intend to meet that challenge?  Has the authority any comparative figures on the higher demand for university places from international students?  Our seven universities are in the top 500 in the world.  It is often suggested each individual university is fighting its own corner rather than collaborating together.  If Harvard and various other universities in the United States can collaborate, why can more of our own not do the same?  Has the HEA concerns about standards in distance and online learning?  There is a concern within the third level sector that we are churning out a large number of trainee teachers who are swamping the system but there are no posts for them.  Is there a danger this might also happen with the roll-out of online learning?  How can we maintain a standard and proper inspection system around that?  There is an obsession with league tables and The Irish Times recently had an article about which schools are more successful, allegedly, than others.  The number of clarifications and corrections subsequently printed by the newspaper since that article has been alarming, with many schools bending over backwards to inform The Irish Times about what really happens in their own individual schools.  Do we leave access initiatives to individual colleges?  Has the Department and the HEA a centralised approach as to how we can encourage those from more disadvantaged backgrounds to enter access programmes?  Is it recognised that some schools find it more difficult than others in this area and that in some schools to get a student through the leaving certificate is a greater achievement than getting a doctorate?  Is there a centralised policy with access or is it left to the individual colleges and the goodness of their own hearts?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it possible to get those figures?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentation. I am sorry I was delayed. This is an important issue. I get the sense that the Roma people - I understand there are 15 million of them across Europe - are people that nobody wants as a result of which they are poorly treated wherever they go. My understanding is that there are approximately 5,000 Roma in Ireland. Pavee Point has been dealing with this issue for a number of years. What is the witnesses' sense of a national strategy or policy response to the issue of the Roma community, their needs and entitlements? What must be done for them? Is it the case that the State effectively wants the issue to go away or pretend it does not exist? Has anything ever been written down on paper that suggested how to address the wants, needs and requirements of the Roma community? Deputy Ó Snodaigh touched on the EU-wide context and that we have the Presidency. Am I right in understanding that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, suggested that one of the priorities for our term is how the EU would tackle this issue? The witnesses might comment on that. Ireland has reported to the United Nations on our progress this year on the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In terms of Roma children being punished because of this State's instinctive distrust - that might be too strong a statement but it probably is accurate - of the Roma community, what implications will that have regarding the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the report the State must make to the UN?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It might be useful to also engage on the matter with an official from the Department of Social Protection because of the nature of the overlap of responsibilities.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unfortunately, I am in between two committee meetings - this one and the Select Sub-Committee on Finance, which is dealing with the Finance Bill. If the Minister wants to respond to some of the issues that have been raised, I might come in afterwards.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes. I thank the Minister for attending the committee and I apologise for being late. Four of us were over in Finland last week. It was fascinating to see the difference between what we have - which is effectively a State-funded system - and what they have, which is a State system. In Finland, all children in a particular school district attend the one school. It was interesting to see that children there do not start school until seven years of age. They stay in the one continuum of education from seven to 16, so that the traumatic transfer to second level does not necessarily take place. It was also interesting to hear some of the buzz-words they were using, such as "trust". Teachers are trusted because they have a high standard of education themselves and all have masters degrees. There is not a big inspection regime and there only seems to be one state exam at the age of 19. I deliberately asked what they would think of a system which had girls and boys being taught in separate schools, and all wearing school uniforms. I got the predictable response of puzzled faces looking at each other and asking, "Where is this place that you speak of?" It was Ireland, of course. We had a meeting with the Finnish Parliament's education and culture committee. A conservative MP told us we had to understand that the most important thing about the Finnish education system was equality. While Finland is an interesting dynamic, we need to address a few things in the Irish education system. Deputy O'Brien rightly referred to back-to-school costs, including school books. As regards the relationship between the State, the Department and patrons, at what stage can we encourage patron bodies to have a more active role in running individual schools and in policies? We have a problem with an over-supply of primary teachers. The new Hibernia College is churning out a huge number of highly qualified teachers but there are no jobs for them. There seems to be no level of regulation, so does the Minister have a comment to make about it? It is unfair to have a system that produces so many teachers when there will never be enough jobs for them, regardless of budgetary measures that change from year to year. There is a huge volume of work involved, given the list of reforms that are taking place. The junior cycle is a great reform and the focus on literacy is very important. The issue of fee-paying schools is quite current and the report has only just been released. The Minister may not wish to comment on it but the report has debunked the simplistic argument that if expenditure on subventing teachers in those schools was withdrawn it would save us €90 million. The Minister has been increasing the pupil-teacher ratio in those schools over a period of years. I suggest that such a progression over the years would ease the reliance of those schools on the State, but there will come a tipping point for many schools which may find themselves going into the State system. We have to talk about teacher morale. I visit schools regularly and talk to principals and teachers there. For whatever reason, they feel as if the political system, the media or society in general does not appreciate them, does not feel they do a good job or feels they are not worth the money or holidays they receive. That is a complete contrast to what we discovered in Finland. Perhaps Irish teachers have always felt this way but particularly in recent years - I do not think it is particular to this Government or the previous one - they have felt undervalued by society. It is difficult to drive reforms if people are not coming on board and are not empowered by the process. At what stage can we have a quantifiable status as to how successful, or otherwise, the national literacy strategy has been? These strategies are put in place - often with the best will in the world and for justifiable reasons - with major research behind them but we need to be sure we are doing the right thing. Is there a strategy in place to take account of what is being done and achieved, and whether we are going the right way about it? 
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will now call the meeting to order. Apologies have been received from Deputy Joanna Tuffy. At the request of the broadcasting unit, can members please ensure that their mobile phones are turned off completely for the duration of the meeting and not just left in silent mode. For the information of members, the broadcasting unit will broadcast the public session of this meeting live. The proceedings will be carried on UPC channel 207. We will now go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We are resuming in public session and I am conscious of the time. I once heard a story about a fellow who, when he was told during a public meeting that the Deputies had to go to the Dáil Chamber to vote, said "We did not vote for you to be in the Dáil voting". It is part of the job. I apologise for the delay. We welcome the officials from the Department of Education and Skills to discuss whole school approaches to mental health and bullying. The Children's Mental Health Coalition will give a presentation on these two topics. I welcome the following: Margaret Grogan, regional director of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, who will give a presentation on mental health; Deirdre McDonnell, principal officer, central policy unit, who will give a presentation on bullying; Doreen McMorris, assistant chief inspector; Frances Shearer, national co-ordinator social and personal health education support services; and Hubert Loftus, responsible for teacher allocation and school governance policies. I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statements the witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the same parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make changes against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Ms McDonnell and Ms Grogan to make their opening remarks.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Due to time constraints I might bank some questions. I call Deputy O'Brien followed by Deputy Bannon.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Can we focus on questions, please?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Interagency collaboration was mentioned. What has been the input of the Special Education Support Service and CAMHS to the various guidelines produced recently on bullying and mental health strategies? Continuous professional development for teachers was touched upon by Senator Moran. With regard to NEPS, a number of schools have access to private assessments. How is NEPS focusing on the schools that do not? Is there a policy in this regard? What I experienced, which may have changed in the two years since I was in the classroom, was that clinical assessments in respect of behavioural problems were not offered through NEPS. Is there a policy to change that such that children with behavioural problems may be assessed? Senator Moran referred to the new four-year Bachelor of Education qualification and the two-year higher diploma qualification. Is there capacity in teacher training for greater emphasis on anti-bullying and mental health strategies?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have that question.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious of time and that two more speakers want to come in. However, I want to get more clarity on my question concerning clinical assessments. If, after a school goes through every possible intervention to benefit a child's needs, they are crying out for a clinical assessment, would NEPS provide that?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Does anyone wish to comment before I bring in the final two speakers?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«In fairness, I did interject. I am sorry.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have three minutes. I know that Deputy McConalogue and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien will keep their comments brief if they can.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I do not wish to cut across the Deputy but I am conscious of time.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«In fairness, Deputy, I am conscious of time. It is 2.10 p.m.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Witnesses should be brief in reply. If they wish, they may forward replies in written form.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious that Deputy Butler asked about boards of management. Can that be touched on?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am very conscious of time. We have gone way over.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«If the Deputy gives the witnesses an opportunity to speak, he might get an answer.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I must put my foot down. We have all had an opportunity to ask questions.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will ask the guests to conclude.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Members are anxious to continue this discussion and flesh out the issues. We will try to invite the witnesses back at the earliest opportunity. Unfortunately, we have three different presentations from three different groups today and our time is short. I thank the witnesses for their presentations. Before they leave, I acknowledge Daniel and Donald from Drimnagh Castle who are leaving the room. They have been heavily involved in setting up an anti-cyberbullying website in their school. I welcome the representatives of the Children's Mental Health Coalition. I look forward to their presentation.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have three presentations today and I wish to conclude this section of the meeting at 3 p.m. We want to get the maximum out of the encounter. I urge members to be mindful that they should ask questions rather than make statements. A variety of people are present with different expertise to respond to questions.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«That is more of a statement than a question.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Okay, but quickly.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Ms Leydon was asked specifically about the mental health issues in the teaching body, and Ms Clarke was asked about the area-based approach and the strategy in Ballymun. Does Ms Leydon want to respond to that?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious of time.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will come back to the Senator when Ms McClorey has responded.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We agreed earlier to finish this section at 3 p.m. There are people outside who have been waiting two hours to come in. I must be fair to everybody. I call Ms McClorey.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The next speaker is Deputy Jim Daly, followed by Senator Moloney. I ask members to be brief.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Perhaps the delegates would respond to Deputy Daly's questions on the teacher training colleges and children in care.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Who wants to take that question? I call Deputy Butler but he must be very brief.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Okay.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for attending. This is an issue we will have to come back to. From a school perspective, the various agencies they must deal with and the responsibilities that come under Departments, be it Health, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs or whatever, is frustrating. We will send on the presentations to the Minister for Education and Skills but we will ask Department of Health officials to appear before the committee to give us more insight into how we can overcome the difficulties. I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations. I am sorry the time was short but we got a huge amount from the presentations. We will suspend briefly while the next witnesses come in. I ask members to remain if they possibly can do so because those making the next presentation have been waiting two hours.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Dr. Don Thornhill, Mr. John Church, Professor Oliver FitzGerald and Dr. Robert Ryan. I also welcome officials from Arthritis Ireland to discuss with us the costs of absenteeism in the workplace arising from musculoskeletal disorders. By virtue of section 17(2)(l ) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

I invite Mr. John Church to make his opening remarks. I apologise for the delay in taking the presentation.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I fully agree with Dr. Thornhill.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am quite stunned by the figures Dr. Ryan has cited. Committee members will pose questions, but there are no representatives of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or the Technical Group here. How were the figures of €750 million a year for 7 million lost working days and €280 million spent on illness benefit arrived at?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Are we talking about a recurring illness - not something that will go away overnight, but one that will dog somebody for a considerable period of time?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Is it the single biggest cause of absenteeism through sickness in the workplace?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«A Seanad vote has been called. The delegation has outlined a particular problem and the figures are very stark. I am impressed by the wide coalition of employers, unions, experts, patient organisations, etc. Has the potential solution been costed? Knowing the cost could determine policymakers' reaction to it.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Is there potential to go from public sector department to public sector department initially? It was stated large corporations might be better resourced to roll out the model before the establishment of a national plan. Could this approach be considered first?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«This is a cross-party committee of the Oireachtas that invites witnesses to discuss subjects such as that under discussion. Has Mr. Church had any face-to-face contact with departmental officials or Ministers with regard to his body of work and research?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«It can be a difficult challenge for something like this because the committee structure here is so compartmentalised. Even the previous presentation would have gone between committees dealing with health, children and education. However, Mr. Church is here from the social protection viewpoint and is focusing on those savings. Are there any further comments in summary?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«What helps Dr. Thornhill's case is that he has identified the problem. If this is the No. 1 reason why people are missing work, then obviously it is something that has to be corrected. All of us on this committee believe that early intervention is the key in most areas of policy. Dr. Thornhill has identified the costs. In his initial presentation he said he was looking for champions in this regard. A champion will always be asked the hard questions - for example, if one has a model for intervention how much will it cost? That body of work will have to be done in order to get the cost structure fine-tuned.  The suggestion of going Department by Department, sector by sector or through larger private sector entities first, is a good one. Dr. Thornhill said that having 50% of employees in small or medium-sized businesses might not necessarily be the way to go yet. I certainly think we should keep in contact with each other. We often have presentations here with a good engagement, but the relationship may not be built up or we do not come back to see where it has gone. After Dr. Thornhill has met the Minister and the conference has been held, perhaps he could communicate again with the committee. We will certainly circulate the presentation and post it on our website.  Anyone who has heard today's presentations will certainly be convinced by the validity of Dr. Thornhill's argument. I thank him and his colleagues for attending the committee. 
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«In conclusion, I wish to thank our guests for having briefed us so comprehensively. We will send their presentations to the Minister for a written response on the issues that have been raised. I wish all members of the committee a happy Easter. The committee now stands adjourned until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 April 2013. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the guests for being here. I have been working on this report for some time and we have heard presentations from the patron bodies, which were interesting as well. Submissions have been received from various bodies and they have been well received. There are two issues. The first is the costs themselves but the second is the capacity of a parent to pay them. We need to consider both issues. Naturally, we need to consider the capacity of the parent to pay, but fundamentally we should ask why these costs are there in the first place. We have always had the problem of the cost of sending a child to school being unnecessarily high. When we had money, we did not focus on this issue properly. During the boom times we made other political priorities. There is a cultural question at issue. As Mr. Finlay rightly noted, we should go back to the Constitution and the value of having a free education. We have lost the sense of that ideal. Perhaps we need to have a discussion among ourselves as a society about that cultural shift. The idea of holding a fund-raiser for a Garda station sounds ridiculous but we have no difficulty holding a fund-raiser for a school or a hospital. People in Scandinavian countries would find that rather bizarre. Part of the problem is the nature of competition between schools. The value system that underpins our education system is one of choice, and that is fair enough. However, it leads to a level of competition between schools. My school must offer something the neighbouring school does not have, because I need a certain enrolment in my school to keep my staff complement as it is. I would not be keen to lose numbers to the neighbouring school and, therefore, I may prioritise a nicer jumper and the ability to offer X, Y and Z. I do not understand why we stand over a system that puts pressures on parents to fund outings such as ski trips. When did the idea of a ski trip become an integral part of the educational journey that a person needs to travel during secondary school? These questions have to be asked but there are more fundamental things we need to discuss. I was quite taken by what Ms Lynch said about the fundamental relationship between the parent and the school being undermined, because it is increasingly becoming a financial relationship rather than one based on education and learning.That is an incredibly powerful statement. We have a problem of authority. As Mr. Finlay said, we do not have a State education system, rather we have a State funded education system. All the patron bodies came before the committee and were asked what they believed was their responsibility in terms of book and uniform policies. Each and every one said it was a localised issue and each independent board of management made an independent decision on uniform policy, and they had no overarching responsibility for it. That has to be challenged. One patron body, Educate Together, said its philosophy was to have no uniform and was able to ensure all its schools have that policy. I do not know whether that is a cost for parents, but if it can have a policy for its schools, I do not see why other patron bodies cannot do the same. We have to be more inventive with school books. I agree with Ms Deane that this does not need to be something that happens next September. We could have a vision of something happening over ten years and gradually come to a situation where a book rental scheme is introduced in every school in the country. We could deal with core textbooks first and then move on to other areas of the curriculum. There has to be buy-in from all the different agencies involved in education. I ask the delegates to give me a sense of the responsibility patron bodies have for individual boards of management and principals who play ball. It was suggested there are schools where principals and parents work together quite strongly to find solutions while others are not playing ball and are happy to communicate the exclusive nature of a school in a community, that the school is difficult to get into and has high standards, and therefore that there are costs to getting into such a school, such as a payment of €70 to enrol a child, which I have heard from parents, or the requirement to pay a voluntary contribution. There may be a role for local authorities in terms of what the local library service can do about books. The policy regarding uniforms needs to be challenged. I ask the National Parents Council Post-Primary to refer to the digital revolution that is occurring at second level. If a principal decides every first year pupil has to have an iPad, what strain does that place on the parents with whom it deals? Is enough direction coming from the Department on what is happening independently of any strategy it has implemented? Does it ask for the educational evidence that an iPad is needed? I am led to believe that if one reads something in print, it stays with one longer than if one reads it on screen. These things are happening without any management, policy-wise, from the Department. How can we work with schools to ensure it is not just fashionable for every secondary school student to have an iPad? Those are my basic thoughts. I look forward to trying to put as much of what the delegations said into the report as possible, and to having some fundamental demands in it which will achieve something. I do not want the report simply to say the situation is terrible and has to change without having a strategy for how it can be changed. We should not expect change to occur in September but rather over a period of time. Everybody, including the Department, patron bodies and the boards of management of primary and secondary schools, needs to take their responsibilities seriously.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My question is: how can we challenge that? All the relevant parties appeared before us here and stated it was an individual localised arrangement.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is an honest question. I do not know how they feel we could-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue of competition between schools is a driving factor in many of the unnecessary burdens that are placed on parents. Although the central issues here are voluntary contributions, books and uniforms, there is a legislative way we could go down in terms of changing the relationship we have with patron bodies. Patron bodies guard their independence as sacred and the responsibility of the Department is merely to fund them, pay for their teachers, fix their buildings and leave everything else to them. We must change the nature of that relationship. The Finnish position is completely different because there is no competition between Finnish schools. In the school district, there is one school. They do not have a tapestry of 3,500 primary schools which they must fund, light, heat, insure, etc., which is what we spend much of our funding on. While the Department must do what it has to do, there is a responsibility of leadership on patron bodies and individual boards of management that could drive down these costs. There must be a cultural shift. We should be reverting to the ideal of free education and it should not be culturally acceptable for some of these practices to be allowable within the school system.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The report will be at the beginning of June.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am in the interesting position of facing a former lecturer and a former school inspector of my own school. I will have to hedge my bets a bit.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is very useful to have people from both sides of the debate to discuss the issues, because I think everybody present is extremely passionate about the subject of history. Is there any evidence as to why the class divide in England became more pronounced in the choice of history as a subject than in any other subject? I suppose part of the debate concerns compulsion versus opportunity in terms of the provision of history in a school. It is interesting that only 50% of schools require students to take history as a junior certificate subject; the assumption that history is compulsory does not stack up. The statistics provided by Mr. Kevin McCarthy are fascinating; some 54,000 students take junior certificate history and geography, but twice as many students take geography as history at level certificate level. There seems to be a problem with history that must be addressed in some way. We are obviously discussing whether these proposals provide an answer. Is there a sense that the history examination at leaving certificate is too onerous? It is at least 20 years since I was in the school system - sometimes, in fairness to politicians, one is trying to comment on the system from memory - but I remember that in the leaving certificate the history exam was a writing race, more necessary than the exam. Does the history examination have a reputational problem at leaving certificate level? People have spoken about enthusiastic teachers, but fundamentally one needs enthusiastic students. One is trying to find a balance in giving the students the opportunity to learn something, but what if they have no interest in the subject? We see what has happened to the Irish language. I am a great believer in the language and I have a degree in Irish, but the major policy failure of the education system, going back to the 1920s, is the teaching of Irish. It has worked for some people but it has not worked for the vast bulk of people. There is a suggestion that Chinese might be offered instead of history. How many schools offer Chinese? Is that a choice that is not necessarily fair? Will the vast bulk of schools not find it easier to provide history as a subject choice at junior certificate level than Chinese, classics or Jewish studies? Is that not the reality on the ground because of the number of people who have the capability to teach history? There is a great opportunity, certainly now that a second year of study is being rolled out for the higher diploma in education. The decade of commemorations was mentioned. I can remember every land Act from 1870 to the Wyndham Act of 1903. However, I did not know very much about social history until I went to Dr. Ferriter's class and learned about TB and the housing crisis in the 1940s. The linear history of Ireland and the national struggle has a history of overtaking the history syllabus. I want to comment on the depth of our study of the social problems and tensions behind history rather than the dates.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We could speak to them through a video link or get someone to come from Northern Ireland.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have a quorum, so I call the meeting to order. Apologies have been received from Senator Healy Eames, who has said she will be late. At the request of broadcasting and recording services, I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are turned off completely and not just left on silent mode during the meeting. The broadcasting unit will broadcast the public session of this meeting live. The proceedings are carried on UPC channel 207. We will now go into private session to deal with minutes and correspondence.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock. Before we commence, I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee. If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an individual or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it easily identifiable. I advise also that submissions and opening statements will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would just like to make a few comments. I understand the reason for the order and the constitutional framework under which it is being introduced.It is appropriate to say that the very basis around which we train teachers means that, in effect, it amounts to a sectarian head count throughout our teacher training colleges, and it is important for us to investigate this properly. We still have far too heavy an influence from religious institutions over the education system. It is the fundamental ethos that is in the training colleges and the vast bulk of primary and secondary schools. Any progressive, forward-thinking and enlightened society would view what we are doing today - putting aside a number of training places in a college for people of a particular faith - as particularly weird. Religious background should be of no relevance to anybody if a person wishes to become a teacher. Unfortunately, we are still standing over a position where if a person is becoming a primary school teacher in this country, unless that person is willing to pay over the odds by using the Hibernia College online course, he or she must tick a box on religious faith. Applicants to the majority of primary schools must also answer a pretty invasive question on faith and what religious ethos the person will stand over. I have no difficulty with what is being introduced because it is, on the face of it, in line with the Constitution and without a constitutional change, our hands are tied. Nevertheless, we should have a conversation about what we are asking of our young teachers and continually providing for in this State and Republic. Effectively, the most important thing that seems to be asked of any individual is about religious background. That relates to teachers, students and other practitioners in the educational field. It sticks in my craw that we return to the issue repeatedly. I respect the position in which we find ourselves but will the Minister of State comment on whether an amendment is in train with regard to the Employment Equality Act? It would argue that State-funded religious institutions - either hospitals or schools - should not discriminate based on somebody's sexuality or private life if it could conflict with the ethos of the body. How would that have an impact on training colleges?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unfortunately, I must leave to attend another committee meeting. I have no option but to do so as it is a select committee. I will throw a few grenades and run, if that is okay. I thank the delegation for the presentations and I am interested in some of the comments made that half the Protestant primary schools in the country could be closed. There was also a question of values and a suggestion that Ireland is a rural country, as well as the issue of competition between schools and the percentage of schools in deficit. I am coming to this partly as a politician but also as somebody who used to be principal of a small school, although it was not in rural Ireland. There are different perspectives in this regard, including the perspective and individual ethos of the small school and what is being achieved for the children under care. One can consider the pressures we see in this committee, with people from the likes of the fee-paying sector coming here asking for more resources or trying to state their case in that regard. Teachers are also keen to maintain pay and pensions, which is their right, and the issue of class sizes is also a common theme across the education sector at primary, secondary and third level. Most recently we had the issue of special needs etc., so there is much pressure on the education system. When I was made principal of a school, the best bit of advice I got was to dig deep into every decision and ensure it is rooted in what is best for the child. If a decision must be made that is sometimes unpopular or unpalatable, if teachers or parents do not like it or if the board of management needs convincing, one will always win out or have a better chance of winning if the decision is good for the child. We have already heard accusations of anti-rural agendas or that this report has an impact on one faith over another. Fundamentally, across the political sphere we are trying to provide an education system at primary and second level that benefits children most. The committee visited Finland recently, which was fascinating as every child goes to a school in a particular district. We met with a conservative member of Parliament who is the chair of the education committee there and she gave us a friendly lecture about the importance of equality in the education system. The conservative Members of Parliament in Finland are far to the left of anything we have here in Ireland, as we noted when she spoke of the importance of equality. What is the value system here? It is of choice, with a matrix of 3,500 primary schools around the country, all of which must be maintained, built and restructured by the Department of Education and Skills. They must be staffed, lit, heated and insured. These are schools in an urban and rural setting. With regard to the schools in my constituency I sometimes ask where is the educational research indicating that girls' and boys' schools should be separate or that infant and senior schools should be separate, even when they are on the same campus. Why does this make sense? There is always a vested interest arguing that girls' or infant education is more important, for example, or that the small school around the corner should not be touched. Ultimately, a slightly bigger school with more students will have resources feeding into it, and it is much more sustainable to have a number of schools - either in an urban or rural setting - that are easier to finance and much more sustainable in the long term, with greater numbers of staff and students in classrooms. A greater number of educational resources can flow as a result. The biggest expense in the education system that should be questioned is not special needs, class sizes, teacher numbers or remuneration but rather our insistence on maintaining this matrix of primary and secondary schools across the State based on different patronages. I know this is an uncomfortable conversation for people and the delegation will not agree with my comments. I am thankful that as soon as I finish my contribution I will have to run. Nevertheless, there must be a question over the fact that we have, as a State, outsourced education to patron bodies, with the primary ethos in our education system a religious one. Over 90% of our schools have religious patronage, which may decide that it is right for parents to send their children to school given a certain religious background, etc. This means that the State, in underpinning that right, must spend more money on maintaining structure. In different rural or urban parishes, there will be a different matrix of primary schools that must maintain an identity. It is not a simple issue and I wish we could have a palace of a primary school in every parish across the nation, with a magnificent building and staff, along with fantastic resources. Something must give, so what should the education system or the Department do? It should not give in on class sizes, special needs or any other issues related to children. Should it give in on having greater centres of excellence in a wider geographical area, which every child could attend and which would have the best of educational supports? That vision may have to be provided by the educational system. Unfortunately, part of the problem in this regard is that we may be representing measures that do not show a wider vision of what we could provide. After throwing these issues into the mix, I thank the delegation for the contributions. I appreciate the conversation. There was mention of the back-to-school report and I look forward to the response of the delegation to it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are votes taking place in the select committee.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her presentation. I was relieved the word "fraud" did not feature heavily in it. Often when we talk about social protection budgets, the media seem to be obsessed with the word" fraud".  The Minister concentrated more on the importance of the social protection budget to the local economy, which I would like to emphasise. She mentioned the basic rate and how important it was in tackling poverty. Does she agree that when one maintains the basic rate of social welfare, it acts as a basic underlayer for the economy, which benefits everybody because everybody's wage rate in the economy is based on the lowest level? When one maintains the lowest level in the social welfare system, everybody in the economy benefits.I think people are sometimes not aware of this. I wish to ask a final question and do not want to take up too much more time. The issue of unemployment and the payment of unemployment assistance from the social welfare budget affect the community as well as the individual. There are multi-layered problems in the geographical areas that have been hardest hit by the economic downturn. Some communities are disproportionately dependent on social welfare. They are disproportionately affected by reductions in city council budgets because they depend so much on local authority services. They are also disproportionately affected by changes in youth service provision. Has the Department made allowances for this? In the context of the 2014 budget, is the Department thinking about how both the community and the individual are affected by the knock-on effects of reductions in payments?  I thank the Minister for her presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the Senator referring to the newspaper or the weather?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and officials for being here. It would be ideal if we could insulate the education budget from any adjustments this year. There has been much success in the past number of years in the maintenance of class sizes across the board. Special education has effectively been ring fenced and there have been developments regarding the pay and pensions issue within the education budget, which takes up a large chunk of it. Much has been protected. Overall expenditure on special education is €1.3 billion. I know this can be a difficult and delicate subject to raise but we have an imbalance where schools in slightly more affluent areas get a disproportionate amount of the resources and schools in my constituency with a poorer demographic do not seem to be getting the same cut of that €1.3 billion because they do not have access to private psychological assessments. Is there any sense that we need to reform that expenditure to ensure that those who really need that expenditure get it? Deputy McConalogue touched on the capital assets test. I have not seen the figure but I think about €330 million, if not more, is spent on student grants every year. Again, there is a problem in that system in that it does not funnel the money to those who really need it because we do not have a test that adequately takes in the assets of somebody who has a magician of an accountant, who can maintain their child's maintenance grant despite the fact that they have large assets. There are two large elements there could be investigated.  The debate around fee-paying schools is sometimes more emotive than based on reality. There is no figure of €90 million that can be easily yanked from the fee-paying sector because these schools do not get capitation grants because if this was to happen overnight, a number of them would come into the system and it is as not as easy as saying that there is €90 million that could be easily spent somewhere else. It is not as simple as that. However, we must focus on the 92% of schools within the free system that are totally dependent on the State. If we were to ask them to feel the pinch, we should do so. Notwithstanding the fact that it is not as simple as taking €90 million away from the fee-paying sector and putting it somewhere else because it would not work out that way, there would be some savings that could be made by disproportionately increasing the pupil-teacher ratio as we have been doing in the past number of years. I do not come to this trying to find easy answers. The suggestion that special education resources are not going to where they are most needed, that student grants are not being spent the way they should be or the issue of fee-paying schools are difficult subjects to raise but we are in the business of asking hard questions and finding solutions. In terms of class size, what we have achieved so far must be maintained. The money spent on special needs assistants and resource hours must be maintained. Everybody across the board must make the point that we value the teaching and the professionals involved in our education system who are dealing with huge pressures, undergoing huge change and reform, are being asked to do much more and are dealing with children, students and families who have suffered hugely in the past number of years. They are holding everything together.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be a great reform if it could happen.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Very much so.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be brief.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the witnesses. I have two questions, which are along the lines of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's point regarding funding models and what works best. Professor Buckley mentioned classroom assistants and attention in the classroom and, in this context, I have a background in education and am doing some work at present. I refer to the interaction of the classroom or special needs assistant with the child and the potential dependency in that regard. Professor Buckley should expand on this because I have dealt with situations in which a child has been allocated a special needs assistant, SNA, it has been a wonderful experience and the child has really benefited from it. However, I have experienced other situations in which the child actually has regressed and become more dependent and it has not been a success. Does Professor Buckley have a template on what is best practice in this regard? Second, Professor Buckley may be unable to answer this general question but perhaps someone else can. What is the status of the witnesses' interaction with the Minister on this broader question?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know Professor Buckley does not.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«One would not be playing children off against each other either.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I apologise as I must leave to attend another committee meeting.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Mr. Delaney to the meeting. SOLAS is charged under the recently enacted legislation with the responsibility of rolling out a national literacy strategy. I mention this because the committee has had a discussion about the dynamics of adult learning and adult literacy in Ireland. That was reinforced by the results published yesterday by the Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies, PIAAC, which indicated that 17.9% of Irish adults aged between 16 and 65 have a basic reading problem - that is, they are at or below point 1 on a 5-point scale of literacy proficiency. SOLAS's predecessor, FÁS, did not even have an adult literacy policy.There is now a commitment to rectify that stitched into the legislation. I would like a full and detailed response on what Mr. Delaney envisages in this regard. All members feel strongly about the empowerment of those from 16 to 65 who may have been let down by the system or for whom it did not work. It should be part of the authority's remit to dig deep to discover the reasons behind that and find a strategy that can overcome the problem so we can improve the statistics. I congratulate Mr. Pat Delaney on his new position and look forward to working with him.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which I found interesting. My interest in compiling a report on this partly arose because the question of special needs assistants, SNAs, arises at budget time and is then forgotten about. We need to have a discussion about the role of SNAs beyond budgetary corrections. I hope in a few years time we will not be speaking about budgetary corrections. The service has expanded a huge amount over a relatively short period of time. Every presentation suggested the role has changed and needs to be re-evaluated. A suggestion was made that roles should be differentiated or we should have a better definition of what the role is. My interest in this was also partly inspired by a trip I took to the IMPACT special needs assistants' AGM, where I saw the effect working as a special needs assistant has on the individual. Special needs assistants sometimes experience a lack of respect from members of the teaching staff, principals and boards of management. They are sometimes asked to perform menial tasks which are completely outside what they envisaged the job to be. They want to be better trained, have job security and have a career in education. Many schools need special needs assistants very much but, given the fact that the role has expanded beyond what the NCSE envisaged, perhaps we need to re-evaluate the role in totality and see if we can recast it for another person working in education. If everybody in the committee came to this with a completely open mind about what a special needs assistant, an educational assistant or somebody working in the education system could be, perhaps it would be an exciting process of complete re-evaluation. What we spend on special education has increased from €450 million in 2004 to €1.3 billion now. Increasing numbers of children present with special needs, which creates challenges in the system. This year we have seen an 11% increase. I am making a statement of intent rather than asking a question and I apologise for this. I am very much taken by the presentations. Everybody will accept that, like the Seanad, the role of the SNA does not necessarily need to stay in its current form and perhaps it should evolve. Sometimes when one speaks about examining the role of SNAs, the people themselves wonder whether they will be undermined and whether it will be suggested that their role should be eliminated from the system. It is quite the contrary. We need to focus heavily on the lack of career structure and certainty the average SNA has in the system and the respect the system gives them, which comes from the Department and filters through boards of management and principals. There may be a question in what I have stated but I wanted to set out the stall as to where we are going with the report. Perhaps we can publish a draft report, after which people can come back to see the type of discussions we are having. We could really get something out of this process.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My question is for the Chairman. Are we going to seek more submissions from the public and from different groups and what dates are the meetings on those submissions? What period of time is being allowed for the acceptance of submissions from interested groups?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for the presentation, and much of what I was going to say has already been ably put forward by colleagues on the committee. It is great to see such a uniformity of views around the issues at hand. I welcome the general scheme of the Bill and there is much to recommend it. Much of it is broadly welcome but it comes around to the same issues, and I may reiterate what has already been said. The age issue will be a problem but this Bill needs surgery and not butchery. Nevertheless, if the Bill remains as it is, it will open many legalistic and constitutional minefields, and it could spend much time in the courts. We can view this as a rolling process and work with the Bill as it goes along rather than viewing it as an end product that must be accepted or rejected. It would be better if we worked in that manner. The divorce issue is constitutionally questionable. As others have stated, the family is at the heart of the Irish Constitution and suggesting that the State would force a family to break up and divorce is questionable. I can see a case being taken at the High Court or Supreme Court and being won easily in that respect, although I am not a constitutional lawyer. That is taking into account the way the Constitution is written and the interpretation of the Constitution through the years. As Ms Phillips has correctly stated, a referendum can be accepted or rejected so it is a constitutional nonsense to wait for same-sex marriage to be accepted. The idea that the State would force a couple to dissolve marriage against their will would not have constitutional standing. Every piece of legislation going through these Houses must adhere to the Constitution. I am taken with the presentations from TENI, LGBT Noise and other groups with regard to children's issues. I am also mindful of the advice from the Ombudsman for Children. There is a legalistic problem with the age provision, and many would advocate that there should not be an age barrier at all. The recommendations for the group between 16 and 18 are highly questionable. Are we really advocating a difference of opinion between somebody's gender identity and what somebody else says? That could give rise to much legal and constitutional argument. Perhaps the next point is minor in the legislation but the piece regarding sport borders on bizarre. Who are we, as a legislative body, to recommend to sporting organisations who can play a sport. That is a strange, odd, unnecessary and slightly offensive provision. We are still trying to amend legislation from 12 years ago that was introduced in good faith to allow certain bodies the right to "discriminate" on the basis of religious ethos in employment law.We are changing this because the context has changed. Such provisions are unnecessary, bizarre and offensive. In as much as it is very strange for the State to require a couple who are very committed to each other to divorce in these circumstances, for it to specify what sport a person can or cannot play is objectionable. I am interested in hearing the reaction of delegates to what my colleagues and I have said because we are very much in agreement. The broad point I want to make is that my hope is that we have started a process and that we do not have a fait accompli. I hope we have a rolling process in order that the Bill can evolve and be amended and changed. Instead of the Government making a definitive decision on the statutory age, I hope there is leeway for it to be altered. If the Bill remains as is, without the surgery we can do here, it will be butchered when a case is taken in a constitutional court. We should prevent such butchery from happening by amending it here.

This meeting is devoted to the important issue of the youth guarantee. The committee considered this matter earlier in the year, on foot of which we decided to submit a political contribution to the European Commission. Since then, as agreed by this committee, work on this matter has been undertaken by Senator O'Donnell who, following today's meeting, will endeavour to draw up recommendations for the committee regarding the implementation of the guarantee. The youth guarantee is an EU initiative that was agreed by member states earlier this year. Once implemented from 2014, it will assure young people aged 18 to 25 a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship of work experience within four months of becoming unemployed.

It would be a shame if the witnesses' presentations were not televised and available to the media and on the Internet. The quality of them needs to come across. If people turn off their phones completely it will make their presentations better. Finally we have a joint contribution from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I want to give Ms Dunne some time as well. Mr. O'Connor is six and a half minutes into his presentation. Will he summarise the rest of it to give adequate time to her?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have one hour and 20 minutes left. I ask members to focus on questions rather than statements. They have three minutes each and they should indicate the groups or individuals to whom they are directing their questions. We want to get as much out of this conversation as we can but we must be out of the room by 3.40 p.m.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Mr. O'Connor was asked a specific question.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Most of Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh's questions are directed at the Department. In the interests of time, rather than asking every group to respond to every question, I ask delegates to indicate their interest in responding to questions.
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Does Mr. O'Connor wish to add anything?
AodhanORiordan« Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Ms Dunne indicated. I will then allow further questions.

I wish to thank the representatives from the Department of Social Protection, Ballymun Job Centre, the National Youth Council of Ireland, Tipperary Regional Youth Service, USI and ICTU for their helpful presentations to the committee. Senator O'Donnell will continue with the work in this regard and the matter will come before the committee again in due course.  The joint committee now stands adjourned until tomorrow morning at 10.30 a.m. when we will give further consideration to the general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013. The meeting will take place in room A, LH2000. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The idea behind the report was to move the debate on the cost of going back to school away from an annual airing by journalists in August and September which is then forgotten about to a constructive pragmatic approach to the annual struggle that families face to meet these costs. Nobody is denying that the funding to schools has decreased in the past number of years as a result of the crisis in the public finances. The joint committee is trying to open up the conversation on the issue of back-to-school expenses. We launched the report in June and have invited the relevant bodies to come before us again. There have been welcome initiatives. The decision on admissions policies is welcome. I hope the payment of an enrolment deposit will be outlawed. The recommendations on the school book rental scheme have been well rehearsed. An announcement on school uniforms was made during the week.  An issue that I would like the panel to respond to is the competition between schools. There are 4,000 schools throughout the State in a country with a population similar to that of Manchester. Obviously schools are under pressure to boost their enrolment figures. As a consequence, schools must present themselves to be more appealing to the parent body. That is the reason extracurricular activities are put to the fore, crested jumpers come into play, and iPads are all the rage. I would like to hear the witnesses' reaction to that. I think many of the suggestions that have been made are sound. We must have a deeper discussion on how schools are funded. The reason for introducing a finance committee into the mix was to give a clear picture of the financial constraints or pressures on an individual school and whether the money is spent appropriately. If a school does not have the resources to provide heat and light there is obviously a fundamental problem with the funding mechanism of the school and that has to be made known and transparent. The Department must be made to take responsibility for fixing it. It should not necessarily be the case that a school should have to have a fundraiser. The body that has responsibility in this area must deal with the issue.  Following on from Deputy O'Brien's comments, I too am disappointed with the submission from the JMB. We are trying to develop a collaborative approach to finding answers. The tone of the JMB document is all wrong; it is bordering on sarcastic, and I do not think it is constructive. There is a leadership vacuum in the JMB. If the members of this committee were to take a similar attitude in the topics we deal with, nothing would ever be done. To suggest that the JMB has no voice when it comes to a policy on uniforms would strike most committee members and parents as bizarre. We all know and accept that schools are under pressure. We also know that parents are under pressure. It is the responsibility of all of us to try to find solutions. For the JMB to produce a document which in my view is dripping in sarcasm, to offer no concrete, practical, positive or generous solutions and to suggest that the committee is not living in the real world and to abnegate responsibility for the cost of uniforms that are being used by individual schools under the patronage of JMB is surprising. If that is to be the level of engagement with the committee, I ask the JMB to revisit and be a little bit more generous the next time its representatives come before us. This issue will not go away.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was a general comment and people may respond to it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Before I make some quick comments, I must apologise. With the way this place works on a Wednesday, we have to be in 14 different places at the one time, and as soon as we get into an interesting discussion, we are told we have to leave. I will make some comments and I hope the witnesses can excuse me at that point. This has been an interesting discussion. I welcome much of what has been said. The witnesses have been open minded and have spoken about teachers being excited about elements of what has been proposed. We must acknowledge that change is needed. The junior certificate, as it stands, is not relevant to the modern era as we cannot ask 15 year olds to get a certificate in order that they might go out to the workforce with it. That is an old-fashioned idea. Some people are failing in the education system, particularly young men. Many of them fall out in second year of secondary school. They might not fall out in body and they might still be enrolled, but they certainly are not fulfilling their potential. Something has to change, not just in the teaching but also in the learning. That is where we are coming from with these changes. I take on board what has been said today. Nothing can happen in education without empowering teachers. Nothing can happen in education without bringing everybody with us. I know that from my experience. We had the History Teachers' Association of Ireland before the committee, and one would swear from media commentary that we were banning history in every school in the country. When we dig deeper into the statistics, we find that only 50% of schools in the State have compulsory history at the moment, but 90% of them study history at junior certificate level. We find that 54,000 students are doing junior certificate history and geography, but twice as many are doing leaving certificate geography than doing leaving certificate history. Sometimes something is presented and a narrative begins, but when we examine it a little bit more, it does not seem as simple as initially presented. In respect of the Irish Heart Foundation, what is being suggested will happen would be a negative. What is the current situation in physical education? Is it adequate? Are schools doing it? I know of second level schools, especially girls' schools, where it seems to be more of an option to opt out of physical education. We need to broaden the argument about obesity. We need to start talking about hunger. One fifth of children in this State are going to school or to bed hungry. It is not necessarily a resources issue. It is a chaos, dysfunctionality and lifestyle issue. That is part of the overall discussion about food, helping our children learn and the lifestyle choices parents and individual families make. When the witnesses talk about a lack of reaction on the part of the political system to that, I point out that we spend more on breakfast and school meals than we ever have before, at €37 million, but part of that is a wider discussion about children coming to school hungry at primary and second level. I want to say one thing about the Irish Human Rights Commission.Approximately two years ago, I went to many second level schools and talked to junior certificate students who had just done the examination. They told me that the one subject they had question marks over was civic, social and political education, CSPE. They enjoyed it but they took the view that not enough time was given to it, that it was not structured enough and that it was not going anywhere. This was their view, not mine; the subject was not in the system when I was in school. Anyway, there is great potential for the subject in respect of turning children into citizens and not simply economic units. I fully agree with the deputation in that regard. One frustrating aspect of this building is that we discuss the economy and money so much and human beings as economic units. Really, we should be discussing turning people into citizens. I accept what the deputation has said about a vehicle or subject like this. However, as Deputy McConalogue asked, rightly, how does one balance so many different subjects and values within the education system to try to achieve what we want to achieve?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be brief as I might have to leave. Unfortunately, many meetings take place on a Wednesday.  I have the radical idea about Irish education that children should be taught together. Many people in the education sphere consider that idea incredibly radical and that it could never be achieved. A minority of schools manipulate their admission policies to keep certain children out. For that reason, the suggestion that a cohort of schools be allowed to admit children on the basis that their parents or grandparents are past pupils is not good enough. How can one compete for admission to a school if one's parent did not attend a secondary school, if one's parent attended secondary school but not in Ireland, if one is from outside the State or moved from a different part of the country?That sort of thing must be removed in its entirety. I accept that 25% is a move in that direction but it is not enough.  There are situations where parents with a child with an educational need, from an ethnic background or a Traveller background are told by a principal we would love to take the child but there is a school down the road that has all of the lovely resources and can provide a much better education. There is effective segregation whereby school A is very monocultural and school B, for whatever reason, must face many challenges.  Glacaim go bhfuil ceist ann maidir leis an Ghaeilge. Ar bhonn bunreachtúil, ní féidir iachall a chur ar thuismitheoirí atá ag tógáil a gcuid páistí le Gaeilge na páistí sin a chuir chuig scoil lán-Bhéarla. Glacaim le sin agus sílim go bhfuil argóint láidir ag na finnéithe ansin. At the same time it is important, when using the spirit of the legislation, to be as generous as possible. I do not want people to use that spirit in a wrong or negative manner. We must construct an educational system that does not have an incredible competition to keep certain people out and does not allow other people in. Sin ráite, glacaim leis an méid atá ráite ag na finnéithe agus gabhaim buíochas leo as a bheith anseo. With regard to the broader question of ethos, I have great sympathy with what Atheist Ireland has said. I shall outline an outrageous situation that exists in my constituency and around the country but perhaps it is not as acute in an urban context because people are more mobile and, therefore, have a greater choice. One is confronted with a situation where one is told that if one baptises a child in a faith that one does not share he or she will be allowed into the local school. That is not in keeping with the ethos or vision of a modern republic. That is completely outside of the vision for a modern republic that a parent would and is being told if their child is not baptised it will be organised. As a local Deputy, I have been presented with such a scenario. My response has been to say that at present, unfortunately, the schools have a right to do so.  Let us be honest, most schools work hard to be as inclusive as possible, to care for the children in their care and to give them the best education that they possibly can. However, there are schools who manipulate their admission policies to keep out Traveller children and immigrant children, to keep children with special needs out and to keep children with certain disruptive backgrounds out. We must be sure that when we construct a new admission policy that every school adopts that spirit in the right way and not manipulate it in the wrong way. Go raibh maith agat. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The guests' presentations were probably some of the best we have had at this committee, considering that they are members of the public and not necessarily spokespeople for a national organisation.  We must totally re-evaluate our education system as often as we possibly can.  We do not do it often enough.  Our education system is something we have inherited from the past.  We as a committee visited Finland and if one talks to anybody in Finland about what is the underpinning ethos of their education system, they all know what it is.  It is equality and they will constantly remind one that it underpins their education system.  I do not think that we have re-evaluated what ethos underpins our education system.  It possibly is the choice of parents - our ethos is what guides our education policy - and that is something with which I personally am not comfortable.  I have a problem with the obsession we have in Ireland, for historical reasons, of linking education with religion.  When I became a school principal the first thing I was told was to pare down every decision I would make to make sure that the child was at the centre of it.  Far too often in education we pare down decisions we make -  there are geographical considerations, ethos and many interest groups -  but far too often children are not at the centre of those decisions.  That is why I am pleased that the vast majority of presentations today had children fundamentally at the centre of what we are trying to achieve.  I was particularly taken by Mr. Malone's presentation.  He works in this field.  The issue of admissions comes to the head where demand exceeds supply.  A  minority of schools will use their admission policies to keep their schools as mono-cultural and middle class as possible.   There will be school A, school B, and school C and in my constituency school C tends to get all the Traveller children, all the immigrant children and all the children with special needs and the other schools will utilise their admission policy and their ethos to ensure that they stay as mono-cultural and middle class as possible because they are all in competition with each other and they all need the numbers to keep the school going.  Such inter-school rivalry and inter-school competition is another problem in our education system.   In terms of the 25% limit, I completely agree with our guests.  With regard to the idea that a son or grandson or a daughter or granddaughter would have priority admission over somebody else, what is proposed in the Bill in this respect is an improvement but it is not perfect and I do not believe anybody would suggest that it is.  The 25% limit is an improvement but I do not believe it is necessary.  If one's father did not go to secondary school or if one comes from another part of the country or from another country, how can one compete for a place in a secondary school on that basis?  I am striving, as I believe other people are, for a society and a republic where children go to school together and nothing else is important.  We have not got our head around that yet and everything else seems to be more important.  Mr. McCabe has raised a very important aspect which we have not considered properly up to now.  It is incumbent on all of us to take what he has said on board and to work on it and make sure it is reflected in the Bill because he is talking about the most vulnerable children, provision for whom needs to be reflected in legislation.  I thank our guests for their presentations.  The spirit of what we are trying to achieve is acknowledged but the nuts and bolts of it will be more difficult to achieve.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I declare an interest in this matter because I was formerly a primary school principal, and may become one again very soon.  I am speaking with a certain level of knowledge, therefore.  In regard to the issue of school leadership, when people go into the profession of teaching the idea of becoming a principal probably does not enter their minds.  Is this something that should be dealt with at the teacher training stage, perhaps by way of a module, induction or conversation about school leadership?  School teaching is a very isolating job and sometimes it is tempting not to look outside one's classroom and students.  Should a sense of school leadership that could possibly be transformed into a consideration of the wider school community and the role of principals be encouraged at an early stage?  Many teachers become principals by accident.  They may never have thought the day would come when the staffroom would ask them to take over.  People step up to the role partly out of a sense of duty and often reluctantly because there is no boundary to a principal's responsibility.  The biggest difference between my current job and my previous one is that I am no longer expected to fix the photocopier.  As a principal, I had to fix the photocopier and everything else.  There was no point at which I could say "that is somebody else's responsibility."  That is a stressful position and it prevents principals from focusing on their primary role as a leader for learning.  They are dealing with everything else, from paperwork to departmental requirements, and sometimes things get dropped.  Do the witnesses agree there is a big difference, in terms of resources, between the principal of a school with 100 pupils and a school with 600 pupils?  How best can we manage that difference?  The stresses are similar but they have to be balanced with a reasonable expectation of resources.  In regard to Senator Power's point about the various reports that have not been implemented, perhaps Mr. Byrne and the departmental officials could comment on the issues arising.  It is wonderfully empowering to be a leader in any sphere but we must acknowledge at an early stage that the job of principal is very different to that of a teacher.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was in one of the first cohorts to do the junior certificate in 1992 and I got an A in honours Irish.  It was the only A I ever got, so I thought I would throw it out there as my biggest achievement in life.  To echo what has been said already, people always state they want change and reform, but when it comes, they can be uncomfortable with it.  I very much welcome the changes.  The main concern is coming from those we hope to empower to implement this change, who are the teachers.  Their main question mark is over the balance between being adjudicators and advocates for their students and how this balance might be shifted.  I accept the point that we ask teachers to assess their own students in first year, second year and fifth year, and now we hope to do it in third year and we do not want 15 year olds to go into the workplace.  How do we strike the balance between advocacy and assessment?  I assume that over the course of time we want to change the leaving certificate.  A problem at junior certificate is that 54,000 students do history at junior certificate level but only 11,000 do it at leaving certificate level whereas 54,000 students do honours geography at junior certificate level and 23,000 do it at leaving certificate level.  There is a problem with students not continuing with certain subjects to leaving certificate.  Is there a learning curve in this implementation as to how we might address the problem of the leaving certificate in the long term?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I apologise for being late.  I also thank the delegates for their presentations.  I met representatives of Friends of the Earth recently and felt that it was important that they come before the joint committee.  Energy accounts for approximately 30% of costs in schools.  Is that right?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it a noble aspiration that in time we move to a situation where, as happens in Northern Ireland, all schoolbooks will be free?  If that is a noble aspiration and something to which we should be moving, how will we achieve and fund it?  I ask the Department and the INTO for their views on this.  I ask the question in the light of the fact that we are moving towards a more digitised education sphere.  It is a noble aspiration towards which we should be working.  This entire conversation is taking place in the wider context of back to school costs and the costs incurred by schools which are transferred to parents.  On energy costs, there are over 4,000 school buildings, many of which are not as populated as they used to be.  Leadership is required from players in the education system to find a way to reduce energy costs.  We are funding, heating and lighting a lot of schools, some of which should be amalgamated.  It is difficult to justify the existence of some schools, but that is a very difficult conversation to have in many parts of rural and urban Ireland.  I ask the INTO and the Department for their views on the issue.  Last year the committee completed a report on back to school costs and one of the recommendations included in it was from the parents councils - primary and post-primary - that a financial committee be part of the structure of schools, separate from the board of management.  Such a committee would examine in detail the way money was being spent.  Parents are involved in fund-raising and often contribute directly to schools, but they do not know where their money goes.  If there was proper auditing or scrutiny of on what money was being spent, it might foster better energy awareness of the need to close windows, turn off radiators, lights, sockets and so forth when not needed.  Do the Department and the INTO have a view on the recommendation that schools have a financial committee, either as a sub-committee of the board of management or separate from it, to enable proper scrutiny of how funds are spent in schools?  If a school genuinely cannot pay its bills, despite being careful with money, the finger could point, reasonably, at the Department.  Is it reasonable to suggest having a financial committee might enable schools to find solutions to some of their problems?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chair and the Department, IBEC and ICTU for the presentations.  Many of the points I wanted to make have been raised so I will not go back over them.  Gender balance is an issue and ICTU raised the matter of boys underachieving.  What can the Department do to address the problem?  Is it possible to broaden the range of apprenticeships and what kind of apprenticeships would have most benefit?  It was suggested that a portion of employees' PRSI could be ring-fenced to fund apprenticeships.  The Department hates new ideas with regard to ring-fencing though it does not mind maintaining old systems of ring-fencing when it suits.  Perhaps Dr. Rigney can expand on this and the comparison with the previous scheme of employers' PRSI.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their presentations. I hope to speak on a number of issues, some of which are areas of agreement while others are potentially areas of disagreement. I will start with areas of agreement. I was impressed with the Minister's presentation on the issues of literacy and apprenticeships. Statistics on the levels of education among prisoners, for example, are disturbing. Two studies in recent years showed that half of our prisoners have a junior certificate qualification or lower. The Minister spoke about the high rate of functional illiteracy in Ireland which is one in six, meaning that around 18% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate. That level represents an improvement in recent years but it is still disturbingly high. The Minister spoke about members of the Traveller community and people with disabilities. I work with the Professional Football Association of Ireland, PFAI, which has told me that one third of League of Ireland footballers have only a junior certificate as their highest qualification. I ask the Minister to work with the Opposition on the issues of literacy and apprenticeships. Is there potential for us to work together on the establishment of a national literacy agency, as suggested by the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA? This would bring together all of the components, which are in eight or nine Government Departments, and put them into one single agency that could drive the issue of literacy across the board, including child, adult and family literacy. Two Private Members' Bills were introduced in the previous Dáil, one from the Government and the other from the Opposition, to provide for plain language in public documents to make them much more accessible. Often those who need public documents most are in the cohort of people with lower literacy levels. I ask the Minister and Minister of State to comment on those points first.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister’s comments there. On the leaving certificate, I am glad the Minister acknowledged that not everybody in the Opposition or across society was advocating for the scrapping of the written leaving certificate examinations because the Labour Party was not. We are advocating for independent investigation into what happened this year in order that it cannot be repeated next year. Rather than that being a point of contention between us, will the Minister speak on next year’s cohort and what they may go through if there is an issue regarding the sitting of a written leaving certificate examination next year? There are 60,000 students in sixth year this year who are worried about the potential for a repeat next year. Can the Minister give some level of comfort to them that lessons have been learned from this summer that will not be repeated next summer if it comes to the point where the same decision has to be made? We all hope it does not come to that point but some level of reassurance from the Government that lessons have been learned from this summer would be welcome because sixth year students are watching this very carefully.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will there be a recommendation going to all higher education institutions that they should move online this semester? Second, a cohort of students is moving into student accommodation because they have attendance requirements for their courses and do not have sufficient broadband at home. Will the Minister give some guidance or give us some comfort that he will be giving guidance to higher level institutions that there will be understanding in that regard and that attendance requirements being online or in person will be relaxed? This will mean students will not have to make decisions that will be extremely costly because of the quality of the broadband they have at home, their inability to have remote access to lectures and the cost of accommodation. We hope the Minister will work with the third level institutions to iron these issues out. There has to be some accommodation for what they are going through.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The witnesses mentioned Finland. I am always interested when people mention that country, which is very different from Ireland. It has a different education system, fundamentally underpinned by the radical idea of equality. It does not have the multitude of patrons that we have here. When the relevant legislation was introduced in 2013, it was considered slightly controversial because we were asking schools with a religious ethos to put in place anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic policies which, it could be suggested, were not in keeping with their ethos. Is there evidence of the nature of bullying changing from school to school here? In Ireland, we disproportionately separate children and decide that difference is important. Approximately 17% of children attend single-gender schools. One third of Irish second level schools are single gender. I have already mentioned the religious dimension.We separate children on the basis of income. Many other European countries are like that. Are there different dynamics of bullying in different types of school and is the way to address it different? Is addressing bullying now different to how it was 20 years ago because of the nature of social media? I know the witnesses will say yes. Would the witnesses agree that it can be difficult for a school to tackle bullying regardless of resources because it does not stay in the school? There used to be a time when a child went home from school where the bullying took place and back into his or her family's embrace, and had to endure or worry about it the next year. Now it follows the child via a mobile phone, smartphone or other connectivity that young people have. It is not necessarily something that they can switch off, or it is more difficult to. The next question that I have is about what bullying actually means. Some parents do not understand the nature of bullying and what it means. A fight, scrap or name-calling can happen in a school but that is not bullying. Bullying is a repeated action over a period of time. It is about power. Sometimes many interactions between a school authority or parent body are about incidents which are called bullying but are not bullying. I know Senator O'Loughlin had to go but I am interested in what she said about the person who is the bully or is called the bully, how that person identifies and views himself or herself and how our policies can get that person to change his or her behaviour. I know we have this no-blame approach that has been used in certain circumstances and in certain schools. Parents do not like it because they want a perpetrator and a victim. If their child has been victimised, they will then say that that person has done it, but if one stands back from it, both children are victims. One child is trying to act out something that he or she feels gives him or her power in a dysfunctional, destructive way and that needs to be analysed and corrected, because that child is feeling hurt as much as the child who is on the receiving end of it. I know I am asking a lot of questions but I will give the witnesses time to respond. Parents are a significant part of the answer. What strategies do the witnesses feel have worked? Children do not live in schools. Regardless of whether there was or was not connectivity with online devices, parents have to accept that children live in a community and a family, so school is only one element of their lives and cannot solve all their problems. Parents also need to realise that confrontational, humiliating behaviour, if it has come into our culture, which I believe it has more than in the past, will be identified, copied and repeated by children in their own lives and interactions. Parents have a powerful role in finding solutions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the witnesses. It is no secret the Labour Party did not support the cancellation of the exams when the announcement was made on 8 May. We felt the written exams should have gone ahead. I will go through the timeline. On 8 May, the announcement was made and there was a school profiling element for the calculated grades. The delay to leaving certificate results was announced on 17 July and the school profiling element was dropped on 1 September. Was there not a suggestion in that process that the school profiling element should have been dropped from the entire process much earlier to allow the system to adapt? Was it as a result of what happened in the UK that there was a feeling that the Irish system should change? We saw what happened in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. The results came out and the discrepancy seemed to see disadvantaged students being doubly disadvantaged. Was that a big influence on the decision? I will ask all my questions at once. Today, the Welsh education minister announced there will be no exams in Wales in 2021 and I am interested to know that if this is repeated across England, Northern Ireland and Scotland whether the Department of Education will also be minded to follow suit because of that rationale. Junior certificate results were used as part of the mechanism for determining leaving certificate results. How does it make sense to use those results if 2017 - the junior cycle cohort in question - was the first year of the new English cycle? It is also the case that 13% of students do not sit an Irish exam. These are two of the three core subjects within the mechanism as chosen by the Department and they already have question marks over them. I have a few questions on the process for choosing Polymetrika, and the witnesses have gone through that. It was indicated that the preference of the Department and stakeholders was to hold the June examinations in 2020 for a number of reasons. There was mention of the National Public Health Emergency Team and the political element, and these contributed to the final decision. The decision on school profiling was announced on 1 September but was the decision made much earlier? Was it felt that 1 September was the first time the Department could go public on that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That was in mid-August.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is very welcome. I wish to raise a few issues. I will speed through them and give the Minister as much time as possible to respond. In my interactions with schools and school principals I find there is a certain exhaustion in the system. The Minister will appreciate that they are working very hard to keep going and keep the schools open. There is an argument for a long Christmas break, perhaps ending school on December 18. I would like to get the reaction to that. I know that a huge amount of work would have to be done on childcare and consultation with education partners. Is the Minister minded to consider an elongated Christmas break, with schools closed for an extra two days over Christmas? On the topic of SNAs, I would like to ask about the 72-hour requirement. There is a controversial suggestion that SNAs will have to fulfil their requirement for 72 non-contact hours on-site. That is quite questionable practice during a pandemic. Does the Minister have a view on that? I know a letter was sent from the Department to principals last week. Considering the nature of the pandemic it would be strange if SNAs were asked to spend more time on-site than absolutely necessary.Last week, the Minister said the issue pertaining to the DEIS pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, would be addressed imminently, and she used that phrase again today. Will she move to a situation where any reduction in the PTR would automatically transfer to DEIS schools and that it would not have to come through a separate process?  I would like to get a sense of the expansion of the free books scheme which, in fairness, the Minister has rolled out. There was an announcement that there was potential for 50 schools to benefit and the Minister has doubled that to 102. That is extremely welcome, and something that we support. Is there ambition for a further free book scheme where, after a time, we might mirror what happens in Northern Ireland?  The expansion of second level places in expanding areas is a constituency issue for me. There are caps in newly established second level schools in what I might broadly call the Dublin 13 area, which has had a huge expansion of population and where there is potentially 15,000 of a new population in the area. There is a cap in place on newly established second level schools. Can that be investigated so that second level schools, whether newly established or existing, can expand their places because it is becoming a big pinch point and a problem in the system? 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is fair enough.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I thank them and their members for keeping our schools open. Without the schools being open, our country cannot function. I would like the witnesses to bring a message back to the members they represent of the gratitude of this committee and the people of Ireland. I have a question for Mr. Boyle before I ask for other responses. Mr. Boyle said he had not met with the Minster in quite some time, even though he has met representatives of NPHET and the Department weekly. When was the last time Mr. Boyle met the Minister?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is once since the schools reopened?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will make some general comments and ask for general reflections. With regard to public health teams and the HSE giving contradictory advice to different schools regarding close contacts, Fórsa has made its comments known about face coverings and PPE. Do the teacher unions have similar concerns? Will Mr. Boyle speak to the DEIS situation in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio, which has not been carried on to the infant or vertical DEIS schools? Will Mr. Pike speak to the issue of the 72 non-contact hours, which SNAs are required to do and on the issue of having SNAs on site during a pandemic? How wise or unwise does Mr. Pike feel that may be? What are the big lessons, from each of the witness's perspective, for post-Covid education in Ireland? What can we learn from this crisis? We did not learn enough from the last one, but what can we learn from this one in order that we can really repair education and make it fit for the people who work in it and for the people who learn in it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their attendance and their statements, which were interesting. I thank them also for keeping our schools open. The effort to keep schools open is shared among boards of management, school principals, teachers, special needs assistants, school secretaries, school caretakers, school wardens, and, obviously, the parent body and student body. Without their co-operation and their rowing in, it would not work. I have a few questions. I will ask Mr. Murray to start. The issue of over-assessment has been raised by a colleague of mine, Senator Wall. A number of sixth year students have said that in the absence of a clear statement from Government, teachers are in a position where they need back-up material to assess their students on, in the event of an assessed grade for 2021, which, to be honest, none of us wants to see. I was one of those who believed we should have gone ahead with the written exam in 2020, rather than going down the assessed grade route. What type of language would Mr. Murray like to hear from the Department? What type of statement would he like to hear from the Minister and the Department in relation to the certainty he or teachers need to ensure this over-assessment can stop? My second question, and I ask this of the National Parents Council Post-Primary as well, is on what type of acknowledgement the leaving certificate class of 2021 should get, considering there was a break in March, April and May of 2020. What would the witnesses like to see from the Department in acknowledging that break in tuition when assessing the leaving certificate class of 2021? Those questions are for Mr. Murray and Ms Fanning.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Mr. Murray is looking for clear guidance from the Department, such as a circular or something to stating it is aware that over-assessment could be taking place for sixth year students and clear guidelines. I appreciate the Department will be reluctant to categorically state there will be a written exam. We understand that is a difficult thing to say in any given year but that is the type of reassurance Mr. Murray would like.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What acknowledgement does Mr. Murray believe the Department should give for those lost months?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will spend my remaining time asking Ms Lynch about the lessons that can be learned from this. Initially when the crisis hit, there was much speculation around whether parents would have to start fundraising for personal protective equipment, PPE, where schools would get resources for what they would need to have and on the question of the underfunding of education. Ms Lynch has spoken eloquently in the past about how the relationship that parents have with schools is too often a financial one. It restricts the capacity of parents to go to the school gate or to a parent-teacher meeting if they are constantly being asked about money. Parents associations are often fundraising committees, or they feel like they are. Does Ms Lynch feel we can come out of this crisis with a better relationship between parents and schools that is not based on fundraising and finance?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«She thinks we should, though.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the National Parents Council Primary being asked by parents about fundraising for PPE?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I assume so because my time is up.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«She might have a comment on the financial relationship as well.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses who are very welcome. I will start on the literacy issue because it has been a feature of the presentations the Minister, Deputy Harris, has made to committee. He has also made public comments on the need to tackle the issue of adult literacy. I would like to hear the perspectives of our witnesses on how effectively we can do that. As has been said, 17.9% of the adult population is functionally illiterate. How can educators be agents of change in that regard? I am interested in Ms Hanney's comment on how one-to-one teaching is going to be much more advantageous in that. There will be issues overcoming Covid related restrictions in that respect.  On the issue of how Covid has affected the ability of the ETBs to deliver their services, the digital divide was mentioned. I have spoken to a number of second level principals, who spoke about the lack of knowledge on the part of policymakers of the digital divide. It is not about access to broadband; it is about access to devices that can be utilised. A principal told me that 60% of her student body could only access the work through their smartphones.  I have some more general questions. What have we learned from this period? As is often said, a good crisis should not be wasted. I worry that we will move beyond this crisis, feel that we have survived this period and look to the future, hoping that things will go back to exactly where they were previously. We all have a responsibility to learn from the deficiencies that have been exposed by this health crisis. Lessons were learned from the financial crisis a number of years ago, and structures were put in place. I hope the same will happen across education. The issue of funding has been mentioned by the witnesses and I take those comments on board. Do they believe there is something deeper, more profound and more structural that the education system can react to in learning from what Covid has exposed? If so, what would that be? We are all collectively trying to empower everybody in this country to maximise their capabilities, and the services provided by the organisations represented here today are key to that. I have a profound worry that, as with the financial crash, there is a feeling that things would be great if we could only get back to the good times. However, for many people working in education and society, and for those I have mentioned with lower literacy levels, things were not so great before. What can we learn from this experience to ensure that if we ever face this issue again, we will be in a much better position to survive it, and so that the education sector can thrive?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish I had 45 minutes, not just four. We should look into the idea of producing a committee report on the issue of trauma, particularly in primary and secondary schools. I thank Dr. Downes for his presentation. I do not know where to start. Does he accept that we cannot solve educational disadvantage within the school structure and that there is a large number of issues that happen before children ever get to school? We are familiar with the issue raised in the Hart and Risley study and the fact that if we take two three-year-olds from different backgrounds, as I often cite, with one three-year-old from a disadvantaged background and another three-year-old from a more mainstream background, there is a difference in their oral language capacity. Significant investment has to happen before a child ever gets to primary or secondary school. I refer also to the way that we structure the system, in particular, at second level, where it is not a State system but a State-funded system. We, therefore, have all this competition between schools, which means that there are schools that parents are trying to get their children into, there is a kind of layering underneath that and at the bottom there tends to be a school that has a disproportionate number of Traveller children, migrant children, children with special needs and children who have been suspended or expelled from other schools.It is not fair, but that is the system we have constructed. It is not a State system, but a competition system, and perhaps Dr. Downes would like to comment on that aspect.  Could he also speak about trauma and the issue of addiction? Having worked in that area, I know that addiction, especially with substance abuse, involves people trying to deal with pain. We do not like talking about pain and trauma in Irish society, because it is often felt to be an issue of failure. People, however, are suffering pain and walking around with pain that has been there a long time. It can also be intergenerational pain, which has been handed down to people. Those are some of my initial thoughts that I wanted to set out for Dr. Downes. I referred to the preschool element, that children do not live in schools and the question of how we can bridge the gap between what happens in schools and activity in the wider community. I also spoke about how structural inequality is built into the system, and we are always going to struggle with this issue until we crack that aspect. I finished by referring to the need to make the link between trauma and addiction and having a proper conversation on that connection.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegates for their presentations.I am sure I speak for everybody on the committee when I say that the political day can be quite long. In my own case, I will be here until 11 p.m. or midnight. This presentation will be the highlight of my day. I mean that sincerely. We are now looking at the education system in a different way because of Covid. It has exposed many things that do not work. One of a few things that gets me extremely wound up is the annual league tables. Having taught in school myself, as many people here have, it is no reflection of what success is. Success for some students is being in school every day. Success in some cases is being able to interact with somebody, to speak and to raise one's chin when addressing somebody else, to listen and be respected, and to show that respect to somebody else. That is why I am critical of it. In this committee, we might have the opportunity to form a new education system. If Ms Cotter was given the opportunity to start again, with all the money and opportunity in the world, what would she do with it? Mr. O'Leary is thinking about it and it might be a lot to throw at him. Is there an international comparison to the school that he has in Europe or the OECD or another comparable education system, into which the Cork Life Centre would fit neatly? The joke about the Irish education system is how many people in the Department of Education it takes to change a lightbulb, and they will answer by asking "Change?" As in, it does not change things, it has received things this way and they will always be thus. How has this system worked in other jurisdictions? How would Ms Cotter like to see things change if she had a blank sheet?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a big question.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am. I can confirm that my captors are treating me very well here in Leinster House. I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I will keep my comments as brief as possible. Professor Cunnane mentioned a very inspirational discussion on funding, the Cassells report, etc. I was hoping that others will also get an opportunity to touch on that. What has been learned from Covid in the sector? What has it exposed? There is a temptation for people to say "When we get back to normal" but for many people and many sectors, normal was the problem. Could the delegates speak to what normal was the problem in their sector, what can be learned from it and how we can make sure we do not waste a good crisis? I am aware that the delegation has already touched on the engagement on equality and ensuring the existence of a student body that is representative of Irish society, including new communities, disadvantaged communities and the Traveller community? Could the witnesses speak to that? Could they refer to gender equality, which is also important? Could they speak about funding, what has been learned from the pandemic, the normal to which we do not want to return, and the issue of inclusivity?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and Minister of State for being here. We had good presentations from various TUs throughout the country. They spoke repeatedly about funding, which is a legacy issue. Every time the Minister crosses my path at this committee, we talk about literacy because all political parties in the Oireachtas have an interest in this issue. The Minister mentioned a new national literacy, numeracy and digital strategy that will come out at Easter. I spoke to him previously about the number of Departments that have sections that deal with literacy. I think the number might be nine. This needs to be challenged with regard to how effective we can be as a political entity and an Oireachtas in tackling literacy issues if it is so dispersed. There is a section in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and another in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. If we were to create a single entity and call it Literacy Ireland to do what the Minister and all of us want to achieve, that might be something he could consider. Perhaps he could speak about that in the time he has. Will the Minister give the committee some reassurance that he is engaging proactively with the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, regarding the leaving certificate and post leaving certificate, the race for and plan for places, and how we can have a transition between this very troubling time for young people who are facing into the leaving certificate and the leaving certificate applied and the next stage in their lives, be it apprenticeships or further or third level education?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn um thráthnóna. Tá mé in ann a chinntiú go bhfuil mé i dTeach Laighin. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for some of the recent announcements of measures that we have been calling for and they have now delivered. We had a long discussion about passing the pupil-teacher ratio reduction on to DEIS schools. That was announced. We asked that the Minister waive the leaving certificate fee. That has been done. We asked that school profiling not form part of this year's calculated grading system. The Minister has ensured that. We also asked that she provide guidance for second level schools in advance of their return in order to deal with the issue of mock examinations. That has been done as well. It is only fair to put on the record the Minister's delivery of measures that were called for. The students returning to school have lost out on in-class teaching. It is important to emphasise the phrase "in-class teaching", given that teaching has been ongoing, albeit remotely, which has its own difficulties. Will the Minister speak about the Department's analysis of the effects of this loss on children? What scientific research has the Department undertaken to ascertain what damage has been done to children by not having in-class learning? As a result of that analysis, what supports does the Department believe need to be put in place? I do not necessarily want to talk about a feeling the Department has. Rather, I want to hear about actual analysis that has been undertaken.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Research has been undertaken and there is an acknowledgement within the Department that damage was done to children through unavoidable school closures. In the UK, there is a £1 billion catch-up fund for children and young people. Is it the Minister's intention to advocate for a fund that would do some of the work to help children who have been damaged - I use that word, but another term would be "negatively affected" - by the lack of in-class teaching to catch up? Can we expect a catch-up fund from the Department to finance the repair of the damage that has been indicated by its reviews?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a lack of school places in north Dublin for students transitioning from primary to second level. Is the Department aware of this issue? Is it taking moves to address it? We receive a number of queries in our office about this issue every year. This year the problem is particularly acute. I do not know if it is Covid related, but there is certainly a scarcity of places in second level across north Dublin and I wonder if the Minister could respond to that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The witnesses are all very welcome. My main question is on access to school places. I was horrified to learn what families are expected to do in order to access a place for their child if their child has an autism diagnosis. The process seems to be that a special education needs organiser will hand the parent a list of schools and wish them the best of luck. The parent will go to as many schools as he or she can in order to access the school place, whether primary or secondary. I know of parents who have gone to 15, 16 or 17 schools. I represent a constituency on the north side of Dublin and the lists of schools given to parents include schools in Drogheda. Parents may also access home tuition. I do not know any of us who is qualified to employ a tutor, whether during a pandemic or otherwise, who could adequately fulfil the needs of home tuition but this is what we are expecting people to do. Not only are parents dealing with a challenging situation of a diagnosis but they must almost go to war with the system to access a school place. There seems to be no absolute right to a school place. I spoke to a woman in my constituency yesterday who was in tears over the situation. She sent me a message to say her son has autism and there is no secondary school place for him until next year. He needs a special school placement as he has moderate autism, non-verbal skills, to be taught life skills, etc. She has been applying to special schools for the past four years with no success. He meets the enrolment criteria for the school's catchment area but because his needs require more help, a class space with compatible peers cannot be found. I know the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act changed the position and the Minister now has more powers to intervene in certain schools to meet the type of need that has been described at this meeting. How can the Department stand over a system in which a SENO hands a list of schools to a parent and abrogates responsibility? 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is in theory but in practice, it is something very different. Many parents just give up. The person I spoke to yesterday, whose case I have outlined today, has been seeking a secondary school placement for her child for four years. Ms McGrath mentioned pinch points. My constituency may be a pinch point, but there does not seem to be a policy determination from the Department that there is an absolute right to a school place and the SENO has to find that school place. It is up to the parent.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With respect, that is not the experience of parents with whom I deal. The experience of parents I deal with is that they talk to the SENO, who gives them a list of schools. Parents then interact with the schools which have all the expertise, language and education vocabulary. Parents are absolutely at a disadvantage. Schools can find many reasons why they cannot facilitate the child and the parent goes from school to school. The SENO can be a cheerleader for all that the SENO wants to be but fundamentally, there is no absolute right to a school place for the child that the SENO has to facilitate. It is up to the parents and the parents are, effectively, on their own.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I genuinely am not satisfied by that answer. We must have a fundamental overview and review of how the system interacts with parents who are completely exhausted by going to war, not just on this issue of school placements but on other issues of intervention and long waiting lists for assessment and intervention. When they finally try to get their child through the school gate, it can be hugely difficult for them.How the SENO interacts with this whole process is a massive failing. I do not know whether it is a constitutional overhang which makes the Department so reluctant to intervene in schools; it says the management of schools because it just does not want to intervene. A huge number of families are falling through the cracks because of an inability of the Department to properly defend the child. Defending the parents' right to choose whatever school they want to which to send their child lets the schools off the hook. While the SENO may be a support, it is not working. I wish the Department would accept that. A re-analysis of the way the system is supposed to operate is genuinely a necessity in this case because the person I am speaking of, who has been waiting four years for a secondary school place, is the tip of the iceberg. These are only the people who contact their local representatives. Many of them just give up. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I greatly appreciate it. I thank the Chair.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I confirm I am in Leinster House. We always learn more from these interactions which makes them so worthwhile. Even concerning some of the language used, I have learned so much from the contributors with whom I have had interactions in the past. The kind of language used, such as the "D" in ASD unit standing for disorder, needs to be challenged. We speak about training for teachers. It is not just about teachers but entire school communities. Society needs to up its game in order to have a fully functioning Republic which actually treats everybody with the proper level of dignity in the space in which they interact with the State. I am concerned about us having the same debate in 20 years' time, over and back. Is there something fundamentally wrong with the education system that it needs a constitutional referendum? We have created a system which is not a State system, but a State-funded system. It places all the power with patron bodies and boards of management with which a Minister could only interact recently. Fundamentally, that is where the power is. We are always going to be just tinkering with it unless we fundamentally overhaul the ethic and belief system around the education system. We cannot take a foreign model of special education and introduce it in Ireland because it will not fit. It is designed not to fit. People running around the place and trying to go outside their communities in order to go to school and chasing down resources is madness. Other jurisdictions, in particular the Nordic countries, would think it was crazy that people could not just access these services as a right in a State-funded school system. We do not have a State system. We have a State-funded system. A fantastic opportunity is being afforded to the Government in terms of a constitutional convention-citizens’ assembly on education. Are these the big questions we need to start asking? It should not just be questions about money here or there, or a unit here or there, or a change in legislation here or there. Are we going to have this row in perpetuity unless we radically overhaul what the education system does and what it is there for? The child is not at the centre of the education system. It is between what the patron body wants, what a teachers' union wants, what a political party wants and what a programme for Government says. Rarely is the child at the centre of this discussion.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Anyone who wants to dodge it should be allowed to dodge it. Anyone who wants to take it should be allowed to take it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I saw Dr. Muldoon indicate and I would be interested to hear his perspective.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome everybody. I can confirm that I am in Leinster House. Many issues have been touched on already and I want to give the witnesses a platform to expand on some of the points they want to make because due to the limited time available, committee members can speak for longer than the witnesses. I want to focus on youth unemployment, an issue I raised with the Tánaiste in the Dáil last Thursday. The figure given was 59%, which has been challenged. Whatever the percentage is - it may not be 59% because of the nature of the pandemic - it is still high. The EU average is 17%. The UK figure is 14%. Our figure, while not the highest, is still remarkably high. As I often say, the economic model offered to young people before now involved a lot of insecure and low paid work. Some 23% of Irish workers are in low paid jobs. How can we tackle youth unemployment and ensure that we do not return to an economic model which is dependent on insecure, low-paid employment? That is for anybody to respond to.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the guests. I am happy for any of them to take the questions. My first point concerns the general issue of bullying in society, which children are aware of. I suspect that bullying is very different now from how it was 20 or 30 years ago because, from my observations, it has become mainstream and features in media, game shows, reality TV shows and politics as well. I sometimes think we have to bully-proof our political campaigning because children see what is happening in wider society and impersonate what they see on screen and what is deemed to be acceptable. Furthermore, bullying nowadays does not just happen in school. It can follow people home because as long as they have a smartphone and other people have access to the phone number, they can be bullied at all hours of the day and night. There was a time when people could escape from it, at least until Monday, when they went home to the bosom of their family. Now it can happen all weekend long, through the night and the early hours of the morning. Schools will say they have an anti-bullying policy, but at what point does the school's responsibility finish? Obviously, bullying occurs not just within the student body; it can happen within the staff body as well, and children see this and are aware of it. Perhaps Dr. Muldoon or another of our guests will comment on that dynamic of not being able to escape bullying and of the wider societal responsibilities that politics or the media has. My third question relates to the understanding of bullying. In my experience, parents will sometimes suggest that their child is being bullied because of a once-off incident. Much time can then be spent on trying to explain to the parent the nature of bullying, which is not a once-off incident. Bullying is the persistent intimidation or reduction of one person by another over a prolonged period. The very definition of bullying can sometimes be misunderstood, and it is difficult to tackle something such as bullying if there is such a misunderstanding of its nature.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Dr. Noctor indicated a wish to comment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank all the contributors for their excellent presentations. This is an important topic. We discussed it last week also. I made several points last week on the change in the nature of bullying. It now follows the victim all around the place because of the advent of social media and smartphones. Often, there can be confusion over the definition of bullying, which involves repeated action over a period, not just a once-off event. I have a question for anybody who wants to take it on. I was interested in all the presentations made but was wondering whether the Irish education system is particularly ill-equipped to deal with bullying considering that it is based on separating children. We separate children at a much greater rate than most other European countries. We do so on the basis of religion, gender and income. Some 90% of our primary schools are under the patronage of a body that believes women are second-class citizens and that LGBT people are disordered. We do not have a State education system; we have a State-funded education system. Therefore, the reach of the Department goes only so far in respect of asking schools and patron bodies to implement anti-bullying or other policies. Is there evidence that any particular type of school or age group has a worse bullying problem? Is it a teenage issue? Does it start at infant level? Is the physical element of bullying worse now than five or ten years ago? I am interested in knowing that. I am also interested in coping mechanisms. Given that many of us were bullied as children – I certainly was – how do we ensure that we can instil coping mechanisms in children and young people? How can we ensure parents know what bullying is? A lot of parent-teacher time can be spent discussing what constitutes bullying. Sometimes it is believed that any kind of interaction or confrontation is bullying when often that is not the case. How can we focus on the repeated action, which is quite diminishing and absolutely humiliating for children and young people, and which lasts a lifetime? It is not just a phase. Bullying stays with most people for their entire lives. I would appreciate the comments of anybody who wishes to contribute on that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious of my time. Ms Brady wanted to comment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is a massive problem.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is a very strong point.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I confirm I am in Leinster House. I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I am slightly taken aback by some of the adversarial comments by some Government representatives towards the trade unions in particular, particularly given they are all on the front line and doing their best to deal with the issue of bullying. Bullying can start in school but, obviously, it moves away from school by the nature of it. As a result of the advent of smartphones, you can never really hide from it. In years gone by, you could go back to the bosom of your family and worry about it on Monday but now smartphones give the ability for bullies to be at you, intimidate you, hurt you and harm you at all hours of the day and night. I am also taken aback by comments about the nature of the RSE programme. A total of 90% of primary schools are under the patronage of a church that believes women are second-class citizens and LGBT people are disordered. As regards the patronage issue, we only managed to amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act a few years ago. I was involved in that. If a teacher is gay, divorced or a single parent, he or she is kind of under that ethos and is disadvantaged in trying to advocate for a more equal society and to point out homophobic or transphobic bullying or bullying that others people.I refer back to something said here last week by Saoirse Brady, the legal officer for the Children's Rights Alliance. She said one challenge we have is the lack of data and that schools sometimes struggle to ascertain proper data so that we can have a proper overview of when bullying starts, how much of it is racially motivated, how much is homophobic, or gender oriented? I mentioned the age profile. We do not know how violent it is, is it about exclusion, violence or is it about taunting? That question was for everyone.  Does Mr. Ryan believe the promised Government citizens' assembly on education is an appropriate avenue for us to deal with the totality of education, how our system is structured, how the patronage model works and how within that we can have a system where the Department plays an active role in the day-to-day management of schools? Under our current system a huge amount of responsibility is left by the Department of Education to boards of management and patron bodies and therefore it dilutes the capacity of the elected representative or the constituted Department to have more of an influence than the patron bodies do.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I confirm that I am in Leinster House. I have three quick questions: two for all three witnesses and one for Mr. Mulconry. My first question is on potentially restricting the age at which a child can own a smartphone. I do not know if it is possible or if it is necessarily desirable. Do any of the witnesses have a view on that? The nature of bullying has changed. It follows the child home and the witnesses have all mentioned online bullying. The first issue is accessibility through a smartphone. Do the witnesses have a view as to whether the disproportionately high level of gender segregation in Irish schools helps or hinders tackling this issue? Some 17% of all primary school children go to a single gender school. One third of secondary level young people go to a single gender school. Do the witnesses think this has an impact? In the terms of homophobic and transphobic bullying, the Catholic Church considers homosexual acts to be acts of grave depravity and that homosexuals are intrinsically disordered. How does Mr. Mulconry find the challenge of that stated belief system of the Catholic Church? Given that the Catholic Church is the patron of 90% of Irish primary schools, how can he balance that belief system with tackling homophobic bullying?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the contributors. I confirm I am in Leinster House. As I have said, we have been having these meetings for quite a number of weeks now, and every week we get increasingly impressive contributions. I am always advised not to say it, but I was a school principal for a time. The point Senator O'Reilly made is a most important one. As we all know, bullying comes from a place of deep unhappiness. Most of the conflicts I dealt with with children, whether in the case of bullying or negative interactions, would have been with children who were hungry. Before getting into who had done what, if I asked them a very simple question, namely, whether they had had their breakfast that morning, more often than not they would not have had their breakfast. They would not have had anything to eat since whatever time on the previous night. It may have been 12 hours since they had eaten something. Therefore, a teacher is always aware of issues as basic as food, the comfort of the child in the classroom and whatever is going on at home. If the child is comfortable in his or her own skin and is feeling secure, he or she is less likely to lash out. Having said that, bullying does not come exclusively from a place of poverty. There are any number of middle-class children who also engage in it. I ask the witnesses the following in turn. In respect of the online space, is it the witnesses' view that bullying has moved online or that it is an extra layer on top of what they are already dealing with? Previous contributors to this committee have stated there is a lack of data and that schools need to provide more data as to the nature of bullying, for example, in respect of the age, gender and ethnicity profiles. Would the witnesses agree with that? How can we deal with that? I also ask the witnesses to speak to the need for a specific racism policy in schools and more guidance from the Department. Some schools have policies and procedures that are outdated. The witnesses have spoken about waiting lists of 12 to 18 months for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. The more things change, the more they stay the same. With those questions in mind, I would appreciate the responses of the witnesses.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to ask a follow-up question. Are we doing enough to encourage teachers within the profession from ethnic minority backgrounds as role models within education? Is there more we could do?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That needs to be addressed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have heard it said in schools that during anti-bullying week bullying is off the charts because the focus is on it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Mr. Irwin for his strong contributions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I confirm that I am in Leinster House and thank the witnesses for their presentations. Following on from Deputy Ó Laoghaire's questions about data, I am not utterly convinced that those two fora for collecting the data are going to help us in the long term. The whole-school evaluation only happens every five or six years as I understand it. It is not a regular interaction with schools and, as Ms Keating has described it, it is a mechanism for evaluating policies and procedures. What has been suggested to us by contributors at other meetings is that we do not have data on the age at which bullying starts, whether there is a gender or aggression dynamic, whether physical bullying is more prevalent than isolation-type bullying, whether there is a racial or sexual orientation element or whether it is more prevalent at second level than at primary level. It is not just about how schools are dealing with bullying but also what it is. We need to collect data to find out what bullying in our schools looks like. I ask Ms Keating to speak to that aspect of data collection, as opposed to trying to find out how schools are dealing with bullying by way of their policies and procedures.  My second question is one that was asked previously at this committee. I am interested in the under-representation of minority groups among the teaching body. We do not have a teaching body that is representative of the student body.How can we find the mechanism to tackle that and ensure we do not have a homogenous teaching profession? I raise that because it is much easier to tackle issues of sexual orientation or racial diversity in the student body if we have a staff body which is reflective of that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Can I ask a quick follow-up question? I do apologise. Am I right in saying that there is no requirement on schools to detail the nature of each bullying incident, whether it was racially motivated or whether it involved a seven-year-old, a 12-year-old or a four-year-old? None of that is a requirement of schools, as I understand it
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I commend the Minister and Minister of State. I was curious as to how the Department would work. Both the Minister and the Minister of State have made this new Department work.I hope that this Department is a feature of public policy into the future because it would be very difficult to have this type of conversation in the old Department that had everything under its remit, with one senior Minister. The Minister has been very strong over the course of the year on all of the issues that have been touched on today. I congratulate him on that. If third level is to open up in September, as the Minister intends, it would be wonderful for all of those young people, and the students who are not so young. For many of us, attending third level education or colleges of further education was life forming. It was not necessarily just about what we learned in the lecture halls or tutor rooms. Mixing with other people from other backgrounds and other parts of the country and the world formed our identities. I congratulate the Minister on that plan. The committee will have to meet again to consider the Cassells report. We must also talk about literacy, an issue on which the Minister is very committed. Another issue I wish to raise is how we get role model professions that are under the Minister's remit to be more reflective of the society they serve. I have spoken to the Teaching Council and the Irish National Teachers Organisation on the issue. Let us consider, for example, the role of teaching. At primary level especially the teaching profession does not reflect the children in the classroom. We need to have proactive methodologies to encourage more working class children, children from a disadvantaged background, children with disabilities, children with an international background and children from a Traveller background into role model professions such as teaching. The CAO system is just not going to do it. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. Other role model professions can also be powerful in that regard. Notwithstanding the optimism around what will happen in this country in September, what is happening in the UK has worried everybody. We are not in control of that. Ireland's response to the Covid crisis was always contingent on what was happening next door. The Minister and Minister of State may not be able to repeat what I say, but what is happening across the water appears to be very ill-disciplined and reports are not encouraging with regard to the level of infection and the potential for new variants. If this happens over the course of the summer in the UK, and given that we have opened up to a certain degree here, I suggest we will still be talking about our envisaged opening up in August. Notwithstanding the well-placed optimism, I believe we need to be mindful of these factors. My next question for the Minister is about next year's leaving certificate, which impacts significantly on the Department. Would it be a good course of action for the Department and the Department of Education to take time to engage with the educational partners at this point? If they were to roll out leaving certificate 2022 as they rolled out leaving certificate 2021, we would not be worrying about the leaving certificate in the coming spring arising from the potential loss of in-class teaching. This student cohort has already lost a large amount of in-school teaching. Could a quick decision be made on this issue to prepare for all of the knock-on effects for the third level sector, which falls under the Minister's remit? I touched on a few issues and I am not expecting a full response on the Cassells report and all the issues I have raised. Considering what is happening in the UK and given that the situation is unpredictable, the big issue is that it would make everybody's life easier if we made a decision as quickly as possible on the leaving certificate for 2022, as we did on leaving certificate 2021.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am a bit taken aback by the attitude of Government speakers in particular. If any of the principals who have been in contact with are watching these deliberations, they will be pulling their hair out. Frankly, the return to school was a positive for many schools but there were individual school principals who had never contacted local representatives before in their lives but were forced to do so because of what they termed the shambles that they were dealing with earlier this month. I concede that not much of the responsibility fell at the doors of the Minister or the Minister of State. What happened was due to inaction on the part of the HSE and the inability of the public health teams to make timely interventions with schools. However, there were principals in contact with me who had no option other than to send home entire classes because three, four or five days passed without them hearing from the public health team. One school of which I am aware has 24 classes and only three CO2 monitors. In addition, we did not get the situation on pregnant teachers sorted in time. We have the catch-up scheme which has been described as completely inadequate by Judith Harford and Brian Fleming in The Irish Times. The scheme does not compare in any way favourably with similar schemes throughout Europe. To return to what has been said previously about literacy camps, I have been contacted by two DEIS schools which indicated that are still waiting to be paid. This sort of nothing-to-see-here attitude from Government is going to have to be checked because this level of complacency is part of the problem. I would suggest that none of us in Opposition parties have ramped up anxiety or tried to play to a gallery in trying to make people feel as though schools are unsafe. We have been trying to do the right thing. I would also suggest however that if the Government is not hearing what we are hearing, then maybe it is not listening as we are. We can only reflect back what is being said to us. I take this opportunity to ask again about the interaction between the Department and NPHET. Regulations relating to pregnant teachers changed. Regardless of whether that was completely coincidental because the matter was in the public arena or not, they did change. I would be interested in the Minister's reaction particularly to the situation relating to CO2 monitors and to the time gap which is leading principals being placed in completely impossible situations in some circumstances whereby they can nothing other than deal with problems relating to Covid and individual Covid cases. When is the citizens' assembly on education going to be established? We speak of anti-bullying, but we still have a situation where 90% of our schools are under the patronage of an institution that thinks homosexual acts are acts of grave depravity. Yet, we are supposed to be serious about tackling homophobic and transgender bullying in schools. I would think that the citizens' assembly on education should tackle that issue. I also wish to ask about the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill. Almost 12 months have elapsed since I brought an amendment to the House in order to delete the ridiculous provision within that Bill, which was put in at the behest of the private fee-paying school sector, to give schools the opportunity to have 25% of their enrolments set aside for children and grandchildren of past pupils. The Minister said at the time of the introduction of my amendment to delete that provision, that she would come back within 12 months. Those 12 months will be up in the first week of November. What work has been done on that? As I have the Minister's attention, there is a second level Gaelscoil in my constituency - Gaelcholáiste Reachrann - that really needs her urgent attention. I have written to the Minister and the Taoiseach about this matter and I raised the matter with the Tánaiste last week. I believe the Minister is familiar with the school, which is Donaghmede, Dublin 13. It absolutely needs urgent attention from her and her Department. Will the Minister address, in the short time I have allowed her, the position in schools? Could we get the literacy camps paid for? Does the Minister know when the citizens' assembly on education will be established? What is the story on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am also here in case the Chair missed me.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No, I am not in Leinster House.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Well spotted. I am in the car. Fair play to the Chair.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman very much. Like last week, Chairman, I can confirm that I am in Leinster House.I thank all of our witnesses very much for their presentations which I found very interesting. I will make a number of points and perhaps our witnesses can respond to them.  On teacher training, we do not have a very diverse teaching profession. I do not know how many teachers we have from ethnic backgrounds, from disadvantaged areas, or from the Traveller community but teaching is one of these professions which is ground-breaking and life-changing. The role model of being a teacher in a classroom is particularly powerful. I am wondering, and I have spoken to many different agencies about this, including the Teaching Council, as to how we can facilitate a mechanism of getting more teachers from diverse backgrounds into the teaching profession. I suggest that we should be as imaginative as possible.  If one is a primary school teacher, the Irish language is a particular requirement and that is completely understandable and justifiable. It would probably make more sense, however, to have the ability to teach Irish as something that one would train for in training college rather than being the pre-eminent barrier or requirement in order to become a primary school teacher. If one is not Irish or comes from an area that does not provide higher-level Irish in one's secondary school, that is an issue and it is therefore a barrier. I spent some time as a substitute teacher in a particular second level school in a disadvantaged area and higher-level Irish was not offered.How can those children become primary school teachers? It is therefore a barrier. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act was referred to earlier. Next month, we will have a review of the provision in the Act allowing schools to reserve 25% of places for the children or grandchildren of past pupils. I assume all the witnesses consider that provision to be regressive and unequal, and needs to be removed. I agree with what has been said on educational funding. Far too many conversations take place in education about money. It dominates many relationships. Parents associations are basically asked to be fundraising committees. Parents here are asked to pay for books, which they are not asked to do in Northern Ireland. I take issue with voluntary contributions. Schools believe they have to ask for them because if they do not, they cannot put the lights on. We need to move to a situation in which parents, teachers and principals do not feel compelled to have conversations around money all the time. Students certainly should not be asked for money. What are the views of the witnesses, particularly those representing the second level unions, on the banning of voluntary contributions? On the leaving certificate, do we not all believe that if we do not grab this opportunity now, it will not come up again? It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change this system. I do not know about anyone else's experience, but I am haunted by the leaving certificate I did in 1994, and I am 45 years of age. Sometimes the sentiment of people in Ireland is that they went through it, so there. In many of today's presentations, we heard that the leaving certificate is trusted, transparent and so on but it is damaging many young people. Some 85% of young people who go to disadvantaged schools make it to the leaving certificate and 15% do not. It is in no way reflective of the person. It is a brutal, savage system that puts far too much pressure on young people.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Can we sort out the sound issues because some of the important points have been lost? Do we think they have been sorted out?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Chair is happy for me to proceed. Do I have time to continue with the rest of the witnesses?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask the witnesses to respond to my questions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious of the time and I know Mr. Jones and Mr. Gillespie want to respond.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will we ask Mr. Jones to proceed?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Chairman might advise if my allotted time is up.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank our guests for their contributions. I found them particularly exciting, if I can use that word, because I feel there is an historic opportunity for us to grasp reform of the leaving certificate and do something with it. I do not think anybody who has been through it or who has a family member going through it or who is in the system can pretend it should stay as it is. Even the term "leaving certificate" is a complete misnomer because I do not think anybody genuinely expects that the majority of students will use it as an entry into the workforce. It does not provide an entry into the workforce. It is an entrance examination for the next academic phase for most students.We have a particularly unequal education system, which is especially pronounced at second level. Second-level schools compete against each other. Social mobility means there is a push to get into what is perceived to be, in any given community, a more academic school, which can sometimes be fee-paying and sometimes not. As a result, there is a stepping-stone effect with the most desirable or second-most desirable schools and, at the end of that entire ladder, there is always a school in any given community that has a disproportionate number of migrant and Traveller children in addition to children with special educational needs. We allow those schools to exist because we want to allow social mobility, and choice and competition between second-level schools, to continue. It is the patronage model and we are stuck with it unless we decide to have a referendum on it.  The point is it is already very unequal. As has been said, people can game the system to try to buy results by getting grinds. Certain second-level schools cannot even offer higher-level subjects because they cannot justify the resources. Those subjects include higher-level maths and Irish so how can someone be a primary school teacher if he or she goes to that school? He or she cannot. It is already particularly unequal. Some 85% of students who attend disadvantaged second-level schools do the leaving certificate. The average percentage of students, overall, who do it, is approximately 91% so 15% of disadvantaged students do not make it to the leaving certificate at all.  We also have the issue of piled-on pressure at the end of sixth year, which does not indicate anybody's ability in anything. It might make someone good at training to be a politician, where he or she does all his or her work at the end of five years and pretends he or she has been working very hard all the way through. Most of us do. Anyway, it is all piled in at the end to prove your worth. It is not surprising many young people do not make it through. It is also not surprising that the lesson they have learned and the training they have received in the second-level system does not in any way equip them for the future.  My main focus is on getting the witnesses' reflections on what I have said about the inequalities within the system. Does the system in any way equip young people to be the best of themselves, to think independently, to trust their own judgments and opinions and to have the self-confidence to go to the next stage of their lives? Is it just a hole they have to fill to get to the next point? I would be interested in comments on that. It is not directed at anybody in particular. I am just interested in the witnesses' reflections.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have a general point to make. Professor Hegarty referred to the reform of the junior certificate. From my memory, that was not an easy process to go through at the time, although it was not suggested that people go into the workforce with only a junior certificate. The timing and way in which that programme was reformed meant it was a difficult process. That experience probably put the political system off reforming the leaving certificate. That said, I appeal to the people involved in this process to ask themselves what the point of this is. If we were to put the student at the heart of this process, we would construct an entirely different system, but we always seem to have every other agency or interest group pulling and dragging at the system. If middle Ireland likes something because it has been through it and it has been successful for it, then middle Ireland will want to defend it. However, we are not here for middle Ireland; we are here for every young person in the system.I do not think any young person going through it, regardless of their background, feels that it reflects them. Even if they have a successful process through it, most young people are still terrified by it. Why we have scared young people in our second level schools is something we should all reflect on. I thank the witnesses for their contributions. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Assess.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The witnesses are welcome. I appreciate their presentations. I think it is the view of the committee that this is our one chance in a generation to reform the leaving certificate when we come out of this pandemic. The examination has remained largely unchanged from the time we were all traumatised by it, back in the day when we sat it. We have to address a number of things, but two in particular. The first is what school is like for the young people or children going through it. Are they studying things they are interested in? The second is how those things are assessed. You could have a great experience in school studying and learning things you are interested in, but the model of assessing what you know is brutal. Alternatively, you could have a situation where you are not that interested because what you are being asked to learn does not reflect who you are, where you are from, your background, heritage and culture or the interests of those in the locality you are from. You are asked to study things that are alien to you and then to go through an assessment process that is brutal and that does not reflect your abilities and how you learn. Some 15% of students who go to DEIS second level schools do not make it as far as leaving certificate. We have a reasonably high level of retention until leaving certificate year. I think it is approximately 91%, which reflects pretty well internationally, but it is 85% in DEIS schools. I have a few statistics. The number of DEIS schools where not a single student studies higher level English at leaving certificate level is 31. There are 39 DEIS schools where not a single student does higher level Maths and 41 where not a single student does higher level Irish. In terms of higher level Irish, that is 41 second level schools where not a single student can become a primary school teacher. That is either because not everybody is good at Irish or because the school has determined that it cannot justify the resources for somebody who may be good at Irish. This happened during the debate on assessed grading for the leaving certificate when members of this committee were strongly against the idea of school profiling. What if a student is one of the small number who have the ability and who want to power through and break through disadvantage and poverty? How will he or she do it when the entire context of what is happening at his or her school militates against it? We have a second level system based on competition. Schools compete against each other and have the whole reputation thing going on, so they have open days. I am supposed to direct questions to individuals but I like to direct questions to those who are interested in answering them rather than putting people on the spot. How do we assess those things? First, how do we produce a school experience that is reflective of young people and what they know and want to learn? Second, how do we produce a model that can assess that? Third, how have we come to a situation where schools are failing young people because of the competition model we have insisted upon? There are 41 schools in the Republic that cannot produce a primary teacher because not one single student either has access to or has been empowered enough to do higher level Irish.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Probably the strongest statement I heard today was from Mr. Hennessy in terms of giving the leaving certificate back to the students. Does Ms Ward want to comment?

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My time is up but I would be grateful if Mr. Hennessy could respond.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate my colleagues facilitating me. It is hard to know where to start every week because all of us feel quite strongly about this matter. As has been said, if the odds are stacked against the poorer students, one would feel like setting fire to the whole thing immediately. Who wants it to stay as it is? We cannot find anybody willing to come in front of the committee to tell us that this should remain absolutely unchanged, so I am trying to think who would such people be. The grinds schools want the system to remain absolutely as it is because there is money to be made. There are the schools that like to present themselves as being academically superior and high on school league tables. There is an appalling journalistic insistence on throwing out completely untested data on schools; even the Department of Education does not like it and will not produce it under freedom of information. So who is the system benefiting? I am interested in what the witnesses said about teacher involvement and how it is more usual across Europe. A number of years ago, we tried to change the junior certificate and there was massive resistance. There was the use of terms like "banning history". The leaving certificate does not just strangle young people; it also strangles subjects, as people who care about history might know. My understanding is 54,000 students every year do junior certificate geography and history, 23,000 do leaving certificate geography but only 11,000 do leaving certificate history. That is because students are afraid of the exam because it is a heavy and arduous written exam. How do we get from where we are to what we want to achieve? In all this, there is a scenario of certain schools not offering certain subjects at certain levels. I gave statistics last week indicating there are 31 schools in the Republic of Ireland where no student does higher-level Irish for the leaving certificate and 39 schools where no student does higher level maths. I may have my subjects mixed up but there are approximately 30 or 40 schools at second level where not a single student does honours or higher-level English, Irish or maths. The process is stacked against poorer students. With the assessed grades system over the past two years, we have learned that we can have proactive teacher involvement in assessment, with agreement. It was not perfect and it was done as a firefighting measure because of the pandemic but surely within it there is potential for changing our mindset. How do we learn from what has happened over the past two years and how do we make a difference now? The witnesses are absolutely right in saying there is an intergenerational attachment to the exam because anybody from middle Ireland who has successfully negotiated second and third level feel there is nothing wrong because it was fine for them. They want their children to be protected by the system that was successful for them. If people have not been successful through it, they will not have as strong a voice. How do we learn from the past two years and the matters raised by the assessed grades model, imperfect and all as it is? Is this our one opportunity? If we miss it, we may be another 20 or 30 years before we have this discussion again.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a basis for the beginning of a conversation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. Apologies, I have to leave after my contributions. So the witnesses will be aware, we have had a number of presentations over the past weeks.The committee in general feels that this is our one opportunity to do something about the leaving certificate and that if we do not do something now, we will have lost a historic opportunity. I have a sense that the education system in general perpetuates inequality and, therefore, the leaving certificate also perpetuates that inequality within the system. It prepares people to be good at doing the leaving certificate but does not necessarily prepare them for much else. People with means can buy results by stepping outside the system and facilitating their children to go to the Gaeltacht for Irish, access grinds for any other subject and so on. There is also a great disparity between what certain second level schools can offer. We saw that with Covid and the digital divide but also with DEIS second level schools. Some 85% of students make it to leaving certificate. We have a system that we feel needs to be radically overhauled but how do we do that? There are two issues. One is what the students are studying and the second is how we assess what they are studying. Is it fair to lump a load of written exams at the end of sixth year and expect that to be an adequate reflection of anybody's abilities? There is also all the commercial pressures that go in with that and the journalistic obsession with points and the ranking of schools. I have a question for the business representatives. I am trying to be as fair as I possibly can. Is there not a hard business case for the eradication of educational inequality? Does it not make sense for representatives from ISME and IBEC and others to have radical positions on the economic viability of the State for prosperity, that is, that inequalities within the system be got rid of and that we have a fully literate 18- or 19-year-old cohort leaving school? We would not have one third of children in disadvantaged schools coming out with basic reading problems, there would not be that level of drift from 16 years onwards in disadvantaged areas, and 17.9% of our adult population would not be functionally illiterate. People would not be falling through the cracks and, therefore, leading lives in which they do not contribute as much as they possibly could to their own happiness and well-being, as well as to wider society. Is there not a hard, cold, economic case to be made for the eradication of educational inequality? Do the witnesses not think their own presentations into the future could be more balanced? They could address both the needs of business but also what is needed for wider society. I sometimes think the presentations are a bit lopsided. For anyone else who wants to contribute, do they agree with my assessment that the leaving certificate basically makes people good at doing the leaving certificate? We need a model which, I have to be honest, will potentially involve teachers embracing the idea of self-assessment in the context of their students. That is something we got used to over the last two years as part of the Covid response to the leaving certificate and it could potentially be part of a future leaving certificate. Those are my questions. I ask the witnesses to address the business case for the eradication of educational inequality and how restrictive an assessment model this is for what students are studying.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to ask Dr. Freeman a direct question on access to STEM subjects in all-girl schools or within our highly gendered second level system. Approximately one third of our second level schools are single gender. Traditionally, access to STEM subjects has been a challenge among all-girl schools, which is changing but possibly not changing enough. Is that something Dr. Freeman agrees with? Is it still an issue? Does remote learning, which we have seen during the past three years, offer an opportunity to schools, which have not had such a traditional dynamic, to deliver certain subjects into the future? Could remote learning fill that gap?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«To follow on from the remarks of Deputy Ó Snodaigh and before I get into the discussion on the reform of the leaving certificate in the long term, there is a strong case to be made for an early decision on whether the leaving certificate for 2022 will be rolled out in the same format as the exam in 2021. The students who are undertaking next year's leaving certificate missed a significant amount of in-class learning when they were in fifth year and are going through a teacher substitution crisis at the moment. I understand from many second level schools that teachers are covering classes that are not theirs and a significant number of teachers are absent due to the pandemic, yet there still seem to be conversations about potentially closing early for Christmas and there is even a question mark over whether schools will open after Christmas in the context of the nature of the new variant. Although it might not be very popular, would it not be quicker, cleaner and easier for the Department to make an early decision to roll out the leaving certificate for 2022 in the same manner as was done in 2021, with a hybrid model involving written exams and accredited grades?All the students who lost out in fifth year and who are losing out now because of the substitution crisis, and who will potentially lose out in the new year, will have additional stress because of the ambiguity. I do not necessarily expect an answer or opinion on that, but perhaps I could be given an indication as to whether the disruption this year is ongoing. Others referred to correlations with their own school experience. How fundamentally has the leaving certificate changed since I did it in 1994? Subject changes and changes to certain assessment levels have been alluded to. Is the leaving certificate radically different from what it was in 1994, when I did it? I assume it is pretty much the same. With regard to subject choice, the remote learning that has come into play in the past couple of years has possibilities. I realise I am always banging this drum but there are schools that do not have the same subject choice as others. That is the way we run our system. We do not have a State system; we have a State-funded system. In certain schools, a value judgment is made as to whether one subject should be chosen over another. Alternatively, there may be timetabling issues meaning a student cannot do French and economics or another combination. A small number of schools do not offer education at higher level in English, Irish and mathematics, which disadvantages the students in attendance. With the advent of remote learning, is it the intention of the Department to consider the possibility of expanding subject choices through remote learning so the physical walls of a school will no longer have to be a boundary? We are not living in 1950s Ireland. If somebody wants to do higher level Irish and a teacher is not available in the school, surely we can facilitate him or her. If somebody wants to do higher level mathematics and a teacher is not available in the school, surely we can facilitate that. If somebody has a timetable clash whereby French and another subject cannot both be studied, surely remote learning could be a solution and the Department could drive that. The reform of the junior certificate process was quite tortuous and not really taken on board. There was a lot of misinformation. I am pretty scalded by it. I remember conversations about the reform of history. These were so misinformed that we were almost on the back foot before we started. I am referring to reasons given for banning history and history no longer being available, for example. It is my understanding there is a massive drop-off in the number of students who study history after junior certificate level. The number drops from something like 54,000 to 13,000, by comparison with that for geography, which drops from 54,000 to approximately 25,000. Am I right about the statistics? Are we still having a big problem with history? How do we feel that leaving certificate reform might advance the cause of subjects such as history? I could talk about the Irish language all day, but I will probably get another opportunity.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«How much time do I have?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In 50% of schools it already was a requirement at junior level anyway. There is a bit of a misconception about what is being proposed. I wish to return to another issue. If a student does not have leaving certificate higher level Irish, he or she cannot become a primary school teacher. If he or she goes to a school that does not offer higher leaving certificate Irish, he or she cannot become a primary school teacher, effectively. Unfortunately, that means that a number of schools will be disadvantaged. On the designation, I think the standard of Irish that graduates have when they leave teacher training college is more important than the standard of Irish they have when they enter teacher training college. There is not necessarily any evidence to suggest that having higher level Irish makes you a half decent Irish teacher at primary level. Does Mr. Moran think it is in the capacity of the Department to facilitate a student, who, for example, does not have access to higher level Irish in a particular school to be taught remotely, rather than the student having to physically move to a different place or somebody having to physically come to that school to teach them? I think what remote learning has shown us is that there is potential - notwithstanding digital development and all the rest of it - to shake up the subject choice and the subject level choice for students who, heretofore, may have been disadvantaged because of the nature or dynamic of their school and the pressures schools are under.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their engagement. I found it very interesting.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have no questions. I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their attendance. This is my legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am just grateful to the Houses of the Oireachtas for facilitating a Bill like this. It was chosen through the random-selection process as a Private Members' Bill on a Thursday evening and the Minister gave 12 months for it to be assessed, and here we are. It is a great credit to the Oireachtas that a Bill like this can get to this point. I will start with a point of agreement. All of us agree that it is better that children should access a local school and that no criteria should ever have to be needed to differentiate between children.However, if I were to ask any of the people here, whether the members, the witnesses or the secretariat, what school their fathers and mothers or grandfathers and grandmothers went to, they would probably feel that was an irrelevant question and would perhaps be slightly insulted by it because I might be perceived as trying to paint a picture of who there are. I understand that this provision in the legislation was included because of the lobbying by the fee-paying sector, which wanted to maintain some sort of royal line of succession within their school communities. It is up to them to undertake that lobbying and for them to answer as to why they wanted to do it. The argument that this approach is one that not many schools adopt does not stand up. To suggest, based on experience, that only about 15 schools are adhering to or enforcing this approach, then that is still 15 schools too many. For people living in the communities around those 15 schools, it is irrelevant to them if they are on the rough side of this discussion. Everyone should enter the school admissions process as equal citizens in this republic. It should not matter where someone’s father went to school or who he was. It is completely offensive to the equality agenda of a republic for consideration to be given to the school that someone’s father or mother went to, or, indeed, the school that someone’s grandfather or grandmother went to. It is absolutely offensive. How is anybody expected to compete for a place in those circumstances? I accept that we should not have a situation where young people are competing for places, but how are they supposed to compete for a place or try to access a place on an equal basis, if they are not from the area or the country or if their parents or grandparents did not attend secondary school? What if this were to be the only opportunity that someone’s family has ever had to break out of a cycle of educational disadvantage, attend secondary school and in that way break out of disadvantage? Yet a person in that situation could be disadvantaged in trying to enter that school because his or her father or grandfather did not go to it. It is so patently elitist and wrong that I cannot believe that anyone would try to defend it on any level whatsoever.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This provision was included in the legislation because of lobbying from a certain cohort that wanted it to be put under the radar. When the 2018 Act was passed, it was progressive legislation and most attention was paid to the abolition of the baptism barrier. We all felt it was progressive legislation, but I made these arguments in the Seanad when it went through. I was voted down and that is what happens. We are now in a position, however, where we are asking people to defend it. I cannot, for the life of me, understand how the best argument that people can come up with is that not many schools actually use this criterion now. Other schools could use it and all schools could use it, if they wanted to do so. Every school could say to child A versus child B that the father of child A went to the school. A great deal of inequality in Ireland is based on education. Nothing perpetuates inequality more than the Irish education system. Much of it comes down to what schools people have gone to, the advantages they have had, the area they have come from, etc. The committee will have to tackle the issue. To enshrine inequality in legislation, however, and to give more rights to those families who have had the advantage of attending secondary school, because their parents or grandparents did, is offensive to the idea of a republic. It is offensive to the idea of an education system that lifts everybody. Therefore, the argument that this type of approach does not really happen very often is a ridiculous one to my mind. I return to the situation of those children who need education more than anybody else. The possibility that such children would be asked even once in any process where their parents or grandparents went to school or that such a situation could arise in any circumstances in any school is something that should not be in any legislation and especially not in a proposed Bill on school admissions.Those are my views. I will be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy with the response. I would again like to point out that even if this only affects a small number of people, for them it is overwhelmingly significant. The defence is that this is not normally utilised within the school experience. If someone is on the rough end of this it does not matter how many schools across the country use it or not. The school that person wanted to attend did use it and the fact that his or her parent or grandparent did not attend the school was the reason he or she did not get in. That potentially has a life-forming impact. While we may say it is only a handful of schools, it could grow and grow. The fact it is there in legislation gives it legitimacy. There is legitimacy from the Houses of the Oireachtas to discriminate on the basis of what school someone's parents or grandparents went to. I know I might be using strong language here but I do find it offensive. There is a middle Ireland assumption that everybody's grandparents went to secondary school or that everybody's parents went to secondary school but not everybody's did, including those from outside the area or the country or from a tradition where their grandparents or parents were not afforded that opportunity. This goes to the core of what inequality really feels like. Middle Ireland needs to understand that. Those overseeing the management of our schools and our education system need to understand that too.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their contributions. It is heartwarming to hear the support for the Bill, which I drafted. What has been interesting this and last week is that this has opened up a wider discussion on the nature of Irish education and who it serves. It is beginning to become clear that, effectively, it serves the patron. What happens every year is that parents and children are at the heart of this scramble for what is perceived to be the better or best school in their area. It is depressing that we have come to assume there has to be such a suggestion that one school is better than another and that not every school could be of a similar standard and have similar outcomes and resources. I believe fundamentally that we need a Finnish revolution in Irish education. We have 4,000 schools in a country that has the same population as Manchester. We have schools competing against each other. When there is that level of competition it leads to inequality. This debate comes down to a scenario where some children are struggling to get into a school, and that should not be a reality. I think all members of this committee, regardless of our background, agree that we do not want a scenario in which children are turned away from a school, for whatever reason. If the State was front and centre in the provision of school places, there would be a school in each individual school district that could accommodate every child in the area, not the current multiplicity of schools that separate children on the basis of religion, gender and sometimes income. With that in mind, what we have been doing in the past two weeks, unbeknownst to ourselves almost, is having a wider conversation about school provision, the patronage model and the lack of involvement by the Department of Education. Within all that, I believe a certain sector that wants us to keep the generational bloodline of succession within its schools exercised a disproportionate influence over the Education (Admission to Schools) Act. As Deputy O'Callaghan said last week, the relevant section in the Act is completely contradictory because another section in the same Act states there should not be familial advantage for any particular family. Despite that, this provision, which does not read with the rest of the Bill, was wedged in at the behest of a certain strong lobby group. I agree with everything the witnesses have said. I do not have too many questions. The only defence for this provision last week was along the lines, "Ah sure, it is never really used." That is a pathetic excuse because even if one child in this Republic was on the rough end of this provision because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not attend the school, that knowledge would probably sit with that child for life. It would make that child feel for life that they were just was not the same because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not have the same opportunities.  It is funny because - my mother would probably kill me for saying this in public session but I will say it anyway - I am reluctant to ask in my own family whether all of my grandparents went to secondary school because I am pretty sure not all of them did. I am still reluctant to ask that question because there is a level of shame attached to that. Last week, Senator Eileen Flynn, who cannot be here today, gave very powerful testimony about how nobody in her family had been to secondary school - neither her father or grandfather - and how emotional she felt that this could potentially be a disadvantage to her. Education is so personal and emotive. It says everything, too much, about us. For those trying to break through poverty, education is their only chance. Family will provide help and support but for people who do not have education in their family background, education is their only chance of breaking through intergenerational poverty. That is why a provision such as this is so wrong and elitist. It goes against anything that education is supposed to achieve that because someone's father went to a certain school, that person has a better chance of attending it. For someone who is not from this country or from a particular area and does not come from a tradition of school attendance, having any of these factors as a reason for not being able to attend a certain school would, as I said, have a lifelong effect. It would also make that person feel that regardless of any genuine efforts to try to row in or to move into the mainstream, for example, by changing their accent or pretending to live somewhere else, changing the way they dress or cut their hair, they will never be let into the club because their father did not go to a certain school. I imagine that would make some young people pretty angry, even if that is only one person.  I saw some heads nodding when I brought up the contradiction within the Bill. Does anyone wish to speak to that? Apart from the emotional argument I made, there is also the legislative argument that it is legislative nonsense to have two provisions in the same Bill aspiring to two different things. I appreciate the witnesses' support for what the committee is collectively trying to do.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does anyone else have any other comments before I wrap up?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have nothing else to say about this. We will come back to the Finnish revolution another time.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. As the Chair said, I will have to leave the meeting after this. I am very impressed with the presentations.Many of the witnesses speak about access, those on the margins and disadvantage. We still have an issue in Ireland with functional literacy with 17.9% of our adult population functionally illiterate. It is something we regularly discuss here. I suppose the witnesses have all come here looking for money so we need to cut to the chase of what the discussion is really about. There are a couple of topics regularly bandied around in Irish political discourse. If it is said in any forum that crime is out of control, most people will nod their heads in agreement. If anybody rings "Liveline" and says "crime is out of control, Joe", most people would agree. It does not matter what kind of international statistics we have about crime in Ireland versus any other country in the world, people would still nod their head and say crime is out of control. If we say people in Ireland are overtaxed, most people would again nod their heads and say they are overtaxed. Again, not to disparage "Liveline" but the caller to that programme would say "we are overtaxed, Joe". In any pub conversation, political conversation or electoral cycle, people will assume we are overtaxed, despite it not being true. We need much more maturity in the Irish political discourse and we cannot pretend to invest more in public services, as the delegations are advocating, with zero cost. They have provided a very reasonable suggestion of a levy on the corporate sector here, raising €550 million. We made the political argument that to give away €500 million of tax cuts in the last budget, given the state of public finances, was not the right thing to do. I remember almost 30 years ago being a beneficiary of free education at third level and it opened doors for my family and other families like mine that could enter third level education. Maybe some doors would have been closed to us otherwise. Nevertheless, we lost the argument on the idea from the mid-1990s until recently. The suggestion was made that essentially this was an advantage from which only middle class people would benefit. The argument was that the funding mechanism should have been funnelled in a different way. There is no way of adequately funding public services and making them free and excellent, as happens right across Europe, without having a proper discussion about the way we tax and people invest so they can feel proud of their tax system. They should feel it is a duty and we should get away from the political discourse around every levy and taxation measure. There is a language around "tax burden" and "squeezed middle" that always seems to come into the political discourse. If I am going to nod my head and say the witnesses are absolutely right, as I want to, it would be dishonest of me to say they are right and we must absolutely fund what they want to achieve while telling people during my political campaigning that they are overtaxed. I do not believe they are. How do we fix that? How do we make that political argument and convince the people of Ireland that a fair, transparent and progressive taxation system does not need political buy-off or auctioneering around election time? Hard questions and choices must be made about how our taxation system produces highly educated and free citizenry. They are free to make choices and live their lives with an education that has lifted them. We cannot do that if we still get into the mire of comparing this tax to this levy and the assumption we are overtaxed. There is also an assumption that public services are not excellent, and that is part of the same right-wing, conservative discussion. As the witnesses are all seeking money, will they help me out?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a much more equitable suggestion than, for example, that of a student loan system. I believe this committee was unanimous against that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am quite sure we will be in conversation again.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. When officials from the Department of Education appeared before us a number of months ago, I asked them what the main difference was between the time I did the leaving certificate in 1994 and the leaving certificate now. The suggestion from the Department was that it was not different in any radical way. At its inception, the leaving certificate was a qualification with which one went into the world. Now, it is a qualification with which one goes on to the next stage of education. There is a different dynamic that goes with it now.Indeed, when we were trying to reform the junior certificate we had that same kind of view that young people do not go into the world with their junior certificates as they might have done with their intermediate certificates back in the day. This is the question I really have for the witnesses. We are trying to reform something that everybody or most people accept needs to be radically reformed. There is a level trust with the leaving certificate, however, and we must be careful about how we tinker with that. People feel that it is transparent; I would not use the word "fair". It is incredibly brutal. We have come to the stage now where people who do it successfully become good at doing leaving certificates. There is an industry built around it. We must be honest about that. There are grind schools and people who are willing to sell notes. There is a whole industry built around getting one's child or a young person through this system. Parents are able to buy or use those extra resources. There is, therefore, fundamentally an inequality at the heart of the leaving certificate. Not every school is the same and not every school can offer the same options. Not every school can offer higher level Irish, English and mathematics and basic core subjects such as those. How do we come to a scenario, therefore, where if we are going to assess people, we are assessing them fairly? How do we ensure that every student has the opportunity to study whatever subject he or she feels best fits his or her skill set and can study it at whatever level he or she feels they can? How unfair is it to have a second-level school that does not offer honours or higher level Irish thereby restricting that young person from ever being a primary school teacher, for example? Those schools exist. I remember once being a secondary school substitute teacher. I came across a young woman who was teaching herself higher level mathematics in a room by herself because there was no higher level maths teacher in the school. The level of determination that young woman went through to do and study that is unthinkable in a more middle-class advantaged scenario. This is my general point. What kind of discussion is going on as to how to level out that inequality to ensure that every student, no matter what school he or she goes to, can through remote learning or any other way avail of every single possibility or level of subjects he or she can? Yes, we may have a transparent leaving certificate but it does not have the brutality and inequality attached to it. I will touch on when Deputy Ó Laoghaire and I attended the teacher conferences. There was a sense of resistance to this idea of assessing one's own students from the conferences we attended. If we are going to reform then we must reform. I cannot pretend that the teacher unions have ever been friends of reform when it comes to examination structures in Ireland. I bear the wounds of the junior certificate reform process in that regard. We have to bring people with us whatever our opinions. They are my two main points. How do we make it fairer than just being transparent? How do we bring people with us?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and the Minister of State. We have all been very impressed with the Cork Life Centre, in particular. It has been in front of the committee and we have met the representatives on a number of occasions. I do not think there was one member of the committee who was not incredibly impressed by the service it provides. I met Mr. Don O' Leary yesterday and he was anxious that there would be some light at the end of tunnel in terms of what the centre is trying to do. The Minister, Deputy Foley' presentation speaks again of a review. Unfortunately, for people in the Cork Life Centre, that is not going to give them an awful lot of comfort. I am intrigued by the phrase "out-of-school provision" and not "alternative education". When dealing with the Department of Education, you always have to be very cognisant of the fact that it knows language very well. The Department knows language very well, so the choice of the phrase "out-of-school provision" is a deliberate one. It gives a connotation of something that is odd or unusual. It has negative connotations in terms of what the provision does, that is, it is out-of-school rather than being part of the educational provision by the State. Will the Minister speak specifically on the Cork Life Centre? What support will be provided to ensure those young people can continue? Can I ask specifically about this phrase "out-of-school provision" which the Department has chosen to use? Does the Minister agree that it does not really fit well with those who are working in alternative education? For those who attend services such as the Cork Life Centre, it is school and it is their educational experience. They are being provided with an alternative to what many people might consider the mainstream, but it is not "out-of-school". I have an issue with that phraseology.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I notice the Minister did not use the phrase "alternative education". I do not know if that was deliberate or not. Regarding the Cork Life Centre and the fears and concerns they have, is the Minister in a position to give them comfort as to their future?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State will join me and other members of the committee in thanking and congratulating school communities around the country. Those communities came out of the traumatic period of the pandemic and all the challenges that had to be overcome in that regard and are now embracing the new challenge of thousands of children without English as a first language falling into their care. Those children are suffering from all sorts of trauma as a result of what they have witnessed and where they have come from as they settle into a new environment. They have concerns about their family members at home. The teaching profession and those who work in schools, including SNAs, secretaries, caretakers and boards of management, have stepped up to welcome those thousands of students to their schools. We totally accept it was never going to be perfect. There were always going to be teething problems. However, there are a number of issues. It has come to my notice, for example, that in certain circumstances a child may be in a school for a number of weeks and with very short notice, the student and his or her family may be relocated to another part of the country. A number of families were going to schools in my constituency and with short notice were moved to Youghal. I understand these things have to happen and that in an emergency scenario not everything is going to be done perfectly. Will the Minister speak to how such situations are communicated and managed? How is a school informed of those sorts of situations? A particular young person in the neighbouring constituency of Fingal has special educational needs and is utilising the available resources in a school setting. The change of location for that young person is going to be even more challenging as they move from one setting to another. What communications are the different agencies having about the individual needs of children when they are being moved from one part of the country to another? What kind of communication takes place with the school and the education partners? Does special educational need come into that discussion? We previously thought that the child and the family may be moved elsewhere. Should we reconsider that? I hope my next point does not come across as unfair but I feel strongly about this issue, as the Minister will be aware. A Ukrainian child who is now trying to access a secondary school place will be disadvantaged by the fact that certain schools retain 25% of their intake for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. A Ukrainian is very unlikely to have a parent or grandparent who attended a secondary school in a locality in Ireland. Does that not again expose how unfair that provision is?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I hope that in the circumstances of the settling down period this person has had with the supports around them, it will be considered best not to move to a different part of the country because a break in the resource the child is getting is not ideal.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank all the witnesses for their presentations. I was reading their statements last night and this morning and it is worth noting the invaluable work they do all year round and the invaluable service they provide for children and for those on the margins. It should not be just in times of crisis that we acknowledge their work. The Ministers came before the committee two weeks ago, when we held two 45-minute sessions. I will make some comments with regard to what we raised with the Ministers. If any particular person wants to respond, that is fine. I do not want to put anybody on the spot. There were three main issues. One was the issue of displacement. Teething problems have come to my notice. Of course, there will be such problems in light of the number of Ukrainian refugees and families who have arrived in Ireland but we have seen situations in which children have settled into a school environment and the uniform has been bought. These children may have seen and heard very traumatic things, they may be worried about family members and, of course, they face the language issue. I am given to understand that they can then, with very little notice, be moved from point A to point B, with point B being in a very rural setting. I do not know if the witnesses wish to comment on how that is being managed and communicated to the education system. On a second issue, children with special educational needs may be more integrated or knitted into a school setting because their needs are being met in that school. Is the system too rigid to accommodate that? The Minister recognised what I was saying about that having an even bigger impact on a family but I was not convinced that there was sufficient fluidity in the system to allow for that level of education for such young people to be maintained, notwithstanding the difficulties with accommodation. Reference has been made to the last point I wish to make. A situation like this is going to expose some of the frailties and fault lines in provision for children. That is good. We should never waste a good crisis. If this exposes existing problems within the system as regards education provision and the supports we provide for children, we should rise to that challenge. However, it has been said and is demonstrably true that there is a dichotomy between what is now being afforded to Ukrainian children and what is being afforded to children already within the protection system. I agree with Mr. Henderson's point that it should not be the case that we treat Ukrainian children in the way children already in the system are being treated. If we can provide a greater level of language support for Ukrainian children, then all children should benefit from that higher level of support. I would not want it to be said of the Irish system that is has one attitude towards - let us be blunt - white Christians on the edge of Europe and another towards those who are not white Christians and not from the edge of Europe. That is an uncomfortable sentence to have to utter but if that is the underlying suspicion within the Irish education system and among practitioners, it is a very troubling one. I have experience of being a Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality and I must say that I did not come away feeling that the Department was fit to deal with this entire area. I was extremely welcoming of the move by the current Government to take a lot of this responsibility away from that Department and to give it to the new Department under the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. That was a very positive move showing a much more humane mindset.  Those are my points. I mentioned the continuum of education for all children, how it can be managed and the displacement element. I also mentioned children with special educational needs and how that issue needs to be properly recognised. My third point was on the exposure of the dichotomy or split in the system between what Ukrainian children and young people are being afforded with regard to language supports and what is being afforded to those already in the system. I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on that and on how it should be addressed. I am interested in what any of the witnesses have to say.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I believe it is relevant.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does the representative of Barnardos want to make reference to the displacement issue? Perhaps Mr. Henderson would like to make reference to his earlier comment on levelling up.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That was my experience. We can appreciate that moving to temporary accommodation to more permanent accommodation is preferable, but at issue is the overnight element.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The lack of information for schools was not great either. Does Mr. Henderson wish to respond further on the levelling up issue?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. I congratulate Fórsa and the individual SNAs who have brought this conversation to the heart of the Houses of the Oireachtas today. It shows the power of joining a union. The tag line or slogan the SNAs are using is "Respect for SNAs". In my work in this area over several years, the lack of respect has become clear to me. I wish to link this back to the basic requirements. In an individual school, for example, the teachers can often be called by their second names while the SNAs will be called by their first names. This is a clear message to everybody in the school regarding who is deserving of more respect. Everybody can see and hear that and the children, more effectively and profoundly, can see that. It does not happen in every school, but it is the case in many schools. It would be "Mr. Kehoe" or "Ms Dolan" and then "Bernie" or "Michael". This sends a strong message. SNAs have told me that the continuing professional development, CPD, available to teachers is not available to them. We have had the conversation around the allocation for next year only being released on 31 May. There are other issues in the system regarding July provision and the different rates of pay for doing the same job. On a day-to-day basis as well, SNAs are tasked with doing some pretty menial jobs in the classroom or school setting. Much of this is based, I believe, on the connection between the basic requirements to become an SNA and their status in the school and in the system. Therefore, this situation does not just depend on how a teacher or a school treats SNAs. It is about how the Department treats them. Would the Minister of State accept there is a link between the day-to-day disrespect some SNAs have experienced and this minimum requirement issue? To give the Minister of State time to answer my questions, my other query concerns whether she is in a position to say she wants to get the accreditation recognised and change the minimum requirements for SNAs, and that she will go through a process of a review. Is it her stated objective, as the Minister of State, to change these things? I ask this because there are two types of ministerial responses in my experience. One type of response from a Minister or Minister of State is passive and states there is a review and he or she will see what happens after that. The other type of response from a Minister or Minister of State, however, states the outcome he or she wants and, while he or she will listen to what the Department is saying, he or she fundamentally believes the accreditation needs to be recognised and the minimum requirements need to change. Those are my two questions. One was on the link between the minimum qualification requirements and the basic respect SNAs do or do not get. The second concerned the Minister of State's personal conviction in this area.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was explained to me that the Department still, in effect, views the SNA role as a scheme, rather than as something more permanent. Can the Minister of State speak to that? If it is the case, which I believe it is, that needs to be changed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They do.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As I said and has been repeated since, I congratulate Fórsa and the individual SNAs who have brought this conversation to heart of the Oireachtas and demanded responses from everybody in the Oireachtas, from every political party, from every political entity and from the Minister and the Minister of State as well. This is to their credit. The opening remarks placed great emphasis on the classification of the SNA role as being part of a scheme. I had previous conversations with Ms O’Sullivan in meetings about this issue. It is front and centre as part of the problem. While the Minister of State gave a level of comfort regarding the work that is ongoing to deal with the essential accreditation we spoke about and the basic requirements, I was a bit taken aback by her apparent surprise that the classification of the role as a scheme was problematic. She said that it was dealt with by circular, as if circulars cannot change, evolve or be reissued. Therefore, the emphasis the SNAs have placed on this scheme, when compared with the response from the Minister of State, is the biggest thing I took away from this session.  I ask Mr. Pike and Ms O’Sullivan to flesh out the issue concerning the scheme and its classification. Regarding my comments around the late date for the allocation of SNAs, namely, 31 May, the issue of CPD that teachers get but SNAs do not, July provision, the different rates of pay and the individual stories in schools, that we also know about, do all these issues lead back to the lack of certainty found in these roles and to the lack of respect for them? It is not difficult to ask a school to respect an SNA, but it is hypocritical of the Department to demand respect for SNAs if it is not respecting the people in these roles itself.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will one of the SNA witnesses comment on the scheme and the insecurity they have spoken about when it comes to mortgage repayments, rent payments and so on? How can they have security in their lives if the job is so insecure from year to year?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It just so happens that an Oireachtas football team is going into Mountjoy Prison today to play a match, so it is appropriate that the witnesses are here to discuss this topic. I remember reading an article by Neil Gaiman in The Guardian some years ago in which he wrote that the prison service in the US had been outsourced to private providers. When an attempt is made to assess what the capacity needs of the prison service will be in 15 years' time, the literacy rates of ten-year-olds are examined. There is a correlation between the literacy rates of ten-year-olds in any given jurisdiction and the need that will emerge 15 years later for prison places. The work the witnesses do is crucial. What happens in the Prison Service reflects wider society, and the witnesses are trying to grapple with that. As has been said, we have issues in respect of educational disadvantage that are not the fault of those in the Prison Service; its members are just trying to deal with them. Having such a number of people in the prison system with poor rates of educational attainment tells me two things. One is that some people have been forced down the road of crime by poverty. The other is that middle-class people who commit crimes do not end up in prison. It is important to say there is inequality there as well. I am interested in the literacy perspective and the comments on the need for in-cell tuition. In the Prison Service, there is obviously a need to balance the security needs of the prison with the digital needs of education. In wider society we have a functional illiteracy rate of about 17.9%, which means one in six adults is functionally illiterate. While people in that situation may be able to get through their day and hide their literacy levels, for example, by pretending they cannot see something because they forgot their glasses or whatever, when it comes to filling out forms or engaging properly in Irish society, people who are functionally illiterate will struggle. Equally, if the rate of functional illiteracy is 17.9% in wider society, I can only assume it is much higher among the prison population. Surely it is fundamental to identify what that level is to enable us to deal with these literacy and numeracy issues. Do the witnesses find that there is a need for more enjoyable hooks to act as a gateway to get people to address their numeracy and literacy needs? Learning to read is not fun. Addressing literacy deficiencies is not going to be fun. Art, for example, is going to be more enjoyable, as are activities such as sport and drama. On literacy rates, how can we get an assessment of what the needs are in this regard? It was mentioned that literacy permeates the curriculum. How far are we from in-cell tuition? People in prison are dealing with a level of trauma and humiliation, thinking about what is going to happen to them after their sentences have been served and wondering how society is going to view them. There may be a sense of pointlessness in this respect. People might think they are always going to be tarred with the taint of the time they spent inside prison. How is it possible to break through those types of barriers?  I suggest to the Chair that it might be a good use of members' time to visit a prison, with the required co-operation, and observe at first-hand what is being done there.Education is a great liberator. It changes lives. It is the only thing that has been proved to break people out of poverty. Surely at the most intense level of need is when the resources and the imagination of the State needs to be invested so that it can be the great liberator, not just at the walls of the prison but also about the walls of the mind as well. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Would it not be ideal if there was not that two-month gap in the year? Teachers are teachers, I understand that, but is there a way of being flexible and working around that? If somebody is getting into and enjoying something, beginning to enhance and empower themselves, that two-month break can be-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am pretty sure we are going to get hammered in this match today.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«So I believe. I thank the witnesses.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister and her officials. She is going to have to accept that this was grossly mishandled and an apology from her to those who have been affected would go a long way. She said apologies have been issued by Bus Éireann, but she has to take responsibility for how this has been handled. How much is the new initiative costing?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are dealing with an extra €40 million. I imagine that, when the Minister makes an announcement in July that is going to cost €40 million, she would do a little bit of homework and make sure that it works correctly. Bus Éireann management say that the first time they heard about an entirely free scheme was after the Cabinet decision. The Minister is suggesting that consultations were taking place beforehand. Bus Éireann says those were not in the context of an entirely free scheme and that it was about driving down the cost for individual parents and families. That is what Bus Éireann management are saying. What does the Minister say to that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In terms of an entirely free scheme?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is not what I am asking. My problem with the Minister's answers is that she does not answer the question I am asking her. There is a very important-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is not answering the question I am asking.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have only got a certain amount of time.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Okay. Were the discussions with Bus Éireann prior to the decision being made by Cabinet on the basis of an entirely free scheme?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I find myself unconvinced by the Minister's answer. I was unconvinced by her presentation last night as well, because Bus Éireann seemed to be slightly surprised by this announcement made in July. Be that as it may-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can only go by the evidence that is front of me and by the evidence that is given by Bus Éireann.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for that clarification. I will ask about the roll-out of the scheme. What type of intensive conversations took place in the month of August between the Minister, her officials, her Department and Bus Éireann to ensure that this €40 million scheme would be rolled out successfully?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know and many people are not.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«These are young people who have been on the bus for the previous three or four years and now because of the Minister's new €40 million scheme, which was not properly prepared, they are now on the side of the road. The Minister is not in a position to apologise to those families for what is clearly a failing by her Department.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No, I would prefer that the people who were previously-------
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No I would prefer-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister has asked me a question.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is in the interest of this committee-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What about those who were previously on the bus, who are now not on the bus?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will that be a comfort to them?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister and his officials. I join with the previous speaker in congratulating the Minister on the Department and its success. Some of us were unconvinced as to the necessity of a new Department but it has proven its worth. It is now a feature and a fixture and deserves to be. The Minister made a success of it and that needs to be acknowledged. We share many aspirations about free education, particularly in the area of literacy, which he has done great work on and I congratulate him on that. On the cross-Border piece, I want to focus on one issue today, if I might, which feeds into the cross-Border discussion. On teacher training, to put it delicately, there is an issue regarding the cohort of teachers we are training and the qualifications that necessitate their access to teacher training courses. Barriers to teacher training are placed in front of young people from certain backgrounds. They might be from disadvantaged or Traveller backgrounds or they could be from the North or overseas. Some of those barriers relate to the Irish language. This is a difficult one to verbalise because many people feel very strongly about the Irish language, as I do myself; I have a degree in Irish. I try to pronounce my name to people with great difficulty in every election. The serious point is that the requirement of the standard of Irish to enter training colleges needs to be challenged. What we need in teacher training is a diverse population of teachers in our primary schools that reflects the children they are teaching. It is still a very white, middle-class teaching profession. It does not reflect a new Ireland or any new Ireland we want to promote. The Irish language could also be seen as a barrier, particularly in terms of the North. Would it not work better, considering the new Ireland we hope to engage with, to have people from more disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have had higher level Irish as an option in their second level school? They certainly might not have had the chance to go to the Gaeltacht three summers in a row for financial reasons. Would it not be better to focus on their ability to learn and teach Irish when they are in training college, rather than as a requirement to get into training college? It is still such a powerful profession. If someone comes from a minority, be it ethnic or any other kind of minority, particularly disadvantaged children, and if he or she has somebody from his or her community as a learning and educational leader in the classroom, it is incredibly powerful. While it is not the only barrier, perhaps the Irish language requirement could be tweaked a little, not in any way to reduce the quality of Irish language teaching in the classroom, but to do it in a way that teachers are empowered to teach Irish better when they are in training college, rather than having that funnel exclude some people who may not have had the opportunity to learn Irish at second level. They could be students from the North or a disadvantaged background or abroad. How powerful would it be to have somebody who came here as an asylum seeker working as a primary school teacher? The one reason they probably cannot is the requirement to have Irish entering teacher training college. It is an issue I have tried to pursue for a long time. At one point, we had a number of students from DEIS second level schools in my constituency learning Irish and getting grinds in Marino Institute of Education. That was a solution. Some managed to achieve the required Irish language level and they became teachers. We were proud of that, but it is not a long-term fix. I wanted to bounce that off the Minister, to use this platform to raise it and see if he has any sense of how we could move on that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know. You need your mammy to row in as well though, as she helpfully did-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was trying to be nice.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank all of the speakers for coming. I will make some comments before Ms Foley expands on some of the issues she raised. Much of what she said has resonated with many of us here. The Irish education system is almost uniquely set up to have mental health challenges within it. We separate children on the basis of religion and income and we separate them more than any other European country seems to. From my own experience, I know that children are coming to the school gate hungry and possibly having not slept the previous night or witnessed things that they probably should not as children and then facing the scenario of an oversized class with a teacher trying to balance all the needs of those children. We have one of the largest class sizes in Europe. It is coming down however and that should be acknowledged. It is a reality in the classroom. The SNA, as Mr. Honer rightly said, is under-appreciated in the system and is struggling for respect. There is an absolutely traumatic change at the most vital time, as Ms Leydon rightly said, in their formative years when going from the primary school setting to secondary school, with a complete change in the ethos and the exam-driven atmosphere. You are trying to tackle issues like homophobia or transphobia in a school. You have to worry about what the patron body has to say about those matters because we have a disproportionate number of schools under religious patronage. Ms Foley made a point about the new junior certificate being a welcome development. The resistance to that change was something the Department had to grapple with. When we speak about leaving certificate change, I hear resistance to that and a determination to go back to where we were. Within all of that we must pay tribute to teachers, SNAs and those working in schools who do their absolute best to mind the mental health of the students in front of them. There are gaps between what the HSE provides and what the Department of Education provides. Often, children fall between those gaps. I would like to focus on one thing with Ms Foley, namely, exams at second level because many issues have been raised. There is a focus on exams. The teacher has 40 minutes to deliver the programme and there can be pressure from parents about what the teacher is doing and how the targets are being met. Everything seems to come down to the junior certificate results and then, of course, the leaving results and the pressures associated with that.Can Ms Foley expand on that and maybe feed into what we all hope, certainly from my point of view, will be a changed leaving certificate and a changed system at second level that allows the space for a young person to be themselves and not to fit into this very rigid old exam that suits some people? Of course, one knows that people that it suits tend to make the rules when they move on from second level but those who it does not suit do not tend to make the rules. Can Ms Foley expand on that and use the opportunity the committee presents to tell us from her organisation's perspective how she feels the exam system impacts on mental health and how it could be changed?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does Ms Foley find at second level that the exam pressure is there from day one until the day one leaves and that it is unreasonable?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am still traumatised by my leaving certificate history exam.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Ms Foley.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for the presentations. I feel, as I am sure my colleagues do, that the presentations have been overwhelming. It feels like we face a tsunami of mental health challenges across the country. The witnesses made strong points about the lack of psychologists, the lack of funding and the issues that young people are having. I will start on a positive note. Last week, I attended the Yellow Flag Programme awards, which were rolled out by the Irish Traveller Movement. A number of schools across the country have taken the initiative to go with that programme and speak about integration and anti-racism policies. They are seeing success. I was at a presentation from Scoil Chiaráin in Donnycarney last Thursday night. I think the programme is called "what he needs". There was a film that deals with toxic masculinity and how to respond to it positively in issues that young people come across. There are individual schools that are doing their best, notwithstanding the existing challenges. I have separated out some of the mental health challenges that young people can face. They can deal with issues outside school that are then brought into school. Individuals may be dealing with issues, such as health issues or sexual orientation issues. There may be school-based issues. I am always interested in the wider context. We often talk about funding and strategies, which is absolutely right. What if the way in which we set up the education system is exacerbating these problems? We expect 12- and 13-year-olds to transition to a new stage of their education at a point when they are becoming more self-aware. That can become a traumatic change. We have an exam-focused second level education system which has to be more stressful than other education systems across Europe. We are constantly talking about examination reform. We seem to be ill-equipped to challenge the patronage model of schools and how we separate children by gender, income and in other ways.I will focus these questions on Ms Murray and Mr. Power. What percentage of these issues are we dealing with which are caused by schools? What percentage of them are being brought into school from the outside? Do we have to have a conversation about how equipped or ill-equipped the entire system is for what we ask young people to go through to deal with their lives and the individual mental health stress they may have?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious that my time is running out and I wish to hear from Mr. Power, unless Ms Murray has another quick point to make.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations, which I found fascinating. We have had quite a number of presentations on this issue. I welcome the young people who are present to witness our deliberations because this issue obviously affects them too. We have heard quite a number of presentations from different agencies and actors over the past number of weeks. The feeling is that there is a tsunami of a mental health crisis across our school system and among our young people.I want to touch on a few points. I am taken by the model in Limerick. It sounds like it is excellent and it is working, but what depresses me is that it took such philanthropic funding to set it up. This can be the nature of things. I will make a few points that I often make. Our educational system is not built around children. It is built around what anybody else wants, but not what is best for children. It is built around what the actors who are inherent in the education system want, including teacher unions, patron bodies or the Department. We rarely hear directly from children or their parents. The system is deliberately set up like that, constitutionally, which is a problem. The State does not feel as if it has a de facto management role. It funds the system, but it does not feel like it manages it, necessarily. The system at second level is primarily exam focused, and when we try to reform that we are met with resistance. There was massive resistance to junior certificate reform, and we are currently being met with significant resistance to leaving certificate reform. When I look at the young people in the Gallery today, I wince at the thought of what I went through as a young person in secondary school. It has not changed in all that time. It is intensely stressful to go from what can be quite a compassionate environment at primary level to a very subject-orientated environment. It is not possible for students to build relationships with 40-minute classes. The change to that type of atmosphere at second level is a difficult one for young people to get their heads around. I want to speak to how we can reform that. I will make what might be regarded as a controversial point. On the introduction of a model at primary level that provides the wraparound services that have been discussed, the problem is that there are 3,300 primary schools in Ireland. There are a lot of schools. If we want to provide services that are going to properly assist those children, having 3,300 schools is the difficulty. A service cannot be provided in each and every one of those schools, so we have to find a mechanism that enables us to do it effectively. We need a critical mass in order to provide that service. Perhaps that is an unfair thing to say. I have a few questions for the witnesses. First, how can we manage our education system to ensure the primacy of the child's experience in the overall policy setting? Second, I ask the witnesses to comment on the over-emphasis on exams and exam pressure at second level. Third, if we do advocate, as we should, for this type of wraparound service that is freely available to young people, teachers and schools, how do we manage that in a system that has such a multiplicity of schools right across the country? There are 4,000 schools in total, 3,300 of which are at primary level. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I think Mr. Rolston wishes to comment on the examinations aspect.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like to add my view on what I believe is outrageous behaviour of the part of the insurance companies dealing with the residents in my constituency, whom I have been trying to support.  I find Mr. Kemp's comments in regard to the Tolka works puzzling.  In the most recent floods in 2008, 2009 and on 24 October last, the Tolka region was almost unaffected.  There must be a communication breakdown somewhere.  I would like to put on record the trauma being experienced by these people in terms of their dealings with the insurance companies.  As pointed out by the Chairman, Deputies Murphy and Humphreys and others, these people are living in homes that are effectively worthless because, as everyone knows, without house insurance one cannot sell a house.  While some families are obtaining a level of flood cover, new purchasers of houses in the area will not get cover.  Leaving aside the trauma of living in an area of perceived threat of flooding, which threat has in many cases subsided because of remedial works, having this situation hanging over their heads is a life sentence.  Despite that works are planned, have been signed off on or completed, the attitude of the insurance companies has not budged, which is outrageous.  I agree with the Chairman that the response in terms of the role of the federation in moving the insurance industry towards a situation whereby it can take individual cases outside the geocoding is disappointing.  A shift in culture and attitude is required.  It is difficult for any of us to offer support to residents in this situation when the attitude of the federation representatives is simply to throw their hands in the air and say they wished things were different but there is nothing much they can do.  We are all aware of the savage nature of market forces and what has happened to our economy.  The families concerned have been left once again to the mercy of the savage nature of market forces and are suffering as a consequence.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting us to attend. I will begin by showing members a short promotional video about Culture Ireland.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Culture Ireland was set up under the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2005 to promote Irish arts and artists worldwide. As Culture Ireland marks a decade in operation, it is timely to examine its performance and set clear goals for its future. Culture Ireland’s strategy is to provide support for the international presence of Irish artists and arts organisations, develop new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts and, in tandem with other relevant State agencies and as reflected in the expert advisory committee, link culture into the overall Government international promotional strategy. The expert advisory committee operates on a non-statutory basis and is comprised of representatives from the arts sector, the Irish Film Board, the Arts Council, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Generating career opportunities for Irish artists and raising the international profile and awareness of Ireland’s creativity is at the core of what Culture Ireland does. Further, there is a concerted effort to maximise the potential of culture as a leading motivator for tourism to Ireland and to utilise Ireland's cultural profile as a driver of trade and investment. During the past ten years, Culture Ireland has supported over 4,000 events across 100 countries involving Irish theatre makers, musicians, singers, writers, dancers, visual artists and film-makers, presenting their work to audiences around the world. Culture Ireland gives financial support to approximately 400 events annually through its regular grant rounds for support of global presentation across all art forms. To date in 2015, Culture Ireland has generated the equivalent of 151 full-time jobs for artists abroad. By the end of the year, this is expected to have risen to in excess of 250 full-time jobs from the annual investment of €2.5 million. It is important to stress that 95% of Culture Ireland's funding is given directly to Irish artists for their travel costs. This support generally leverages other support and sponsorship, with artists’ fees usually covered by income generated at the international venues' box office. Culture Ireland has delivered high-profile events and special initiatives such as Imagine Ireland, a year-long programme in the US in 2011, the Culture Programme for Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2013 and the Centenary International Culture Programme for 2016 which will be covered in more detail later. Culture Ireland also arranges cultural events around visits by members of the Government and by the President abroad. Most notable in recent times was the Ceiliúradh concert in London in 2014 to mark the President's visit to Great Britain. There was an audience of 5,000 people for this concert and it attracted 4.7 million television viewers in Ireland and Great Britain. In December 2014, to mark the State visit to China by President Higgins, Culture Ireland arranged an evening of poetry, music and dance in the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing. Culture Ireland’s showcase programme is a strategic arm of the division. It creates and builds new opportunities for Irish artists to present their work at key international festivals and venues by engaging directly with international presenters. The primary purpose of the showcase programme is to present high-quality work by Irish artists which is export-ready and to build contacts and opportunities for touring with leading presenters and promoters. Culture Ireland actively promotes the showcase programme to presenters, targets contacts to see work, makes introductions for Irish artists and establishes partnerships and relationships with key venues in which to present work. Irish work is showcased at international markets such as: the traditional music market at Celtic Connections in Glasgow every January; rock and indie music at SXSW in Austin, Texas every March; wider music at the World Music Expo, WOMEX; literature at Frankfurt Bookfair; art and architecture at the Venice Biennales; and theatre at the Edinburgh festivals, where year after year Irish artists have attracted awards in what is a competitive marketplace. Culture Ireland also supports incoming buyers annually to see work at the Dublin Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival and the Hard Working Class Heroes music festival. To date, this year it has supported more than 100 buyers and presenters to visit Ireland to attend the following festivals and select works for international presentation: the 12 Points Festival jazz festival, the Temple Bar Tradfest, the Choice Music Awards, the Dublin International Film Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, the Dublin Fringe Festival, the Dublin Theatre Festival and the Hard Working Class Heroes music festival. Each of these showcases has yielded positive results in new contracts for artists. St. Patrick’s Day is a key time for Culture Ireland to deliver globally across all artistic platforms, taking account of Government priorities and proposed visits. In 2015, for example, Culture Ireland allocated funding in excess of €200,000 to support more than 50 events in 22 countries. The culture programme coincides in many locations with visits by key Government-led delegations, which ensures the maximum impact can be generated through the investment. Culture Ireland funds a number of key organisations on an annual basis. They are the Ireland Literature Exchange which arranges for the translation of Irish literature into other languages; the Irish Film Institute which provides Irish films for festivals and venues worldwide; as well as the arts programme in Ireland's two international arts centres, namely, Centre Culturel in Paris and the Irish Arts Centre in New York. Culture Ireland's annual funding in 2014 and 2015 was €2.5 million. In 2016 its allocation will be doubled to €5 million to enable it to deliver a special international programme as part of the
Ireland 2016 centenary programme which will have a special focus on key territories, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is for our artists and their talents that Ireland is known globally and for 2016 I am committed to the special programme, I am Ireland, a copy of which members should have in front of them. It is inspired by the opening line of one of Pearse's poems, Mise Éire. I am Ireland speaks of a contemporary Ireland and will involve young and established artists presenting at international festivals and venues. The interest in Irish artistic excellence continues to grow internationally and 2016 will offer the opportunity to build on Ireland's cultural connections and share many special and diverse events with audiences around the world. Culture Ireland works on a cross-agency basis, most notably with Tourism Ireland and the embassy network, to raise the profile of the Irish arts globally. Irish artists continue to excel and win awards and critical acclaim on the world stage. Culture Ireland plays a key role in Ireland’s international promotional strategy, generating jobs for artists, creating an awareness of the strength of Ireland's creativity and supporting artists, Ireland's greatest ambassadors.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of members. I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make the presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Seanadóir for his questions. On the future of Culture Ireland and strengthening it, I came in contact with it for the first time as Minister of State. I have seen the reach and power it has, which is quite remarkable. Figures were given to me earlier today for the level of investment and showing the global reach. A figure was given to me for the cost of sending certain artists to the United States and showing the promotional feedback. The advertising and promotion revenue from it far outstripped the initial investment, which is quite remarkable. The investment was €7 million but €22 million was recouped in media advertising. The media coverage was extensive. For the remainder of the term of the Government and if we continue to be part of the next Government, I am determined to ensure the independence of Culture Ireland will be strictly guarded and strengthened and that it will retain its separate identity as its work is unique. It must maintain its independence in that regard. Even though there were a number of references in the presentation to the economic worth of Culture Ireland and the fact that it could be connected with trade visits and attracting tourists to the country, the importance of the arts must be protected for what they are, not just for their economic value. As we come out of the economic constraints of the past, to which Senator Fiach Mac Conghail referred, and as we talk about what will happen in the future, we can consider funding for the arts, the type of lifestyle and career one can realistically have in the artistic space - there are many such matters that we must discuss - but Culture Ireland is much more than an add-on to a trade mission. It promotes the artistic and creative space on its own merits and value. Criticism of the arts in this country - perhaps it happens internationally also - is at the top and bottom of every political priority list. When a foreign dignitary comes to the country, we try to promote the economy or the tourism sector and the arts and cultural aspects of the country are given top priority. They are the first things we talk about, yet sometimes when it comes to funding, they can be on the bottom rung of the ladder.Perhaps it has been given, unfairly and unjustifiably, the sense of being a bit of a luxury where other things are more important. I made the point the other day at another event that the groups I dealt with in my equality role which were on the edges of Irish society and included Travellers, people with an addiction and those suffering from economic disadvantage, all needed the arts and a cultural space in which to express what they were going through and give expression to the human condition. We should not in any way diminish the importance of culture or what Culture Ireland does. We are looking at the wider 2016 programme linking with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, with the diaspora. The locations mentioned will be key areas of connectivity for Ireland next year. That is why they are being mentioned. Many of them are areas in which people speak English and they are the main markets for many of our artists. Recently I have had a lot of contact with the Irish Literature Exchange. It is expanding with the revolution of young writers in Ireland who are beginning to translate their works into many international languages. It is remarkable to see their global reach. The answer to the question on whether we are constrained to these markets is "No", but they will be the main markets and the main areas into which we will try to push during 2016.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The embassy and Tourism Ireland provided special funding of €300,000 for the Ceiliúradh which was curated by Philip King. It was a once off event for a particular reason. The visit by President Higgins to the United Kingdom was of particular historical significance; therefore, a special designation was given to the visit because of this. Anybody who witnessed the event and celebration would have very much been taken by it and would certainly have said it was money well spent and an event worth attending, particularly because of its historical significance. Will the Chairman, please, repeat his second question?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Culture Ireland is the driver, but it must have a sense of the embassies and the dynamics of the country. While it is certainly the driver, advice is taken to understand cultural sensitivities or the particular needs of the embassy at the time. Culture Ireland will definitely be the driver and initiator and the organisation promoting funding and allocating resources, but it must take account of what the embassies are thinking and feeling and what they want to do. Culture Ireland is the main body, but everything will happen in consultation and conjunction with other stakeholders.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to present to it the draft Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2015. These draft regulations relate to provisions concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each House of the Oireachtas must approve draft regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The draft amending regulations make changes to the exempted development provisions set out in the planning and development regulations 2001 to 2015. These amendments relate to changes of use of particular types of premises providing accommodation and include changes that have general application, in addition to amendments specific to particular classes of persons. The change of general application is the insertion of a new subclass of exempted development, class 14(g), into Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the planning and development regulations, which comprises the change of use of a premises from a hotel to a hostel. Under this amendment, a premises previously operated as a hotel may be used to accommodate persons in hostel-type accommodation. While the change of use is not confined to any particular class of persons, this amendment will be of particular benefit in clarifying the planning status of hotels that provide accommodation for homeless persons, asylum seekers and refugees. This exemption does not apply to a hostel where care is provided. In this connection, the existing regulations define “care” to mean personal care, including help with physical, educational or social needs. It should also be noted that, except in the specific case provided for in another proposed subclass of exempted development, the amending regulations do not provide that the change of use of a premises in the other direction, from a hostel to a hotel, shall constitute exempted development. Allied to exempting the change of use of a hotel to a hostel from planning requirements, the draft regulations amend two definitions in the planning and development regulations to remove the distinction in them between a hotel and a hostel. The amendment of one of these definitions, that relating to “business premises”, allows hostels to benefit from the same classes of exempted development relating to renewable energy infrastructure that is currently available to other business premises, including hotels. The other main changes in the draft regulations relate to facilitating the use for refugees and asylum seekers, as defined in legislation for which the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible, of particular accommodation-type premises without recourse to the planning system. The types of premises involved are a hotel, motel, hostel, guesthouse, holiday accommodation, convent, monastery, Defence Forces barracks or other premises or residential institution providing overnight accommodation. As indicated, under the proposed changes, planning permission will not be required for the use of these types of premises to accommodate refugees and asylum seekers or as emergency reception and orientation centres for such persons. These changes are made by inserting new subclasses 14(h) and 14(i), respectively, into Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the planning and development regulations 2001 to 2015. Furthermore, a change of use of these types of premises from one of these subclasses to the other will not require planning permission.These specific exempted development provisions will allow the Government to continue its humanitarian policy of providing protection and accommodation to those most in need under its refugee resettlement programme in association with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Irish refugee protection programme and the related establishment of emergency reception and orientation centres as part of our EU and international commitments in this regard and the provision of accommodation to those arriving into the State and seeking asylum here. The draft amending regulations insert a further consequential subclass into the planning regulations, that is to say class 14(j), under which a premises where the use changed under class 14(h) or (i) may be returned to its former permitted use within three years without planning permission being required. Assuming the draft regulations are approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, they will come into force as soon as they are made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I commend the draft regulations to the committee and I will endeavour to answer any questions members may have on this matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes for attending this meeting.  I would first like to hear from Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes their understanding of the term "public interest directors".
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yet, in response to previous questions, the witnesses cannot identify how their approach is different from that of other bank directors.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«By the public interest, does Ms Hayes mean the wider economy?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I think most people listening to the previous replies will be disturbed to hear phrases such as "consensus decision making" and "very few votes".  Do the witnesses think the public would find that a bit troubling in terms of the witnesses' role, how they perceive that role, how they view the public interest and their interest in the wider economy?  However, when they attend board meeting, there is a level of consensus between what the witnesses think and what other bank directors think in terms of decision making.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is there ever a vote on any matter?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does Mr. MacSharry think that the public who put their faith in him battling on their behalf will find that a bit strange?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was stated, almost as an achievement, that 80% of the mortgages are performing loans.  Does Ms Hayes consider a loan that is in negative equity to be a performing loan, even if the mortgage is being repaid and there are no arrears?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Most people would find that statement strange that the 80% of performing loans, includes the negative equity loans.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is the problem with statistics.  Mr. MacSharry states that 80% of mortgages are performing loans.  However, most ordinary members of the public who are looking to him to battle on their behalf would look at that statistic and wonder that the 80% contains mortgages in serious negative equity which can be repaid, but could hardly be described as performing.  I can only imagine the difficulties that the remaining 20% of borrowers are in.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In respect of those loans, I think there was a play on words or a misunderstanding of the phraseology when we discussed write-offs, write-downs and debt forgiveness.  Most people want to know the absolute definition and how the witnesses define the difference between write-off and debt forgiveness.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is that the way the system worked or is it the way the system will work as a result of the current mortgage crisis?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Have there been write-offs in the institution in which Mr. MacSharry is a public interest director?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not necessarily a change in policy, it is just how things are done.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«So it is not a reaction to the current mortgage crisis?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like both witnesses to respond to questions on the overarching policy.  There has been no change in policy, effectively.  There has been on an individual, case-by-case basis but there is no overarching change in policy as a result of the mortgage crisis.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is no overarching policy difference?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The variable rate went from 5.19% to 4.5% in recent months.  Is that correct?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«One of my constituents tells me she is being punished for the stupidity and greed of the decision makers in Permanent TSB who sold too many tracker mortgages.  Do the delegates agree?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Given what happened during the boom and bubble years, when all of these tracker mortgages were being sold, do the delegates not agree that it amounted to stupidity and greed?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to ask the Governor about a financial transactions tax. Eleven eurozone countries have recently signed up to proceed with a tax on their financial transactions. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said that such a tax would put 33,000 jobs in the IFSC at risk and that he would not do it without the co-operation of the UK. At a recent event in Dublin I spoke to Ed Balls, MP, who said that even as an opposition politician he would not agree with a financial transaction tax in the UK without the co-operation of New York. In June 2010 the Governor said that such a tax would do little for improving the efficiency or safety of the financial system and would not generate as much revenue as some would suppose. At a level of 0.1%, how much would such a tax raise? Does he still hold the view that it would do little for improving the efficiency or safety of the financial system in Ireland? I would like to get as tight language as we possibly can on the Government's ambition to exit the EU-IMF programme in 2013. Does the Governor believe such a target is achievable and credible?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Do I have any time left?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Governor has not answered my question about how much it might raise. I understand those 11 eurozone countries have signed up to a rate of 0.1%. How much would that raise in the Irish context? He has said the consequences for job losses or the impact on the economy would not be as grave as some people suggest. I ask him to flesh out the consequences it might have and how much it might raise in Ireland.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Many of the questions have been asked, but if the Minister does not mind, I will go over a few points again about Aer Lingus, the stimulus and the potential merger of Coillte and Bord na Móna. Instinctively, I welcome the decision on Aer Lingus. The Minister said that at the moment optimal conditions do not exist for a sale of the Government's remaining shareholding. Deputy Humphreys spoke about the competition considerations, and we want to maximise its value in time but in terms of influencing commercial policy at Aer Lingus, surely a 25% share is effectively useless.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a shame that the vast bulk of the discussion today has focused not on what we are trying to invest in in terms of the job creation measures and the stimulus. That is the nub of the issue, and it is a success story that we are not selling off assets just to shift the debt but to reinvest in the economy. The Minister referred to traditional investments. They seem to be quite construction heavy. I heard that at the height of the boom approximately 18% of the economy was based around the construction industry. It has collapsed to around 3%. The figure for the average economy is 7%. Will the Minister expand on the investments that will be made? How would he respond to the suggestion that they are construction heavy and that perhaps they should go into other areas? He mentioned Ireland being a potential wind energy exporter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Would the Minister expand on the comment he made earlier about the potential for Ireland being a major exporter of energy?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is my final question, and I thank the Minister for his answers. The potential merger between Coillte and Bord na Móna sounds like an arduous process. Am I wrong about that? Will it not be that problematic?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have two main topics. I will come to Priory Hall later, but my main question is on variable interest rates versus tracker mortgages. Last April-May the ECB reduced its interest rates, but this was not passed on to customers with variable interest rate mortgages. Then there was a 0.4% increase for AIB customers with variable rate mortgages and a 0.25% increase for those in EBS. I said in the Dáil at the time that there seemed to be a syndication between what the ECB did and what AIB did with its variable interest rate mortgages. The point has already been made that outside the distressed loans category there are quite a number of mortgage holders who are feeding their mortgages possibly before they are feeding their children. They are struggling to pay their mortgages and succeeding, but an interest rate increase could tip them over the edge and then the bank will have to deal with that issue. Every time this happens there is a conversation about passing on interest rate cuts to variable rate customers and it does not happen. The last time there was an increase. It has been suggested to me that the accumulated wisdom among the delegates is that a 5.5% interest rate for variable rate mortgage holders is the most sustainable for the bank to continue in the future and that the current rate is unsustainable. I would like to get AIB's response to this. Is what has been suggested to me wrong?Does Mr. Duffy believe rates can remain at the current level? What does he foresee happening in the future in regard to variable interest rate mortgages and how does he react to the charge that AIB is forcing variable interest rate mortgage holders to pay for tracker mortgage holders remaining as they are?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Has Mr. Byrne calculated within that the damage an interest rate increase of that nature would do to impaired loans or distressed mortgages?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I look forward to quoting that next year, when I hope Mr. Duffy will have been proved right and I will have been proved wrong.With regard to Priory Hall, I reiterate that so many families are clinging to every word that is being said by people in the banks, so I will give the witnesses the opportunity to say what they want to about Priory Hall as carefully as they can. When the residents hear about "new homes" or a "final solution", they want to know what the terms mean. We all know how difficult the position is and I agree with others that there are a number of other issues coming down the tracks for this and other banks because of the mad sellotape-type construction of the past 15 years. The period of "a number of weeks" has been mentioned, along with "positive solutions" and "new homes". These words will be pored over, read and clung to by people in a desperate position, so I would give two minutes to the witnesses to allow them say what they want. That would be very much appreciated by everybody.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Before giving the witness the chance to answer, I make the point that the families have said this bank has been more positive in dealing with this issue than any other. That is not saying much but it is saying something.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does that include EBS?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the witnesses. I will focus on three elements, namely, the performing loan book, Priory Hall and Bank of Ireland's branch consolidation or opening of new branches. In a point I also raised yesterday regarding the performing loan book, I note Bank of Ireland's statement that 89% of loans are performing. In a way, that tells a lie because many people in that category are struggling each month to pay their mortgage. As I stated yesterday, they probably are feeding the mortgage before feeding their children. Do the witnesses have to hand analysis as to how anyone in that performing book may dip into arrears or be part of Bank of Ireland's arrears problem in the coming years? In particular, I am thinking about variable interest rates and note Bank of Ireland increased its variable interest rate by 0.5% last year. There is a feeling among mortgage holders that those who are on variable interest rates are being played off against those who are on tracker rates. What are Bank of Ireland's projections over perhaps five years, as to how it will protect those people or ensure those who are "performing" do not dip into arrears? While the bank may consider them to be performing, many of them are struggling.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will come back to the other ones.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have not yet asked a question on Priory Hall. However, on the variable interest rate, yesterday AIB stated it did not envisage any increase in the next 12 months. Can Bank of Ireland also give that assurance?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes, on variable interest rates.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Members had a reasonably constructive conversation about Priory Hall with AIB yesterday. I made the point yesterday that while this is not saying much, its residents state that AIB is the better of the banks with which to deal. AIB spoke about positive solutions, new homes and dealing with each individual resident on its books in the next number of weeks. What is Bank of Ireland's position in respect of Priory Hall?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Bank of Ireland has made contact with these eight account holders. How frequently has it made contact with them?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Were Bank of Ireland to contact them with the type of language used by AIB yesterday, they might be more willing to talk to the bank because AIB is now talking about positive solutions and new homes in the next number of weeks.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Which will lead to what?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I refer to the resolution of what is a particularly unusual situation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With respect, considering what members were told yesterday and the "generosity" then on offer regarding this particular situation, yesterday they were given a sense of hope, vision and understanding as to how quickly and positively this situation can be resolved.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I hope Bank of Ireland does. However, if I may finish the question, I am not getting any sense from Mr. Boucher that Bank of Ireland has any solution, positive or negative, in mind. Mr. Boucher is just talking about a process and while everyone knows there is a process, I wish to ascertain what Bank of Ireland considers to be a reasonable outcome for these families who obviously are under considerable stress, considering that the bank still is accumulating interest on the loans they have with it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Mr. Boucher already stated that. However, I wish to know to what is Bank of Ireland open.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am a little disappointed with the vagueness of Mr. Boucher's responses. I do not get any sense of imagination as to how he thinks he can give a sense of hope, considering what the joint committee heard yesterday.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«While not much time remains to me, my last point pertains to branches.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The witnesses' bank, albeit not the gentlemen who are present in particular, has caused an incredible amount of pain to this country and to people living in this country, as have other banks. This era in our history will be spoken of for ten, 20, 30,100 or 200 years to come. I refer to the former site of the Irish Parliament at College Green, which is currently in the bank's hands. Given recent events within Bank of Ireland, do the witnesses not think it would be a reasonable suggestion for the bank to do what the Government has suggested should be done and as a gesture to the Irish people, give that site back to them?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In fairness, the Minister and others have suggested in the past that considering its historical significance, it would be a symbolic gesture for that to be transferred into the hands of the State. Mr. Boucher's gratitude is nice, but pretty meaningless. In terms of a physical transfer of an iconic building, would that be a lasting gesture on the bank's behalf to the Irish people that would be seen as something that would be welcome, and one could look to the future with confidence?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I meant-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I said Mr. Boucher's gratitude was meaningless.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In terms of the tangible material of the College Green bank-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«So it is a "No".
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In summary, I am not getting a significant amount of comfort from Mr. Boucher's strategic plan for those 89% in performing loans and some of those within that group of customers who may be in distress in the coming years. For those Priory Hall residents, although there are only eight, I am getting very little positivity. In terms of the gesture that might be given in terms of the Irish Parliament building in College Green, I am getting nothing at all. However, I appreciate Mr. Boucher's responding to my question.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Ulster Bank representatives to the committee. Representatives from Bank of Ireland stated here earlier that the majority of distressed mortgages in their bank are tracker mortgages. Is that the position in Ulster Bank's case?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is Ulster Bank working proactively or has it a policy to get more of its customer base off tracker mortgages? Are they dragging the bank down?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If tracker mortgages are, in Mr. Brown's words, a drag on the industry, does that mean there is extra pain being front-loaded on those on different types of mortgage?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I got two very different answers from AIB and Bank of Ireland when I asked about the potential for an increase in the variable interest rate in the next year. The AIB representative stated he could not really foresee it and the Bank of Ireland representative stated he would not rule it out. What is Mr. Brown's view?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will the bank be engaging with those on tracker mortgages and can they expect contact from the bank with a range of products that the bank thinks may be more favourable to them?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On strategic defaulters, it is a little like when people talk about social welfare where the word "fraud" is always included. Sometimes I wonder whether this is part of the policy in the banking system where the banks talk about defaulters, the word "strategic" gets in there and, before one knows it, that seems to be all we talk about. I am not necessarily suggesting that the Ulster Bank representatives are doing that. Those are merely my own thoughts. AIB's representatives told the committee that they felt 20% of those with distressed mortgages were strategic defaulters. I apologise if Mr. Brown has already answered this question. Would the position be similar at Ulster Bank? Did Mr. Brown give a different figure?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In Mr. Brown's experience, are these mainly buy-to-let properties or are they owner-occupiers?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Why would somebody want to strategically default on a property that is their only property that they are living in?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Surely someone who is a strategic defaulter, in Mr. Brown's terms, of an owner-occupied home, is not somebody who is being devious. It is somebody who needs help.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Would they be frightened? Is that the reason?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If strategic defaulting is a problem as identified by Mr. Brown and if somebody is frightened to deal with a bank and is an owner-occupier, surely the bank would have imaginative ways of dealing with that situation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The reason I am saying this is because when people start throwing out terminology such as "strategic defaulters", what forms in somebody's mind is an image of somebody who has a broad portfolio, is merely playing the system, is trying to out-fox the bank and is not playing ball whereas what we possibly have is somebody who is terrified of hearing the telephone ring.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Okay. I have two quick questions. The first is on the link between mortgage arrears and unemployment. Would Mr. Brown accept that many mortgages should not have been given out?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Given the financial situation of the families and individuals involved and their income at that time, would he accept they should not have been given those mortgages?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In my mind, it is the same question.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sure that experience will teach Mr. Brown as to how to manage the bank's affairs in the future and the bank would never go back to that kind of practice ever again.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would assume these things are written up in 9 ft. letters on the side of a wall somewhere in Ulster Bank?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would hope so. I know Mr. Brown has already made some comments about Priory Hall. The families involved in Priory Hall are clinging to every sentence from Mr. Brown. We had two different responses. The response from AIB was reasonably positive and said it would deal individually with families and that in a number of weeks it should have positive solutions for these families. It was disregarding the court case and everything else and said it would be generous, open and honest and try to find a solution for these families in the short term. This was welcomed by the families. The response heard earlier today was not as encouraging. We can easily say it can be done on a case-by-case basis and use the proper formal language or Ulster Bank can say that it is aware that the situation is unique and that it can find imaginative and positive solutions to it. Mr. Brown can give me the coal-face, strait-laced banker answer or he can give me something that the families will respond more positively to but it is over to him.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does Ulster Bank feel it can be imaginative?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does Ulster Bank think it will be led by what other banks do?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will conclude with this. We got a positive answer from AIB but did not get a great response from Bank of Ireland but at least it said it might be influenced by what other banks might do in that regard. What I am getting from Mr. Brown is that Ulster Bank will approach it on a case-by-case basis and will not be influenced by any other factors.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Let me assure the Deputy that there is nothing wrong with a bit of good left-wing rhetoric.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«All of the other banks have made clear their positions on Priory Hall. Allied Irish Bank was the most positive; Bank of Ireland stated it would be led by other banks, while Ulster Bank was less than positive. Perhaps Mr. Masding might set out what he believes PTSB can do for its mortgage holders of properties in Priory Hall.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have a final question. Mr. Duffy has said this is happening over the next number of weeks so can that commitment be given as well?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is contact being made with the individuals involved?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will there be a resolution in the foreseeable future?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the witnesses. Representatives of Chambers Ireland, the Small Firms Association and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation will address the committee later this afternoon, after this part of the meeting has concluded. They will tell us that taxation is satanic and that the measures being proposed will strangle the economy, etc. Other people like to use the word "fraud" as often as they can during discussions on social welfare in order to undermine the social welfare budget. The first of my two main questions relates to the long-term structural tackling of poverty, for example, by means of preschool provision. We need to tackle things like maternal depression, educational disadvantage and illiteracy. What can we do in this budget to tackle such issues at a root and branch level to ensure the situation is not worse five, ten or 20 years from now for the most vulnerable children with whom we are dealing at present? My second question might be a loaded one. I will ask it anyway. The witnesses do not have to answer it. It relates to the posturing that was done last year by the two parties in government. One party demanded higher taxation and the other party demanded an across-the-board cut of 3% in social welfare payments. What kind of damage would an across-the-board cut of 3% in social welfare payments do to the people with whom these organisations are dealing every day?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to ask about the ring-fencing of funds. Many of the suggestions presented by our guests make a great deal of sense. We should try to support them in whatever way possible. However, the Department of Finance always reacts very badly to any suggestion of ring fencing, which is does not like. Bizarrely enough, however, it has no difficulty in ring-fencing funds for horse and greyhound racing through legislation. I refer to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, by means of which money procured via a levy which applies to every bet placed throughout the country is immediately placed in the horse and greyhound racing fund. When it comes to ring-fencing funding relating to mental health, children or anti-poverty strategies, however, the Department does not like it. Will our guests indicate how practical or justifiable they consider ring-fencing to be, particularly in the context of the fact that it is considered fine for horses but not for poor, sick or vulnerable people?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome all the guests. There are two ways of looking at the budget. One is to say that it has to meet the deficit target set out, which should be €3.1 billion. The other is to say that we can meet the targets by having a much less austere budget. Do the witnesses have a general opinion on what budgetary measures should be taken, considering that the toughness of the budget will have a disproportionate effect on carers and those parts of our society which depend so much on direct payments from the State? I get a sense from the IFA's submission and comments that there is a sense of hope or expectation that things might be turning or improving a little and that the agricultural sector can be a leader in the Irish economy to get us out of where we are. Could the IFA representatives expand on that a little as to how they feel matters are progressing? I will ask a controversial question on maintenance and college grants. I want to tease it out without being adversarial. I understand the IFA's position - the self-employed have a similar view - on the proposal that productive assets be taken into consideration for maintenance grants. We spend approximately €300 million on third-level grants. The suggestion is that productive assets of €750,000 would be taken into consideration. If that figure is far too low for the IFA's estimation, is there a figure that could be worked around - €1 million, €2 million, €3 million, €5 million? Or does the IFA have an opinion on the level of savings an individual might have to suggest that he or she does not need a maintenance grant to send his or her child to college? Somebody who had €250,000 in his or her bank account was entitled to everything the Department of Education and Skills could give to send his or her child to college. I am not deliberately trying to cause a row, but the best thing we can do is to toss around these ideas and see what the IFA's thinking is on this.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«May I make a comment on that before the other speakers come in on the broader questions? We are completely in agreement - nobody should ever have to make a choice between education and their livelihood. Any changes should be on the basis that those who demonstrably can afford to pay for the maintenance of their children in college should be asked to do so. It is just a question of finding the mechanism. I appreciate the IFA's point of view on the matter. We all want the first person in generations of a family to have the opportunity to go to university. But if that person is drawing from the same €300 million as others, bearing in mind all the other strains on the budget, we need to find a mechanism. It is not an issue solely for the IFA; it is also an issue for self-employed people. I went to college with people who came from the same area of Dublin as I did. They got college grants that I did not get because I came from a family with a PAYE worker. It is unfairly suggested that it is an IFA or farming issue. We need to find a mechanism whereby those with the ability to pay do so, but I accept Mr. Bryan's comments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Ms McVeigh and her colleagues for their presentation. A financial transaction tax or Tobin tax is something everybody instinctively supports and considers a good idea. However, when one examines the potential ramifications in terms of costs to customers, job losses at the IFSC and so on, it becomes a little more complicated. Is the Department's position essentially that Ireland will stay out of a financial transaction tax arrangement so long as the United Kingdom does the same?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is Ms McVeigh saying that it is not necessarily the Department's fixed position?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My understanding of the UK position is that it is not simply a case of Government versus Opposition. In fact, both of the main parties are opposed to an FTT on the basis of what might happen in New York as a consequence of its introduction. Would Ms McVeigh agree that there is a range of interdependent issues to consider?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like some clarity on what seems to be the evolving opinion or consensus on this issue. The Governor of the Central Bank made a speech some 18 months ago in which he was very critical of the proposal for a financial transaction tax. He placed heavy emphasis in that speech on potential jobs losses and the disproportionate impact on the Irish financial sector. However, when he attended a meeting of this committee more recently - not last week but on the occasion prior to that - and I asked him his current view on an FTT, it seemed his position had softened somewhat. I do not have the transcript of that meeting to hand, but his position certainly seemed to have shifted. Is Ms McVeigh aware of that shift in the Governor's view? Is there regular liaison between the Department and the Central Bank on this issue?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am interested in the evolution of thinking on this issue and how views can change within the Irish and European contexts. Are the Department and the Central Bank in regular contact on the issue or is it something on which the Department has already made a determination without any expectation that the position is likely to change significantly?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ms McVeigh spoke earlier about the cost to customers and potential job losses arising out of the introduction of an FTT. Will she expand on that? Can she indicate, for instance, in a worst case scenario, where such a tax were imposed on us - I realise it would not actually happen that way - what level of job losses could we potentially see?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sure Ms McVeigh understands that we are concerned here with trying to weigh up the rationale for the introduction of a financial transaction tax. We would like to be able to quantify the number of jobs that could potentially be at risk versus the potential gains. Every move one makes in any budgetary situation has pros and cons. It is a question of weighing them up and making a value judgment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is there a variance among the 11 member states in which an FTT is already in operation in terms of the types of institutions covered?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am asking that question in reference to the 11 countries which have already introduced an FTT. Is there a variance between what is happening in France and Italy, for example?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it the intention to analyse that data when they become available?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are trying to obtain a sense of the validity or otherwise of imposing such a tax and the likely impact on different member states. If we were in possession of that data, perhaps we might arrive at a better judgment in respect of this matter. Will the Department and the Revenue Commissioners be analysing the data on a member state basis to obtain a comparison? If the answer is in the affirmative, perhaps our guests might return to the committee with the relevant data in order that we might engage in a more informed discussion on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be useful for the committee to revisit this evolving issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the delegates. The report is interesting, as is much of the information given in response to questions. We had all assumed the Central Bank was in the business of ensuring people were not exploited. When the Central Bank engages with people on the receiving end of these loans, whom it states it is trying to protect, how do the delegates describe an APR of 287%?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is there an adjective Mr. Sheridan would use? Would he describe it as excessive?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would describe an interest rate of 287% as pornographic, but that is just me. Mr. Sheridan talks about people who want short-term loans, but if they want short-term loans at that range, between 23% and 287%, it means that they have something in their lives they want to finance at short notice. It could be the cost of a funeral or Christmas expenses and concerns something they cannot afford but that they must get over. There could be an element of trauma attached to it. Is this the experience of Mr. Sheridan?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They will take money at any cost in order to get through this period.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I must look at it in those terms because Mr. Sheridan has said he has engaged with lenders and that is the basis of his report. I assume he talked to the MABS which has done a lot of work with the Traveller community on the reasons moneylending becomes a problem in that community. Surely he has some appreciation of the reasons people need short-term loans and, at difficult times in their lives, they are wide open to being exploited by some of these guys.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is always the argument made against doing anything. With any legal vice in society, people say that if we touch or regulate it too much, it will move underground. Is that a good enough excuse?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not an encouraging balance that we are trying to strike here. To go back to the issue of those who need short-term loans, the suggestion from the witnesses is that they would resist an interest rate cap. Surely anybody listening to this conversation or studying these figures would say that any interest rate that creeps up to 287% has to be challenged, controlled and driven down. People are only going to engage with a regulated industry that they can trust and that they fundamentally believe will not exploit them. I do not think the argument about the potential for driving people into the underground market holds much water. Do the witnesses believe there is room for manoeuvre on this? The legislative body of which we are all Members has a responsibility to help the witnesses out and we must take that responsibility seriously. However, we are not in the business of allowing people to be exploited. What we are doing here essentially is saying that it is very sad that Mrs. Murphy is being charged over 200% for a loan to get her through a devastating period in her life but, hey, that is just the way it is. That seems to be the general consensus from the body politic and the Central Bank.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does that mean that 88% said "No"? What did the others say?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My first question on retrospective recapitalisation has already been discussed.  The Minister indicated that the situation has changed since the statement of June 2012 but where stands that statement?  Does it remain the basis for his negotiations?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister previously spoke about how our situation has changed and stated that our debt is perceived to be more sustainable, even though the interest repayment on the bank portion of our debt is €1.6 billion
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Many people would take the view that it is not sustainable.  To return to my main point, the Government is holding fast to the statement of June 2012.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The European Commission statement warned the Government about raising false expectations of tax cuts and spending increases.  Does the Minister want to comment on that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My final point is the financial transaction tax, FTT, which I raise as often as I can.  At the last ECOFIN meeting, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne raised the possibility of taking a legal challenge against the imposition of the FTT, and Ireland is not going to support him in that.  Approximately a year ago we had a conversation here with Patrick Honohan, who seemed to have softened his approach to the FTT.  He felt circumstances had changed and that it would not have as detrimental an effect as previously perceived.  The argument is that we would not support it if the UK did not support it, and that the UK would not support it if New York did not support it.  Is that still our view, or has it changed?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the members of the committee and the panel for their kind comments. Professor Bury's presentation is one of the most impressive presentations on this issue that I have heard in the past number of years. He spoke in stark terms. He repeated one of his sentences in order to ensure that we all understood the magnitude of the situation and how drug overdose has reached epidemic level. He stated twice that in Ireland, more people die from opiate overdose each year than in road accidents. I agree with much of what has been said by other members of the committee. I also agree with the sentiments expressed by Professor Bury about the day-to-day work done by the people who work on the front line. They save lives and deal in a very inglorious area of volunteerism or their professional life of caring for people who really live on the edge. It has been said that the term "junkie" is often used. It is one of the last derogatory terms that is politically acceptable or acceptable in the media to throw around the place. Even though the word "junkie" is a disgusting term it is deliberately used to undermine anyone who suffers from addiction. Whenever we discuss how an injection facility can save lives and alleviate the suffering of addicts the first question that is always asked is where will it be located. In other words, the debate feeds into the idea that the people who would benefit from a facility are undesirable and a subspecies. The media and others use the term "junkie" in a derogatory manner to underline that message. Senator Colm Burke mentioned that people have yet to be convinced there is a need for an injection facility. During the many months that the facility was debated the Temple Bar traders never contacted my office when I was the Minister responsible for the drugs strategy. It is only lately that we got a letter from them. The traders are in an excited state and we are happy to debate the matter. Where have they been for the last period?  I ask the delegation to put this matter in a human context. I ask them to describe the visual nature of somebody who has died, and they can tell a story that they are aware of or give an instant that they have handled themselves personally. People die in toilets. People die behind dumpsters. People die in urine-soaked stairwells. They die surrounded by blood and faeces and they die all of the time. People do not like to hear that people die on the streets of this city and other cities around the country. I can appreciate Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's desire for a full programme of injection facilities to be rolled out rather than just a pilot programme because his city needs one. I ask the witnesses to explain in human terms the rationale for having a facility. Professor Bury hit the nail on the head with his presentation. A campaign has been deliberately orchestrated to ensure that everybody is on board. The retailers who have a concern about the drugs paraphernalia have been convinced that a facility will alleviate the problem. I agree that it is unfair to expect Dublin City Council workers to pick up or sweep up this material and the accompanying excrement. A broad umbrella of people have reached the conclusion that a facility is necessary for different reasons. Fundamentally, a facility is not about having cleaner streets but about saving lives. I ask the witnesses to explain in human terms that the facility will save the lives of people whose lives need to be saved. I ask the witnesses to describe in graphic terms what people need to know and I mean that with the best respect in the world for the Temple Bar traders or whoever else opposes the facility. I want them to hear what really happens in the city in which I live and in which many people here live, or in cities around the country. The Chairman has asked for statistics on the number of people whose lives have been saved as a result of the facility. I believe we will reach the point when this programme becomes more than a pilot and, as a result, we will be able to provide statistics in support of such facilities. Professor Bury made an interesting correlation between opiate overdose and road deaths. It took between 20 or 25 measures to reduce the number of road deaths. An injection facility will not reduce the number of overdoses overnight. As Deputy O'Brien has said, the programme along with possibly 20 or more measures will eventually reduce the number of people who die from an overdose or are addicted in Ireland. A facility is not a panacea but is part of the jigsaw.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Deputy O'Brien would have six to one then.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be brief. I understand that the witnesses are restricted in what they can say because the Department has to implement Government policy, the Garda has to implement law and personal opinions do not come into it. I understand that terminology is important and the idea of this centre being policed is not what we want to emerge from these proceedings, but streets and areas are policed. I visited a centre in Rotterdam and the injecting room there was one small component of the overall centre. There were a range of activities in the centre ranging from counselling to interactions. If what we achieve here is an injecting centre, just a room where people inject, then it will fail. It must be part of a much wider suite of services for people. A common question that will be asked is how one interacts with an individual whom gardaí in the area know has an illegal substance on their person as they proceed to the centre. I would say, and many people would agree with me, that this person is making a leap of trust in engaging with these services and he or she probably has many reasons from personal experience not to trust the services. A comparison could be made between this centre and the average methadone clinic or health centre that people attend, and Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned the North Strand. The average garda on the beat knows there is a higher chance of a person attending such a clinic having something illegal on their person. I ask the Garda representatives about discretion and how that is policed. The situation will be same when it comes to an injecting centre. The Garda representatives, who are knowledgeable about the law, know the difference between a person who is pushing drugs and a person who is the victim. If a person is interacting with this centre in a positive proper way, is it not similar to a person who has a chronic addiction but is going to a methadone clinic to get their methadone? Does An Garda Síochána not deal with that situation in a particular way? What we will be doing here is replicating that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to speak even though I am not a member of the committee.  I appreciate the opportunity as someone who has an interest in this area and as Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  Perhaps the witnesses would be interested in making a presentation at that forum at some stage.I was seven years of age when Senator Coghlan won his gold medal in Helsinki.  It was the first time I remember my father shouting at the television.  I also remember him telling me to look at John Treacy's white cap in Los Angeles the following year.  After that, I assumed Ireland would win medals at every major championship.  It never worked out that way.  I never get embarrassed or shy when I meet famous politicians, but I always get a bit embarrassed when I met the sporting heroes of my childhood.  I ask them to forgive me.Like others who have spoken, I am a former primary school teacher.  I am excited about the proposed initiative.  When I read Born to Run by Christopher McDougall recently, it struck me that we need to facilitate the instinctive nature of children, which is to run and be active.  If one speaks to a yoga teacher, he or she will tell one to breathe in the instinctive manner in which children breathe.  Similarly, we should focus on the instinctive manner in which children run.  Our primary school system puts children in uniforms and subjects the time that they get to be active to a compartmentalised half an hour or hour each week.  In some cases, children are not allowed to run during break time because of insurance issues.Leadership is needed from the Department of Education and Skills - during teacher training, for example - if these problems are to be tackled head-on.  I emphasise that children do not live in schools.  One of the points I made when I was involved in the national literacy strategy was that we cannot expect schools to have all the answers to the literacy problem because children do not live in schools.  The same thing applies to numeracy, educational disadvantage and the initiative we are discussing.  There must be a level of co-ordination between the HSE, public health nurses, local authorities and those engaged with parents from the early stages, because a child can present at school at the age of four with the problem already evident.  It can be more challenging then for the school to intervene, when it already has so many other issues to attend to.I fully agree with regard to subject choice at second level.  Recently I attended a presentation in a secondary school in my constituency in which physical education is only an option for pupils in the senior stream.  This is a concern, particularly in the case of girls with body image and other issues.  Another problem is the competitive nature of sport.  Some schools put a lot of emphasis on team sports, on the football, hockey or rugby team, and if a pupil is not on those teams, he or she is not involved and gets turned off.  We would all like to be an Eamonn Coghlan, a John Treacy or whoever, but what we are really aiming for is for people to be able to enjoy going out for a walk or a run and battling against themselves.  We are not trying to produce superstars, but trying to create a level of internal competition.  This element has been lost and we need to re-understand what sport is all about.  This is key in the context of teacher training and understanding.  Sports teams are great for school morale and identity, but leaving a child standing on the sideline who has been told he or she is not good enough at age 11, does more damage to that child than the good that comes from having a sports team.With regard to funding, forthcoming legislation will place a levy on online betting.  Currently, the total betting levy in Ireland goes to the horse and greyhound fund.  This is justifiable because of the importance of the industry.  However, it is suggested the new levy could raise between €30 million and €90 million.  There is potential to look at that funding stream and to target it at the obesity crisis and to having a more integrated approach towards sport and exercise.  I congratulate the council on its initiative and, perhaps, the education committee will support it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Ms Doherty for her presence today.  The remit of the NEWB under the Act is to deal with children between the ages of six and 16.  I published an amendment to that Act recently, suggesting that any child aged four or five who is enrolled in the school should come under the remit of the Act, because we cannot have early intervention unless we can intervene when a child is enrolling in the school.  Poor attendance patterns are often embedded in a child's experience, so by the time they hit six or seven years of age, when the welfare officer can intervene, it may be too late.  In my own experience, attendance patterns say a lot about the family and the aspirations of that family.  What does Ms Doherty feel about this amendment becoming law?  At the other end of the scale, there are 17 or 18 year old pupils missing any amount of days who still do not come under the remit of the Act.  Should we have a stipulation that anybody enrolled in a recognised school should come under the remit of the Act?  The Act will work for anybody within the ages of six to 16, but not for anybody outside it.I wonder how the figure of 20 days was arrived at, because 20 days is almost a target for some parents in many schools.  It is a comfort zone.  If they stay within the 20 days, they are fine.  If they go outside it, that is where the problem arises.  In my own experience, a child could have 12 or 13 days in June and knows there is a comfort zone of 20 days, so it is difficult to encourage him or her to be in attendance every single day.  Is there potential to reduce that number of days?  I am interested in hearing about the NEWB's interaction with the school completion programme and the home-school liaison service.  Also, given the importance of mental health issues at both primary and secondary level, how does it intend to address that?  Am I right in saying that the number of expulsions at post-primary level is rising?  If so, how does Ms Doherty suggest we could address this?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the expert witnesses for attending. Discussing whether suicidality should be part of the legislation is completely futile because it has to be part of it. Otherwise, the X case legislation we are bringing before the House and on which we must vote would not be in keeping with the Supreme Court judgment and the two referendums passed by the people. It would not be in keeping with the thinking on the X case, which was based on a suicidal 14 year old. I wish we could refrain from debating whether suicidal ideation should be part of the legislation because it has to be. If it were not, the legislation would not be in keeping with the Supreme Court judgment. On that basis, I ask Professor Casey, who has said legislation must be based on good medicine and fact, to note the fact that legislators must deal with the constitutional provisions laid down by the Supreme Court and the people. Given the fact that the threat of suicide will be encompassed by the legislation, how does Professor Casey believe it can best be dealt with by those practising in her field?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am not questioning anybody’s integrity. My point is that we have to legislate for suicide. It is not a question of whether people believe we should do so.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As part of the X case judgment, which we were debating, in that eventuality-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«How does the professor feel the legislation can best be dealt with?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations. I am particularly interested in the draft Bill presented by Dr. Mills. In regard to section 9 which deals with termination of pregnancy in cases of lethal foetal abnormality, my concern is that legislators will be asked to differentiate between an unsustainable pregnancy and a pregnancy which will lead to the birth of a baby who may survive for moments outside the womb. In the latter case is Dr. Mills of the view that a constitutional referendum would be necessary? It is important to clarify this unfortunate determination which legislators may face. In regard to the conscientious objection clause in section 13, is it normal practice to include such a clause within legal frameworks?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank both witnesses for their presentations. I have been an admirer of Mrs. Justice McGuinness for a long time. I particularly admire Professor Binchy's stance in the 2004 citizenship referendum. Article 34.4.6° of the Constitution states, "The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive." How does this relate to the legal certainty of how we operate here? Is it not the fact that abortion is legal in this country under the ground of the risk to the mother in terms of her mental health and suicide? I ask the witnesses to comment on the draft Bill submitted by a previous witness, Dr. Simon Mills, on the point of lethal foetal abnormality. He contends that a foetus without any prospect of life was not protected under the Constitution.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the witnesses to today's meeting. On the suicide issue, I am afraid that if people have come here to argue that suicide as a risk to the life of a mother should not be in this legislation, then there are here under a false premise. We have to legislate for the threat of suicide to the life of a mother because that is the very basis of the X case for which we are legislating. The Constitution states under Article 34.4. 6°, "The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive." We have had two referenda to underwrite and stand over that decision made in 1992. We have to legislate for suicide. The discussion we are having here is not whether or not we legislate for suicide but how best that can be done. I want to make sure the delegations answer my following question. They are here to lobby politicians. What type of lobbying do all those present believe is appropriate and inappropriate when lobbying politicians on this particular issue?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the witnesses. Yesterday Dr. Simon Mills presented a draft Bill which he felt we could work from in legislating for the X case. His Bill included a section on fatal foetal abnormality and he suggested that it would be constitutional to make such a provision. He also included a section on conscientious objection, which was part of the original British abortion law in the 1960s. I ask the witnesses their views on that. As I asked the anti-abortion groups about lobbying in the interest of balance, it is only fair that I ask the witnesses currently before us what they consider to be appropriate lobbying of Deputies and Senators on this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman for allowing me time to make a few brief remarks, and I thank the witnesses for their presentation. To consider international comparators with regard to the area-based approach, I am most familiar with West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow, where, as opposed to waiting for the national government to churn out a policy eventually, local solutions were found when an individualised problem with literacy levels among children was identified. We may need a value shift in national policy. Other jurisdictions use different language and speak about moving towards the total eradication of illiteracy, whereas we speak about tackling educational disadvantage. Do we need to be more ambitious and use terminology that depicts child poverty as a disease which must be eradicated? Are we too comfortable with where we are? What the witnesses are dealing with is a crisis of underachievement, disconnection, disempowerment and poverty. Unfortunately, when one digs deep into preventative approaches in projects involving children, there can be a great deal of fluff. Mr. Candon and I worked quite closely together in Sheriff Street for many years and had the misfortune to deal closely with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. We learned quickly the value of taking a photograph of an impoverished-looking child while sitting behind a laptop; if one takes a photograph it looks like one is doing something. It is more difficult to have a long-term strategy that can dig deep to empower the child and his or her family to find a way out of this poverty. An evidence-based approach is needed. We have spoken previously about the Hart-Risley report and the differential between the oral language skills of a three-year-old in a professional family versus those of a three-year-old in a welfare family. We have spoken about maternal depression and isolation and the huge crisis this represents in certain areas of the country. One project, which I will not name, dealt with the percentage of infant children who decided their own bedtimes. These crucial areas have not made it into mainstream discussions on what has an impact on children. Deputy Conway made a very good point that we cannot depend on the goodwill of an inspirational person. Many communities depend on such goodwill, but the State must step up to the mark. The State has been allowed off the hook by those who are willing to go the extra mile in their communities, but this is not good enough any more. Far too many services know the boundaries of their responsibilities and are very keen to stress them. These include the HSE, education services and housing authorities dealing with estate management in various communities. None of these agencies seems to have a mechanism for speaking to any other. I am taken with Mr. Candon's suggestion of an overall tsar who might be able to knock heads together and start delivering benefits for children. Parental empowerment is key. How would this be mapped over a prolonged period of time? Early intervention strategies can show great results in the fifth or sixth year of a child's life. How is this maintained over a long time when a child begins to plateau at the age of ten in primary school and cannot move to the next level of literacy that is needed to tackle secondary education? Do we need a 20 or 30-year strategy to tackle child poverty? Is there something the political system can do collectively? Party politics is one thing, but child poverty is far too important for us to play politics with, and it should not change every five years with a change of government. Do we need a plan we can all buy into for eradicating child poverty? I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses on this.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am tweeting everyone.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The reason I cited the West Dunbartonshire model was not necessarily the outcomes it had or the methodology it used but the ambition it had and terminology it used about eradicating child illiteracy. Mr. Candon mentioned Finland. We went on a trip to research Finnish education. A Conservative MP who is chair of the education committee there lectured us about the centrality of equality in Finland's education system. Both the Finnish approach and the West Dunbartonshire project are very value-driven. I agree that one cannot plant a model from somewhere else in the Irish situation but there is a poverty of ambition in our system about what we are trying to achieve. Could the witnesses comment on that and the validity of a localised solution?
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the invitation to address members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on the national drugs strategy. I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to take on a ministerial role in this area. I see it as a vital role that needs the attention of a dedicated Minister. From my work as a teacher and principal in Dublin’s north inner city, I am aware of the devastating consequences of drug abuse and the damage it causes in communities. I am deeply committed to doing all I can in my role, as Minister of State, to ensure that drug users are given the support they need to overcome addiction and once again live fulfilling lives. Since taking up my new role, I have met many people who share my concern about the extent of the drug problem in Ireland. A lot of people have said that they would like to see a change of attitudes to addiction and a more compassionate health oriented approach to those who are dependent on drugs. Too often those afflicted by addiction suffer from stigma and a lack of public understanding and education which can hold back their recovery. It is against this background that I am delighted that the justice committee is inviting public submissions on its drug policy review, with particular reference to the question of whether an alternative approach to the possession of small quantities of illicit drugs for personal use should be considered. I very much welcome a discussion on this important issue. The national drugs strategy aims to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. The strategy encourages inter-agency working in a difficult cross-cutting policy and service area.  The oversight forum on drugs, which I chair, monitors the progress in implementing the strategy. As part of the work of developing a new strategy to cover the period from 2017 onwards, I intend to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which the current strategy has provided an effective policy response to the drugs problem. I will speak in more detail later about my plans in this area. In order to have an informed evidence-based approach to drug policies, we need accurate information on the nature and extent of drug use. The national drugs prevalence survey, which is carried out by the national advisory committee on drugs and alcohol, is a key source of such information. Fieldwork for the fourth wave of the survey in 2014-2015 is at an advanced stage. I look forward to the first results bulletin becoming available later this year. This will give the key findings on drug use and will enable comparisons with the three previous surveys undertaken in 2010-2011, 2006-2007 and 2002-2003. The nature and scale of the drugs problem is constantly changing. While levels of illegal drug use stabilised between the 2006-2007 and 2010-2011 surveys, drug use in Ireland has increased over the past decade. Cannabis is now the most commonly used illegal drug in Ireland with 6% of those surveyed reporting use of the drug in the year prior to the survey. The increasing trend towards polydrug use, involving a combination of alcohol, illicit drugs and prescription medication, is a major concern for me and the Government. Our treatment services are also seeing an increase in the use of benzodiazepine and z-drug. The fact that this often occurs in the context of multiple substance use is a particularly worrying trend.  Unfortunately, because of the hidden nature of heroin use, we do not have good data on its usage in Ireland. We know that there are in the region of 9,800 people in methadone maintenance treatment, which is an indicator of the extent of the problem. The NACDA is currently undertaking a survey, which will provide us with an up to date estimate of heroin users later this year. Even without this data, I am satisfied that heroin represents a substantial element of our drug problem and I am determined to find the most effective way to tackle this blight on communities.  I have already highlighted the multi-sectoral nature of our response to the drug problem. I would like to pay tribute to An Garda Síochána and the customs service for their role in the significant drug seizures that we have seen in recent years. The continued disruption of the supply of illicit drugs remains a key priority and this is also reflected in An Garda Síochána's policing plan for 2015. The emergence of new psychoactive substances, specifically designed to circumvent drug controls, has been a matter of particular concern in recent years both in Ireland and at international level. The Misuse of Drugs Regulations and the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 have had a significant effect in closing head shops and reducing the supply of the substances. Recent research conducted by Trinity College shows a significant fall in recent and problematic use of head shop drugs among young people, following the national ban that was introduced in 2010, a measure which had cross-party support.  I met the UK Minister for Policing, Crime, Criminal Justice and Victims, Mr. Mike Penning, during the British-Irish Council summit meeting in June. He was keen to discuss with us the practical impact of banning so-called legal highs, as the UK Government has introduced a Psychoactive Substances Bill, currently going through its Parliament, which is modelled on the Irish experience.  The problem of new psychoactive substances is a constantly changing phenomenon. New substances are emerging all the time. We continue to monitor the problem through our national early warning system which enables authorities to identify new drugs, describe new trends in use and report the serious and unusual consequences of drug use. I view it as vitally important to continue to highlight the potential dangers associated with taking illegal drugs. Evidence-based awareness raising and prevention programmes also play a key role in promoting healthier lifestyles and changing attitudes. Education programmes, such as the SPHE, facilities and services for young people in disadvantaged areas and diversionary programmes for young people at risk, all help to equip young people to make more positive lifestyle choices. However, the drug problem is a wider societal issue and cannot just be addressed within the educational system. As I often say, children and young people do not live in schools. Parental involvement and community concern play a role in protecting young people against substance misuse. Young people have been handed this problem by a previous generation and we should resist the temptation to blame such young victims who are merely continuing and mirroring what their parents and grandparents practised.  I am delighted to confirm that funding of €1 million will be allocated from the Dormant Accounts Fund later this year for substance misuse prevention. Grants of between €30,000 and €50,000 will be available for proposals developed by drug and alcohol task forces to mobilise communities to tackle drug and alcohol-related issues. As I mentioned earlier, approximately 9,800 people are currently availing of opioid substitution treatment. The number of new entrants to treatment whose main problem drug is heroin is in decline. However, services are seeing an increase in the number of people whose main problem drug is cannabis, as well an increasing incidence of poly-drug use. The HSE is committed to achieving improved health outcomes for problem drug users and has reoriented its services in recent years to cater for those with poly-drug use issues. Waiting times for access to services, particularly outside Dublin, have been considerably reduced. The latest figures indicate that in the region of 95% of clients over 18 are accessing treatment within one calendar month of assessment, while almost 100% of under-18s are accessing treatment within a week. Additional funding of €2.1 million has been provided in the HSE budget for 2015 for measures targeting vulnerable drug users, bringing the total allocation for addiction services to almost €109 million. The extra funding includes support for an additional 53 beds, creating 439 new treatments. The Government has also stepped up the effort to reduce drug-related deaths. In 2012, there were 633 drug-related deaths in Ireland. While there has been a small decline in the overall number compared to 2011, drug-related deaths remain at an unacceptable level, and every death is a tragedy in its own right.  I especially welcome the HSE-led pilot project on naloxone which has been launched recently. Naloxone is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs such as heroin, morphine and methadone upon overdose. This innovative project involves training lay persons, such as the family and friends of a drug user, in administering the naloxone injection to overdose victims. Research shows that providing increased access to naloxone for people likely to witness an overdose is an effective way of reducing overdose deaths. I have no doubt that lives can be saved as a result of this initiative. We have an overdose problem in Ireland. I think we have the third worst rate of overdose in Europe. There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere, which is unhygienic and unsafe for both drug users and the general public. Medically supervised injecting facilities exist in a number of other countries, and have been suggested as a response to the problem of street injecting in this country. I have recently received a draft legislative proposal in relation to this matter, and I have asked my officials to examine the issues in more detail. Those struggling with drug problems are often the most marginalised in our society. They may have multiple, complex, interlocking needs, such as poverty, housing, poor health and education. This underlines the importance of services working together, through a client-centred approach, to foster client progression. The Government is committed to the full implementation of the national drugs rehabilitation framework, which aims to ensure continuity of care for the recovering drug user through shared care planning. I would like to outline for committee members my priorities for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government. The first relates to the Misuse of Drugs Acts. In March of this year, the Minister for Health brought forward emergency legislation to deal with an adverse Court of Appeal decision regarding the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The ruling had the effect of decontrolling all substances that had been controlled by Government order, including ecstasy, new psychoactive substances and benzodiazepines. This meant that it was no longer an offence to possess these substances. The Oireachtas passed emergency legislation on 11 March to restore the controls on such substances by placing these in the Schedule to the Act. I intend to bring forward another Bill by the end of the year to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled, thereby meeting our EU and international obligations to control substances that are dangerous and have the potential for abuse. The Bill will clarify the provisions under which Ministerial orders and regulations are made. This will once again allow regulations to be made and, if necessary and appropriate, allow the introduction of stricter or less strict controls on substances that are already covered under the legislation. Second, as Minister with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I will be leading the development of the drugs strategy for the period after 2016. My intention over the coming months is to lay the groundwork for a concise and focused policy, placing a clear emphasis on the practical implementation of actions. An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will also help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches which might be considered in an Irish context. The development of the new strategy gives us the opportunity to have a constructive and wide-ranging public dialogue on our current drug policies so that we are in a strong position to develop a fit-for-purpose response to the drug problem which will meet challenges into the future. I will endeavour to answer any questions that members of the joint committee may have.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«How long do I have to respond?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A wide range of issues have been raised and I appreciate the contributions that have been made. Deputy Ó Caoláin raised the issue of psychoactive substances and the effectiveness of the 2010 legislation.We have a cultural problem with addiction in Ireland. Every family in Ireland has an addiction problem. It is in every corner of the country. There is a traditional misconception that it affects only certain geographical areas of Dublin. That is not true. It is everywhere, in every class group, every income level and every part of the country. People in a higher income bracket tend to be able to hide it better. Those in a lower income bracket cannot hide it as easily. In 2010, there was a cultural shift in that not only do we have a cultural acceptance of misuse of alcohol, which is a dangerous cultural problem, but we also have a cultural problem with our view of cannabis in certain sections of society. Head shops were prevalent in 2010 and schoolchildren in uniform were lining up outside head shops where they could legally purchase substances which were very dangerous. We had crossed a cultural border in the acceptance of that type of activity. The legislation introduced in 2010 was effective in closing down the head shops. There have been 260 controlled substances since then. I agree with Deputy Healy that we are constantly trying to catch up with a very sophisticated and lucrative market because it is only necessary to change one small component of a substance and re-package it. The system is trying to catch up with it. I attended an interesting presentation during the week by a member of An Garda Síochána at the north inner city drugs task force who said he has had conversations with women in his area who ask him how can they tell their children to get a poorly paid job in a department store if they have the option of earning €1,000 per week selling zoplicone on the corner of their street. The vehicle to address this is the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015 that will come before the House this year. I agree about the challenge in doing that.  I accept that we have challenges in the area of treatment. I am trying to be as open as possible to meeting groups and drugs task forces and those who meet service users and people in recovery and have identified several gaps. One gap appears to be between the moment of realisation for a person with a substance abuse problem and the moment when treatment kicks in. There is an expectation that the person’s behaviour or substance intake will change before the person can enter a mainstream programme. There are varying degrees of agreement or disagreement as to whether that really is a gap. We have to identify how we interact with an individual who, for the first time, has had that light bulb moment that life cannot continue in this manner and that he or she needs assistance. Crossing the threshold of a centre involves making a major personal change and calling out for help has a massive effect on self-esteem. Are we engaging with those people effectively and practically at that moment? I am not sure we are. There is also an aftercare issue. Are we just putting those on methadone programmes into cold storage for ten or 20 years, or do we deal with them as people with massive potential, who can work through their recovery and play a significant and important role in society? We have a cultural problem in how we view people in recovery. It is not edifying to call them by nicknames, which we do. We have to challenge and move beyond that behaviour. They are sometimes very poorly treated by the media and in political circles and we have to move beyond that type of victim blaming. Anyone else with a medical problem would not be treated in such a manner and it does really inhibit them and their potential to recover.  I agree completely with Deputy Healy about the national drugs strategy and inclusive consultation because there are many people with much to say and the nature of the drug problem has changed completely since 2009. We are working with a strategy developed for 2009 to 2016. Ireland was a completely different place in 2009 and the drug issue was completely different then, as is the nature of what young people do now. I do not want to focus only on young people because people of all ages take illegal substances but young people engage in poly drug use, taking benzodiazepines mixed with alcohol and cannabis, which is much more potent and dangerous than it may have been ten years ago. It is a massive problem. I met a man aged 21 in a detox centre in Fingal last month who had been addicted to cannabis for nine years. This weighs heavily on my thoughts when trying to come up with a new drug strategy. I am not convinced we need a seven year one; we need a tighter one, a more focused number of years when we can make a difference through what we are trying to do. I take on board Deputy Healy’s comments about policing. I intend to hold a conference on 29 July in the Mansion House in order to bring as many stakeholders as possible into one room at the one time. I cannot wait for a review of the national drugs strategy to put a proper political focus on the nature of the problem in Ireland, which is a very serious one. What I hear in different parts of the country terrifies me about the nature, prevalence and danger of drug use because we are not giving it the attention it needs. I intend to bring a paper to Cabinet as soon as I possibly can and not to wait for the review of the national drugs strategy to do so. I will do that most likely in the autumn. This committee can certainly help me in that process. On 29 July, in conjunction with the new Ardmhéara of Dublin City, Councillor Críona Ní Dhálaigh, I want to host a conference and start that thought process about how to feed into the snapshot of the nature of the drug problem in Ireland.  Although Senator Bacik had to leave to vote in the Seanad, I will deal with her issue about the Portuguese approach. I do not see any point in persisting with dealing with people who are caught in a possession of a substance for personal use through the criminal justice system. It is a complete waste of Garda time and of the system. Under the Portuguese model there is an intervention, there can be sanctions but it is a waste of everybody’s time and efforts to approach a person with an addiction issue who has a substance for personal use and decide that person is a criminal. That person has a medical need and should be dealt with in that manner. We have a lot of hearts and minds to win on that. The committees’ consultation process is very useful because as soon as the word decriminalisation is used, people think one is talking about legalisation. They are two very different things. Our terminology has to be carefully used and sculpted. We have to use international models. The value system and dynamic in every country is different. A legislative approach cannot be taken from one country, stuck into another and expected to work. When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality held discussions on prostitution, it was told not to take the Swedish approach without taking its value system of counselling and education, and the entire package. If we were to go down the Portuguese route, it could not be only a legislative change; it would have to be an entire package of measures. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank members for their contributions. I agree with Senator John Crown's sentiments about it not being enough to continue on with what has been handed down to us but that we must instead form a logical view of what is happening and what needs to be done. As I said earlier, there is no point in clogging up the courts system and criminalising people for what is a medical need. There can be a lot of tough talk around this issue, which is really pointless. We have an understanding of the issues facing people who live on the edges of society and the excesses that can sometimes arise in their behaviour. Tough talk offers great one liners for journalists to latch onto but essentially amounts to meaningless and vacuous commentary which does not address the reality of the situation. Continuing down the road of the Just Say No policy is a waste of time because a lot of young people do not listen to that message. Some are affected by the call and respond accordingly, but many others do not. I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that the education component is very important in terms of setting out our stall, but it is not really the most effective way of reaching young people. If children were influenced to that extent by everything they are told in school, we would not have the issues we have. I am instinctively an advocate for the idea of medically supervised consumption rooms. I am in favour, too, of a decriminalisation model, but it must be one that suits the Irish context. That is a crucial point. I referred to the different legislative approaches taken in different countries. We must ensure any provisions we bring in will work in this country and in the context of Irish dynamics. There is a huge amount of work to do in terms of raising public awareness. Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned the 633 people who died from drug misuse in 2012. It is an appalling statistic. If it applied to road deaths, there would be a massive public awareness programme arising out of it. We need to look at how to hone our message, but there remains work to do on what that message should be. This is an issue that impacts people of all ages, young, middle-aged and older. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made an interesting point about age being a factor in decisions around criminal sanctions. Some people have taken drugs all their lives and do not make a connection in their own heads with the tragic stories that enter the public realm from time to time.Consequently, I do not know; I am willing to listen and learn as to how best to approach this matter. I accept the Deputy's point about how the Government is constantly trying to catch up with a lucrative and sophisticated industry. The Deputy and I are aware, from the area she represents and which I used to represent and in which I used to teach, that this is an extremely lucrative industry. It is not a casual, recreational activity in which people get involved but is a parallel economy. It employs people, one can make money out of it, people derive power from it and it has a hierarchy within it. Why would one spend one's time in education or further training when is a lot of money to be made within this parallel economy? As there is a huge amount of empowerment to be gained from doing that, the question is how should that also be tackled. I acknowledge the Deputy mentioned that the previous Minister held a conference in early 2014 and I understand the focus was mainly on the issue of alcohol. My intention is not to allow this conference, which is to be held at the end of the month, to feed into the national drugs strategy necessarily but to let it feed into a paper I wish to present to Cabinet, which basically will outline Ireland's current position in this regard. As for waiting for the national drugs strategy, such a strategy will be produced anyway. Governments and the political system will deliver that anyway. However, I wish to provide a snapshot in time of the nature of our drug problem, how important it is, how dangerous it is, and how serious this is. I want people to say things like people are not showing up, to refer to the drugs task forces, the gaps in the service, the aftercare and all the rest of it. I believe we can get to the bottom of these issues at the conference at the end of the month.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Prior to the court case earlier this year, the Minister had the power to control substances. It was the court case that caused the confusion and the emergency legislation and that is why we are in this position. If I might suggest, the pre-legislative stage in this committee or committees would be key to teasing out those issues, be it the justice committee, the health committee or whichever committee is deemed appropriate. Collectively, across the House, there is a determination to deal with and nail this issue and to be on top of it. I completely accept the point made by the Deputy that when one is dealing with a highly sophisticated industry, which can change a small component of whatever substance it is and then repackage, reproduce and distribute it, one is constantly playing catch-up. The Government wishes to have as robust a legislative framework as possible to deal with that. My understanding of the 2010 legislation is that psychoactive substances effectively were banned and that there is a list of those which were not in order to give a legal structure around it. I suggest the pre-legislative stage here at this committee or in joint sittings of committees might be the best way to tease that out. However, on the Deputy's question, I certainly have an open mind as to how best we can deal with the issues he has raised. One of the Deputy's questions pertained to the issue of mental health and addiction and a new strategy. That absolutely will be a central part of the new strategy and I believe it is key to it. Earlier, I mentioned the interaction I have had with people, including those in recovery and their families and the trauma their families have also gone through sometimes is overlooked. As I mentioned at the outset of my presentation, I believe it should be acknowledged that every family in Ireland has had an addiction problem. Therefore, every family has suffered from it, every family understands it and every family needs to be helped through that process too, because it is not just the person in recovery who needs assistance; it also is the people who care for the person in recovery.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and Ministers of State for their attendance.  Will the Minister comment on attempts to combat the black economy and the effect of the black economy on compliant small-time builders and tradespeople?  With regard to last week's judgment on JLCs, will the Minister comment on his contact with the social partners?  Has contact intensified as a result of the judgment?  The impact of large multiples on the outskirts of towns has been raised.  Will the Minister also comment on the groceries order and the impact of below-cost selling of alcohol on small-scale off-licences?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My point is that the abolition of the groceries order is being used to drive come people out of business.  Has the Minister considered investigating this issue?  I used the sale of alcohol as an example.  It is not the issue itself.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Apologies have been received from Deputy Brendan Griffin.  The Chairman will be back in the hot seat in an hour.The joint committee went into private session at 9.30 a.m. and resumed in public session at 9.35 a.m.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We are here to discuss the proposed rationalisation of the VECs and agencies under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.  I welcome Mr. Martin Hanevy, assistant secretary general, Mr. Dalton Tattan, principal officer, and Mr. Matthew Ryan, principal officer of the Department of Education and Skills.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I now call on Mr. Hanevy to begin the briefing on the rationalisation proposals.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank our guests for their presentation.  It was stated that 23,000 jobs were created last year.  What type of jobs were created and what skill sets do those who obtained them possess?  How sustainable are these jobs?  Will our guests comment on the geographical spread in respect of the jobs in question?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for the presentation, which I read earlier.  I apologise for being late.  I have a simple question regarding policies and procedures.  The witnesses touched on some of the issues regarding skill sets, and it has been mentioned that it is a great new opportunity with the new agency being set up to replace FÁS.  My understanding is that FÁS as it is currently does not have an adult literacy policy, for example.  When almost 23% of the adult population are functionally illiterate, with a high level of those early school leavers or people involved in the construction industry trying to upskill, not having an adult literacy strategy within FÁS seems to be strange, at best, or completely irresponsible at worst.Can we be absolutely sure that the new agency and agencies dealing with adult education or further retraining will have a component to ensure literacy standards of those who are coming under the new agency's umbrella will be addressed?  Will there be knowledge as to where such people stand in the world?  If a person does not have the fundamental ability to read, the chances of maximising employment potential is fairly low.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My point is whether it is a matter of policy or is it just an action the FÁS personnel would carry out?  I would rather have it as a matter of policy than depend on the goodwill of those working in FÁS.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does Mr. Mulligan agree that it should be done as a matter of policy?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegates for their presentation.  I will make three quick comments, one on the community primary school, one on the literacy strategy and one on the overall structure.When I listened to Deputy Conaghan talking about the waning influence of the Catholic Church on education, I was reminded of a phrase uttered by someone else in a different context: "They haven't gone away, you know."  I was going to ask the delegates for their views on the VECs' involvement at community national school level, but as they have already answered the question, I will not pursue it.I appreciate the comments the delegates made on the literacy strategy.  They pre-empted some of what I was going to say.  They had obviously listened to my comments and questions to the previous panel.  I understand absolutely what the VECs are doing on literacy.  Many VECs, including the one in Dublin, which I represent, are located in areas of social disadvantage with high levels of adult illiteracy.  My point is that we need a policy framework to be embedded in every education institution in order that when we deal with adults, parents and the community at large, there is an understanding of the levels of illiteracy.  We need to work beyond the current frameworks.  At primary level, there are five policies that every primary school has to have, but a literacy policy is not one of them.  I am not talking about a subject on the curriculum but about the way in which a school engages with the wider community.  There should be a policy framework in place for this.The third item I want to mention is the overall structure of the VECs and political involvement.  I make this point with the greatest respect to the president.  I am on the board of management of a VEC, not as a councillor, which I was in my previous political existence, but as the principal of a primary school, and the structure strikes me as a little odd.  Will the delegates comment on the level of political involvement by councillors and the fact that they are, in effect, the chairpersons of the boards of management?  Does this structure offer the best way forward and is this the way it should be from now on?  Does it need examination?  Is there a danger of conflicts of interest all over the place?  Various health boards were dismantled or changed as a result of accusations of local political interference.  I am not suggesting anyone on a board anywhere in the country is doing this, but I have questions on the issue.  If a chairperson is trying to drive a board of management and maximise the education potential of the student body, should they be unconcerned with matters political?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Not at all.  I did not mean any disrespect to anyone.  I asked the question to see what the reaction would be.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The minutes of a meeting held on 22 September have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the following from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland: Mr. Gerard P. Kilcommins, president; Ms Joanne Richardson, CEO; Mr. Brian Harrison, research and communications executive; and Mr. Brian Cotter, commercial and public affairs director.  I also welcome Mr. Joseph P. Quinlan, author of an American Chamber of Commerce report on US foreign direct investment into Ireland.Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We will have a presentation from the Department of Education and Skills but the Deputy has ensured a spot on the news tonight.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Finally, I call on Deputy Tóibín.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their positive contributions, for coming here today and outlining the importance of the USA to this country in economic terms, as the report demonstrates.  We are all enjoying the robust Republican debates late night on Fox News.  They keep me entertained if nothing else.  The strong trading links between both countries are very positive at this point in time and augur well for the future rebuilding of the Irish economy.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The next item is a briefing by officials from the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills on proposals to ensure that there is a better skills match between industry needs and third level graduates and to develop enterprise education in Irish secondary schools and business innovation in third level institutions.I welcome the following: Mr. Kevin McCarthy, assistant secretary; Ms Anne Forde, principal officer, higher education and policy section; and Ms Margaret Kelly, principal officer, qualifications, curriculum and assessment policy section of the Department of Education and Skills.  I also welcome Mr. Pat Nolan, principal officer, science and technology policy unit; Mr. Eamon McHale, principal officer, local enterprise section; Mr. Gary Dixon, assistant principal officer, industrial relations unit; and all the officials of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank Mr. McCarthy for the presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Do any of the officials wish to respond?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will call the next speakers and the officials might respond to their contributions.  I will call Deputy Conaghan followed by Senator O'Donnell and Deputy Lawlor.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Senator, this is not necessarily a suitable topic for this meeting.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The witnesses may not be in a position to answer it.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The validity of the question is not at issue.  It is simply that it is not relevant to the topic under discussion at this meeting.  We can discuss at another time.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Officials are not in a position to comment on Government policy.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to comment on the contributions that have been made.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We appear to have gotten a lot of secondary school teachers out of the last general election.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Nothing will have a larger impact in a classroom than an excellent teacher.  Giving a teacher the opportunity to acquire such skill sets is difficult.  There is a heavy emphasis on teaching maths, science and technology subjects.  A Teaching Council report on one primary school training college, however, noted the time allocated for religion in the college was four times that for science.  Is the delegation concerned about this finding?  Have the teacher training colleges adequate resources to impart balanced skill sets to teachers?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Perhaps the officials will respond to the questions that have been raised?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I asked about training colleges and the imbalance.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank the officials for briefing the committee on a fundamentally important issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their interesting presentations.  The points system is horrendous, as it kills creativity, abolishes all need for independent thought and has created a scenario in second level schools whereby people scramble around for the requisite points to enter into whatever third level courses they want.  Students are pressured by parents and teachers to get grinds, eat up notes and spit them out onto a page.  However, the system is fair, transparent and trusted.  In a country like Ireland where there is a whiff of corruption around pretty much everything, it is nice to know that we have a system in which people have faith.  The 1999 points commission was referred to, but it did not devise an option that was viable at the time.  If we are to change the system, can we be sure that people's faith in it will be retained?  Will the witnesses expand on the suggestion that, in terms of literacy and numeracy, English and mathematics should be mandatory for the calculation of points and qualification for third level?Professor Scott asked about ICT in third level.  I would be interested in hearing more on this matter, as I have strong opinions on the level of technology and science tuition in primary school teaching colleges.  That level may have changed since I attended college, but not radically so.  Heavy emphasis is placed on Irish and religion much to the detriment of English and science.  Will the witnesses comment on this matter?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is this a result of having single gender schools?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The words "social welfare" and "fraud" tend to be linked in the common consciousness.  There is any amount of fraud throughout society, however, including tax evasion.  It should not be automatically assumed, therefore, that there is widespread fraudulent behaviour among social welfare recipients.The Department stated there was an increase in claimants for the back to school allowance this year.  Can the witnesses give an exact figure for this?  Are the parents of two and three year old children eligible for the allowance?  If so, how much is this costing?  It does seem somewhat strange considering two and three year olds do not attend primary school.Regarding the tackling of welfare fraud in other industries, the committee met recently with representatives from the taxi industry.  They pointed out how checkpoints targeting the social welfare status of taxi drivers were set up by the Department and the Garda several weeks ago.  These were well received and the word went around, making it easier for full-time taxi drivers to ply their trade.  Are there any plans to extend such checkpoints to ensure full-time taxi drivers are the main beneficiaries of the trade and not those engaged in fraudulent behaviour?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Mr. Mulkerrins and his committee for the presentation.  I am reminded of a comment made by the Minister for Justice and Equality at the UN to the effect that Ireland may move to having a special ethnic designation for Travellers.  I wonder if this will have an impact on the education system and the provision of education for Travellers.The delegates indicated that the National Educational Welfare Board has come under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  What is their view on the fact that there is currently no requirement on parents to send their children to school until they are six years of age?  As such, there is little the board can do in respect of enforcing attendance for four and five years olds.I am a long-time critic of the general allocation model to the extent that it favours larger schools over smaller schools.  For example, a child attending a small, disadvantaged school who is in the 40th or 50th percentile for reading - 30% of children are below that level - will not be entitled to resource hours, while the same child, if he or she is enrolled in a larger, middle-class school, will receive that benefit.  There is an inequality built into the system which does not target the areas of greatest need.  I understand a review of the general allocation model is ongoing, but I ask the delegates to comment on this aspect.In regard to special needs assistants, will the delegates comment on the availability of private psychological assessments to some schools?  I do not wish to cast aspersions on the professionalism of educational psychologists, but it has been proven that schools which are totally dependent on the National Educational Psychological Service receive a lesser allocation of resources compared with those which can avail of private psychological assessments.  Will the delegates comment on that?Do the delegates have a figure for expenditure on taxi transport for pupils with special educational needs?  If they do not, I will submit a parliamentary question seeking that information.On admission policies under the general allocation model, will the delegates comment on the policies of certain schools which restrict access for children with special educational needs?  The reality is that some schools have a high proportion of such children, because they do not practise restrictive access policies, while others have a disproportionately low cohort of such students as a consequence of their restrictive policies.  What can be done to equalise the system so that every school in receipt of State moneys takes its fair share of children who require additional supports?In regard to low or high-incidence designations and so on, is it possible for the Department to consider a separate designation entirely for Down's syndrome children and their particular special educational needs?  What is the likelihood of thinking outside the box in that regard?  I have asked a great number of specific questions and I look forward to the replies.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«To clarify, the general allocation model benefits children attending larger schools.  This means that a child who is in the 40th percentile for reading and who is attending a small school with a high percentage of children with special educational needs will not receive the resources available to his or her counterpart attending a larger school where there is not the same level of special educational need.  In other words, where there are two children with the same level of educational disadvantage, the child attending a larger school will benefit from resource services simply because the allocation is done in terms of enrolment, while the child attending a smaller school will miss out.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is fine.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will call Deputy Seán Crowe, Senator John Kelly and Deputy Michael Conaghan.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We may have to suspend the sitting for a few minutes because a vote has been called in the Dáil Chamber.  It has been suggested to me that at our next meeting we discuss in private session the possibility of a delegation approaching the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Social Protection.  Is it agreed to discuss that suggestion at the next meeting of the joint committee?  It is a good suggestion.  Perhaps we will suspend the sitting now to allow members to vote in the Chamber.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Okay.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am conscious of time pressures.  I ask the delegation to wait until Deputies return from the Dáil before giving further answers.  We will suspend the sitting briefly to accommodate Deputies' participation in the division.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Mr. Finlay and Ms Tinsley for their presentation.  I read their interesting presentation and fully agree with much of what they have said.  I am a great believer that poverty is a thief and education is the great liberator.  I will make a few comments on which I seek the perspective of our guests.On the literacy strategy, which is welcome, I accept the criticism that it does not sufficiently target or engage parents.  We should work towards the development of an adult literacy policy that encompasses every strand of the education system.  It was interesting to learn during our meeting with representatives of FÁS that, despite working with many young people who have literacy problems, the organisation does not have an adult literacy strategy.  The five policies which every primary school must have in place do not include an adult literacy strategy.  If primary schools were required to have a policy on engaging with the parent body and wider community, it could be judged, inspected and updated.  Unfortunately, they are not required to have such a policy in place.  Will Mr. Finlay and Ms Tinsley comment on that proposal?I agree with the comments made about Mountjoy Prison.  I visited the prison last week and literacy levels in it are extremely low.  Whereas 35% of the prison population is actively engaged in educational programmes, an already low figure, the figure in Mountjoy Prison is only 15%.On the programmes operated by Barnardos, educational support should commence nine months before birth, as it were.  I concur with the comments on the issue of pre-school education.  My experience as a school principal in a disadvantaged area is that from the moment one meets four year old children one can identify which of them will have challenges and which of them will not.  This can be done on the basis of their demeanour, whether they have been fed and are rested and how well they are presented.  A number of reports have shown that when compared to a child from a more affluent area with a less challenging background, a four year old child in a disadvantaged school who comes from a challenging background will start school with a gap to make up.  This essential gap, which is clear at the age of four years, will remain even though the progress of the children in question through the education system may be the same.  There is, therefore, a combination of what happens in the education system and what happened before the child entered mainstream education.The Young Ballymun organisation had a conference recently which showed that the problem with our education system, as currently structured, is that there is a direct contradiction, if one likes, between the amount of funding we put into pre-school education versus the impact it has.  We must address the anomaly whereby most funding is allocated to educational programmes in later years where it has little impact.  The comments of the representatives on that issue would be appreciated.What is the balance of support versus empowerment?  I agree with the comments on children going to school hungry.  Our school and other schools and principals with whom I have discussed the issue say they provide a homework club and a breakfast club but there must be a mechanism within this to empower parents at some stage to take on that responsibility.  Where is the balance between empowering the parents to do it and a child going to school hungry?  It should be easy to ascertain.In some isolated circumstances there may be a family who say the children get their breakfast in school and they do their homework in school.  Surely the best outcome would be that a parent would be empowered to deliver those services in their own home.  How does one strike that balance when the alternative is to leave a child potentially hungry or without homework provision?In regard to educational supports, a delegation on special education needs appeared before the committee recently and said it did not accept my criticism about the general allocation model which I have always considered benefits richer schools rather than smaller schools.  Nor did it accept my criticism about SNAs and the fact that those schools who have access to private psychological reports tend to get a larger allocation of SNAs.In respect of the National Educational Welfare Board, the position of four and five year old children who are absent from school is being reviewed.  That a ten year old child who has missed 50 days gets more attention from the NEWB and the education welfare officer than a four year old child who has missed 100 days is incredible.  However, that is the system as of now and it has to change.  If a child is within the education system, the carrot and stick must follow him or her.I tabled a parliamentary question recently on the back to school allowance.  Given the anomaly in the system whereby €7.96 million is spent on two and three year olds who are not attending school, is it correct that we would have a back-to-school allowance for those children?  Could the fund be better targeted and, perhaps, administered through schools?  Would the representatives welcome the school administering such a support?On the question of preschool, particularly in disadvantaged communities, the issue is the balance between empowerment and support.  Many young parents who are engaged in helping preschool community-based initiatives are well-meaning and do their best but are not equipped to target the fundamental literacy and educational issues that are required in those circumstances.  Many of those involved are CE participants.  Again, it is the balance between empowering young parents who may never have been involved in formal employment and are now involved in an educational setting but do not have the essential skills to benefit the child.  In many of these circumstances, the balance between what benefits the child and what benefits the worker has gone the wrong way.

AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Deputy Lyons, in fairness to everyone, I asked all members to be as brief as possible.  I am conscious there is a Dáil na nÓg delegation which is waiting patiently to make a presentation on this very issue of the junior certificate cycle.  It is unfair to go beyond what is reasonable.  The Deputy has asked reasonable questions and it is only fair to allow the officials to respond to those questions.  In fairness to everyone, I do not appreciate being talked over in that manner.  I ask Mr. Hammond to respond.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«On behalf on the committee, I thank the NCCA representatives for attending and engaging in such a worthwhile discussion on a topic affecting so many young people.  I hope we will have further discussions on other aspects to the satisfaction of all Deputies.The committee went into private session at 3.31 p.m. and resumed in public session at 3.33 p.m.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Mr. Luke McTernan, Ms Lisa Murray Sheehy, Mr. Tiarnan Fallon Verbruggen, Mr. Leo Cauneen and Mr. Tom Leahy, who are all Dáil na nÓg council members.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Does Deputy Conaghan care to regale us with his Latin days?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«While schools are tasked with teaching subjects and moulding people into good citizens, parents also have a role to play in empowering their children.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the committee I thank the officials from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for remaining to hear the delegation's presentation.  This is how seriously they take the presentation.  I agree with Deputy Lyons and other speakers that it is one of the best presentations we have heard.I am very much taken with the discussion about body image and the mental health issues attached to it, and the recommendation to enforce the law that all altered advertising images should indicate they have been altered by means of a symbol and text.  This is a practical measure we can follow up.  We have to take to task the advertising industry on many of the images being promoted.I spent 11 years teaching.  We are going through very difficult times, things are very tough and they will be pretty tough for a long time.  Sometimes one can dip into despair but what always cheered me up was being around young people and I have missed that terribly since I got this new job.  Listening to the representatives today has given me a new sense of hope about what our country will be like in years to come.  If these young people are an example of what we have coming next, then we do not have anything to worry about.  Their points about the junior certificate were well made and will be taken with the respect they deserve.  I definitely think the campaigning they are doing on mental health is absolutely crucial.  This should be the start of a long conversation between this committee and the Dáil na nÓg council.  We can work together on many of the points that have been made, not just now but over a period of time.I thank the witnesses for attending before the committee.  Did they get a day off school to come here?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Fair enough.  That is very important.  We should put it on the record that nobody missed school in order to be here today.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  It states:Under the Treaties governing the European Union, Member States have full responsibility for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity.Does a conflict arise between our education system and EU equality legislation or frameworks?  I refer specifically to section 37 of the Equality Act which provides for the promotion of a religious ethos in schools and which impacts on admissions policies and the rights of gay teachers.I refer to the Council resolution on the renewed European agenda for adult learning.  Our provision of second-chance education lacks a formalised adult literacy policy.  It is one thing to have a curriculum but it is another matter to have an adult literacy policy embedded in the system for second-chance students with a low level of literacy.  The body previously known as FÁS did not have such a policy.  I hope SOLAS will have policies to deal with early school leavers or second-chance education participants.I am interested in the modernisation of higher education and the U-Multirank development.  What are the criteria for these rankings?  I refer to the Minister of State's comments on European languages.  Will he agree that the level of knowledge of modern European languages is deficient?  Is there scope in the proposals for a new junior certificate curriculum for more emphasis on oral language acquisition?  One oral examination at the end of a period of learning a language, be it Irish or a European language, often in the leaving certificate year, is not sufficient.  I suggest an oral examination at junior certificate level as a means of promoting the proficiency in a modern European language.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Riordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Dr. Healy and his team for their presentation.  We have discussed these issues previously.  We do not live in a high tax country, which is the message that must go out.  Page 3 of the presentation shows a table of the effect of taxation rates in Ireland.  I am not necessarily advocating that in current circumstances there should be a huge hike in tax rates but the value judgment of society during the past 14 years has been that with money in one's pocket one could pay for private education and grinds for one's children, purchase a car rather than take public transport and rather than depend on the public health care system could sign up to a private health care plan.  I am an advocate of a more fair, equitable and progressive system which would allow for all those things to be free.  As a society we need to discuss this issue.  I was interested to hear Dr. Healy's remarks in regard to a ten year discussion about Irish society.  The best we can come up with now, in terms of ambition for Ireland, is a return to the bond markets.  That is what all this pain is for, which is a pretty raw and uninspiring ambition for families experiencing tough times.Dr. Healy mentioned the six ways the previous budget hit the poor particularly badly, one of which is no longer in existence.  Which was the most difficult?  I assume it was the universal social charge.  Many kites have been flown in the past few weeks - playing with people's emotions - to the effect that the universal social charge will be tweaked or changed to take the pressure off the lower paid.  Perhaps Dr. Healy will give us his views on that.My final question is in many ways cruel and unfair in that it asks the delegates to differentiate between those on social welfare and the working poor, which differentiation should not be made.  Are the people most at risk of poverty those on social welfare who have a level of protection in terms of medical cards and so on or those who find themselves in the bracket of the working poor where the level of debt is unsustainable?  The latter may perhaps be people who purchased their council houses in recent years and whose incomes have dropped significantly since then.  I am interested in hearing the delegates views on that issue.On vouchers, I have a problem with the type of narrative which comes from the point of view of benefiting the child.  So many families are struggling and should not be tarred with the same brush as the small minority who cannot cope for various reasons and dysfunction in their homes.  To offer a family doing its best for its children a new voucher system would be the final insult.  I would welcome the delegates' comments on those issues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We might be better off not knowing.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sorry I missed the presentation but I am familiar with the document.  The issue with Hibernia College and others is that there is a flooding of teachers into the system at a time when positions are few and far between.  Further to Deputy Conaghan's point, my experience of teacher training colleges is that they are already slightly removed from the wider university system.  Teachers are training in a very isolated situation and in the modern day it is not really realistic that they are not mixing with students in other disciplines, which is not a good policy for those who will be educating people in the classroom.  A college such as Hibernia College removes them even more given that they are effectively being trained from behind a computer screen.  Have departmental officials taken that into account?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the literacy question, I am encouraged by the Minister's presentation.  An education psychologist based in West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow speaks about the total eradication of illiteracy.  Unfortunately, in Ireland we only speak about tacking illiteracy and, therefore, what the Minister is doing is encouraging.  The statistics for adult illiteracy are stark, showing 24% in that category; often that is assumed to be an elderly population but that is not so.  We have spoken previously about the importance of adult literacy policies throughout the education system and in every training board and educational outlet.A recent presentation from NALA outlined to us how FÁS, in its previous existence, had not had an adult literacy policy which seems to be a huge omission.  I am delighted to note that what the Minister is proposing will address that issue.  I would hope, in time, that this policy driven approach would percolate right down through the education system in order that anybody who comes in contact with anybody in the education system or retraining would have a high level of literacy component to it.  Literacy has to be tackled at both ends.  It cannot be focused solely on the child but on his or her family.  A literacy issue in the home has long lasting effects.  Is that something that should happen over a period, given that literacy is a foremost component of training and retraining in our education institutions?  Should checks balances be in place to assess how the policies have worked?   Adult literary is difficult to gauge.  It is positive that more people are engaging in adult literacy programmes, but it can be difficult for a person to admit to literacy problems as it is easy to hide them.  Over a period, will it be possible to assess whether we have been successful in tackling this most debilitating of educational disadvantage issues?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not know if I am permitted to give a list of schools which are thankful for the Minister's announcement re DEIS.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is refreshing, given that cuts in previous Administrations are not up for discussion, that we have a new way of dealing with situations.  On the issue of the 70,000 new students within the system, how does the Minister envisage the system absorbing such a large intake right across the board?  I refer to the issue of guidance counsellors and chaplains for which there is an allocation of €9 million as stated in a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled.  As Deputy Anthony Lawlor has indicated, there is an issue about the deeds of trust within community and comprehensive schools.  How does the Minister feel that could be unpicked or is it a necessity that we would unpick it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Any cut in the education budget will hurt.  The constraint under which we operate is that 77% of the education budget - pay and pensions - is protected under the Croke Park agreement, and I support this agreement.  If class sizes are to be protected, it is a case of how to make other savings.  Anything that is touched will be difficult.  I met a number of guidance counsellors and have tried to identify alternative funding for the €9 million spent on chaplains.  In DEIS schools, there has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 18.25.  However, some DEIS schools say they will not be able to absorb the change in the guidance counselling system with that reduction.  Do the delegates agree?  That was the motivation behind it.Regarding the overall service provided by guidance counsellors, I refer to a letter from Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, supporting the Institute of Guidance Counsellors' position.  How bad is homophobic bullying, is it getting worse and how are guidance counsellors addressing the issue?  This is not necessarily related to the main topic but I ask for a brief response on how it is being addressed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I discussed this issue with Ms Flanagan last night.  I have had first-hand experience of this initiative in the school in which I taught and concur with the comments made about disadvantaged schools.  This has created a level playing pitch.  While previously French lessons were only available in middle-class schools, the average DEIS school now provides this service.  Children of immigrant families in Sweden have a right to learn the language of their parents, whereas in Ireland we are curtailing a modern languages initiative.  The reality is that we do not do languages well, the biggest example being the Irish language.  Given the amount of time spent by teachers training in the instruction of the teaching of the Irish language and teaching it in primary and secondary schools, every leaving certificate student should be fluent in Irish.  However, that is not the case.Similarly, we are well behind the curve in European terms in modern language teaching.  I will not go through a political statement regarding cuts and strains from the economic position, as we have been through it before and spoke about it last night.  The tragedy is we always discuss these issues in the context of cuts and we never have a long-term view of what language learning will be over time.There was a comment on teacher training.  Is there a potential in the six-month period to discuss that long-term strategy and mainstreaming modern languages?  I often get criticised for making the following point.  The two biggest overarching priority value judgments made in Irish education are the Irish language and religion.  If those are mentioned or criticised by us at any stage, we are in for it.  I know this and am a great advocate of the Irish language.  We must have a different view of our priority system and our value judgments in Irish education.  Although what is happening now is regrettable, will it provide a chance to re-evaluate what we do in education and where languages lie in that regard?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have a quorum.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh and the Chairman, Deputy Damien English.  I remind members to switch off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting.  Members agreed to do so at our first meeting but unfortunately not everyone adhered to it since and it has resulted in significant problems broadcasting the meetings.  I appeal to everyone to take a second to turn off their mobile phones.  We will go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.The joint committee went into private session at 9.40 a.m. and resumed in public session at 9.47 a.m.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the following: Mr. Ciaran Phelan, chief executive, Irish Brokers Association; Mr. Aidan McLoughlin, managing director of the Independent Trustee Company and chairman of the Irish Brokers Association's pensions committee; Ms Linda Gallagher, First Ireland; Mr. Tom Berrigan, Davy; Mr. Gavin Howlin, Willis; and Mr. Frank Lahiffe, Lahiffe & Associates Public Affairs & Political Communications.  They are present to discuss issues and initiatives associated with private pensions.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegates and I invite questions.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Is there not an inherent contradiction in what the witnesses are saying?  They indicated that the average fund is €100,000, which is insufficient over a longer retirement period, yet they also advocate the reduction of restrictions on access to funds.  The result may be a reduction in the safeguards on funds which they have already accepted is not sufficient for retirement.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«How will investors be protected against making short-term decisions that have long-term consequences?  Is 25% too much?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«What kind of restrictions does Mr. McLoughlin envisage?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«In what way would the advice be independent?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank Mr. Phelan and his colleagues for appearing before the committee today.  One Deputy has already indicated her intention to follow this up by means of a parliamentary question and other members might do likewise in order to ascertain the Minister's thoughts on the matter.  I thank the witnesses for their contribution.  I am sure we will return to the subject again.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegates for their presentation and Deputy Conaghan for his initiative in this regard.  We are discussing an issue of value judgment in education.  Much of the debate in regard to education has gone in a particular way in recent years.  As Senator O'Donnell said, we are almost reducing education to the formulation of economic units.  It is all about the jobs market and making oneself marketable.  However, the wonderful thing about education is that some subjects deserve to be taught for the intrinsic beauty they possess and the pleasure they can bring.  Music and art are examples of that.  Learning about them will not necessarily make a person more marketable when it comes to finding a job, but they have their own justification.  Unfortunately, these issues are sometimes sidelined in the context of disadvantage because there is a huge element of firefighting going in within the education system in response to numerous crises.  There can be a tendency in primary schools and among educators to relegate music, for instance, to the second tier of the curriculum.  We often see art classes being taken last thing on a Friday.How do we make arts education part of the mainstream in primary schools?  The initiative the delegates have described is fantastic, but how do we ensure that every primary school in the country has the ability to prioritise the arts?  How do we empower teachers to deliver what the delegates are delivering?  How do we deliver literacy and numeracy through the arts?  Rather than compartmentalising these subjects in certain parts of the day or week, we must seek to devise a classroom experience where the arts are so deeply knitted into how children are taught that they cannot be confined to a half an hour on a Monday or Tuesday.Have the delegates considered how there might be an engagement with the teacher training colleges in order to find new ways of prioritising the arts in the way children are taught?  Education is about preparing oneself for the workplace in some respects, but there is a whole dimension of one's life that is not carried on in the workplace.  It is about one's ability to pick up a book and read it for enjoyment's sake, to appreciate a piece of music or play an instrument, to go to the theatre and take in a play.  These are wonderful activities which are there to be enjoyed.  It is what life is all about.  I would be greatly distressed if our education debate were confined to the nuts and bolts of economic units.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We are now in public session and will deal with new EU legislative proposals.  There is quite a list of them.  First, we will consider a communication from the European Commission on the goods package and nine related EU legislative proposals.  They are: COM(2011)763 concerning the new legislative framework, NLF, alignment package, implementation of the goods package; COM(2011)764 concerning the pyrotechnic articles directive; COM(2011)765 concerning the electromagnetic compatibility directive; COM(2011)766 concerning the non-automatic weighing instruments directive; COM(2011)768 concerning the simple pressure vessels directive; COM(2011)769 concerning the measuring instruments directive; COM(2011)770 on the directive concerning safety components for lifts; COM(2011)771 on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses; COM(2011)772 on protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres; and COM(2011)773 on electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits.The Commission proposes, in one package, to align a number of existing technical directives, which deal with specific products, to the 2008 goods package by using the recast procedure.  Recast is essentially a codification procedure with some minor, but no substantive, changes allowed.  The objective of the measure is to introduce harmonised definitions in terms which are commonly used throughout EU harmonisation legislation and aims to give a consistent meaning throughout that legislation.  Such measures are intended to improve the functioning of the Internal Market.  In view of the information provided by the lead Department, it is proposed that these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.The next three items are also related to each other and concern the Horizon 2020 strategy.  They are: COM(2011)809 establishing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020; COM(2011)810 laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020; and COM(2011)811 establishing the specific programme implementing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020.These three related proposals aim to establish and set down the implementation and distribution rules for the European Union's new funding programme for research and innovation post-2013, namely, Horizon 2020.  The basic principle of Horizon 2020 is to adopt a much more strategic approach to research and innovation.  It also attempts to simplify procedures for participants radically.  The proposed budget for Horizon 2020 is approximately €80 billion.  Negotiations on the proposal will commence in February 2012 and are likely to continue through to the Irish Presidency of the EU commencing in January 2013.  Horizon 2020 is seen as being strategically important in assisting Ireland's economic recovery.It is proposed that these specific proposals do not warrant further scrutiny at this time.  However, in view of the potential importance of research and innovation to Ireland's economic recovery and the resulting importance of Horizon 2020, particularly in view of the proposed funding available under this programme, it is also proposed that the joint committee will write to the Department requesting that it be updated on the progress on the proposals and that this issue be considered for inclusion in the committee's work programme.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Is it agreed that a departmental representative should be requested to provide us with a supplementary briefing on this matter?  Agreed.We will now summon the witnesses from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland before the joint committee.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The joint committee will now discuss ways of promoting entrepreneurship.  I welcome the following witnesses from the IDA: Mr. Barry O'Leary, CEO; Mr. John O'Brien, divisional manager of corporate services, planning and financial management; and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, planning, EU and tax.  I also wish to welcome the following witnesses from Enterprise Ireland: Mr. Frank Ryan, CEO; Mr. Greg Treston, divisional manager, scaling and high potential start-ups; and Mr. Tom Hayes, divisional manager, entrepreneurship and regions.Members of the joint committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2) (l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.With that in mind, I now call on Mr. Frank Ryan to make his presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I apologise, but many members wish to contribute.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Deputy to be as quick as possible.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«People should realise they should turn off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the sound system.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I have three more contributions.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Deputy Halligan asked a question as well.  Can you repeat it?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy has had a good run.  I ask him to conclude his remarks.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I invite the witnesses to respond.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy has made this point three times across his two contributions.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We will get a response to that.Deputy Áine Collins took the Chair.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the delegation for its attendance and presentations.  I have a brief point regarding the issue of unregistered teachers versus unqualified teachers.  There is a big difference between the two.  It is my experience as a former primary school principal that there are occasions when principals in certain parts of the country are desperate to get anybody to stand in front of a class, look after children and stay with them, especially anyone who has any qualification to fulfil those duties.  If that person happens to be retired, that can be the reality many principals face.  Otherwise they must split up the class, thereby impacting on the children.  We need to have a realistic debate about retired teachers.  I do not believe a retired teacher should ever be chosen over a newly qualified person who wants to get into the profession and improve his or her skills.  However, we must recognise that sometimes newly qualified teachers do not want to go into certain schools.  If there is a retired teacher who is familiar with the school, the type of school or the children concerned and who can look after them in a particular way, that should be recognised.I refer, briefly, to redeployment.  The characteristic spirit or ethos of certain schools was discussed and how a particular teacher might not match that ethos.  Will the delegates give an indication as to what type of teacher would not match the characteristic ethos of a particular school?  Why is it so important?Again, on redeployment, I am aware of a situation where a certain bishop is in charge of a panel in a certain part of the country.  He does not accept transfers, he refuses them.  If a person is from a particular part of the country and wants to transfer to the area in question he or she cannot because the bishop says, "No".  Surely we need to have an open investigation into how panels should be organised and how redeployment can happen.  It should not come down to one individual giving a blanket "No" to every transfer that comes across his desk.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Ms Kathleen Stack, assistant secretary of the Department of Social Protection, Mr. Philip Cox, Mr. Bernard Tonge and Mr. David Dillon, principal officers, and Ms Geraldine Gleeson, chief appeals officer.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2) (l) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence at this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible you should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I believe Ms Stack has two presentations and I ask her to begin, with Ms Gleeson to follow.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will take some questions but I remind members not to discuss individual cases if possible.  I realise that on occasions individual cases are used as examples but I ask them not to mention a case about which they are particularly concerned and discuss policy.  I will first call Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh.  Senators John Kelly and Feargal Quinn have indicated.  If other members are interested in putting a question I ask them to indicate that to me.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Does Ms Stack wish to respond to some of those issues before we proceed?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Deputy Lawlor asked what constitutes a long-term illness.  I have been told transplant patients are not considered as having a long-term illness, which I think is strange.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this and on the issues raised by Deputy Lawlor.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Does Ms Stack wish to comment on this?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Ms Stack will take it on board.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Deputy to conclude.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I ask the delegation to respond to Deputies Kyne, Fleming and Joan Collins's remarks.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I have a few quick questions.  Recently there has been a lot of comment on the 17,000 anonymous complaints.  Can the delegation give a basic breakdown on the type of complaints? Has the nature of complaints changed over the past number of years?  Is there a need for an information campaign on what foreign nationals are entitled to?  The amount of misinformation on what people assume foreign nationals are entitled to is outrageous.  The amount of misinformation on foreign nationals' entitlements is absolutely outrageous.  This is leading to some very unfortunate commentary and suspicion.Senator Mullins touched on the move from welfare to work.  In this regard, let me refer to the poverty trap of social welfare, the cage that protects but does not set one free.  How can we make it easier for people to move from welfare to work?  Some 93,000 casual part-time workers in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance want to work full-time but perhaps do not understand or have the necessary information on the entitlements they would retain if they did so.  Could the delegates comment on that?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I am not saying they are.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Are there any suggestions that more complaints are proving to have merit now than in the past?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Is that a higher percentage than that which obtained in previous years?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Okay.  There seems to be a lot of misinformation.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for attending, for being so frank and giving us such valuable information.  I appreciate it.  I thank Ms Stack and Ms Gleeson in particular for making the presentations.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the gentlemen for attending the committee.  I would like to make points on macroeconomic policies and on youth unemployment.  However, I will start with a criticism because I note the document talks about the partnership years and how the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and member unions were strongly critical of deregulation and so on.  It states that voices were heard but seldom heeded and it was provided with opportunities to express its contrary views on privatisation.  I have a criticism of unions which now say they were not heard or listened to during the partnership process.  I wonder why they stuck around because during that time when inequality was deepening and there were 150,000 people on the live register, 50,000 of whom were long-term unemployed, there were  opportunities to offer an opposing viewpoint but that was not done.  It is difficult when we have gone through the process and have had an economic crash to listen to union leaders criticise Government policy when those union leaders were sitting at the partnership table eyeballing and swapping croissants with Bertie Ahern and various Ministers during the boom time.Having said that, I would like to ask specific questions on the macroeconomic situation.  I was at a meeting on Monday morning with some employers.  It was a jobs roadshow and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, were in Clontarf Castle to talk about the jobs action plan.  One of the points raised was the need to focus on import substitution.  Rather than talk about exports so much, we need to talk about import substitution, as in the production line and the manufacturing line, and about substituting in the domestic economy that which is being imported.  Are there any comments on that issue?On the issue of broadening the tax base, I ask the witnesses to discuss their reference to a higher tax regime.  Given that many employers say they are subventing local government in terms of commercial rates, water charges and so on, is Congress in favour of a property charge to take the pressure off the commercial sector?  My view is that a fair and progressive property charge is a wealth tax and is the most effective way of implementing such a tax.The issues of youth unemployment and young men have not received enough focus.  It should be noted that young men are not succeeding as well as they should.  It is not a young man versus a young woman situation but it is an issue.What are the views of the witnesses in respect of the national literacy strategy, implemented by Government, and the new SOLAS proposals, the further education proposals and VEC proposals and their likely effects?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I welcome both groups to today's meeting.  From youngballymun we have Ms Eleanor McClorey, CEO, and Ms Hazel O'Byrne, projects officer.  From the National College of Ireland we have Dr. Philip Matthews, president, Mr. Dan O'Connor, member of the review board, early learning initiative and Dr. Josephine Bleach, director, early learning initiative.  The witnesses are all very welcome.  As they may be aware the committee covers issues under the remit of three Departments and our members are particularly interested in educational disadvantage.  We are pleased the witnesses could attend today to discuss their initiatives.I will inform those present of the position on privilege.  I will read out the rights of witnesses before they get to say anything.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentations I will outline for the committee the basis on which the invitation was made.  A report is being done by me and other members – Deputy John Lyons is involved as well – on educational disadvantage outside of the formal school system.  We sent an invitation to the Department to talk about DEIS but that is not necessarily the focus of the report because educational disadvantage is social disadvantaged transferred to schools.  On that basis we wish to talk to the witnesses about the community element of their work, the research element of it, the breaking down of educational disadvantage in the community and preschool and after-school activities.  That is the focus of the report.  We do not wish necessarily to get into what happens in school time because children do not live in schools and it is the communities from which they come that have a massive role to play in addressing the problems that exist in terms of educational disadvantage.  With that preamble I invite Ms McClorey to begin her presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for two interesting and excellent presentations.  Deputy Smith will be the first member to ask questions, to be followed by Deputies Conaghan, Mitchell O'Connor and Butler.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«I will bank some questions and come back after a while.  Is Deputy Conaghan finished?  Is he happy?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«It was not a general question.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«Is Deputy Conaghan happy that he has made his contribution?
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We will return to our guest to respond to the issues raised.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«It was referred to earlier.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The final contribution will be from Deputy Murphy, after which the witnesses can respond.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«We have asked a question and it is only fair that we give-----
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«The point has been made.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«A vote has just been called so we may have to move on.
AodhanORiordan«Vice Chairman«2011-03-09«None«It is probably a good time to conclude as a vote has been called in the Dáil Chamber.  Sometimes we think we have heard everything that is to said about educational disadvantage, only to learn to learn new information.  Those statistics from the Hart-Risley report on the vocabulary differential between rich and poor children are really striking.  It is a key indicator of how we are not tackling the issue properly at an early age.  Ireland, until a few years ago, had almost zero investment in pre-school education, and that is the sector that would see the greatest benefit.  I am aware that youngballymun did a presentation on that.There has been a suggestion that people should visit these projects and we might speak to the groups, either individually or as a collective, to organise that.  Collective visits have not been overly successful in the past as a particular date may not suit people.  If the groups are willing, I am sure Members would like to visit and see the work.  A report is being compiled and we would appreciate submissions from any member of the committee.  The idea is to take educational disadvantage out of schools and start talking properly about what makes the biggest impact.  The groups present today are making a big difference with their work and we very much appreciate them taking time to come here and present to the committees.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. Time is relatively short so I will ask two main questions. The Labour Party supports this Bill and will table amendments as it proceeds. Anyone may respond. I am not directing my comments at anyone in particular. The industry in general is typified by two main issues which I will raise. These will be commented on as the Bill goes through the Houses. One is the nature of workers' rights in the general industry. It is typified by minimum wage work. The industry will now be asking workers to work later to serve people who will be drinking longer into the evening. No improvement in workers' rights regulations has ever been welcomed by the industry. Whenever there is a movement on minimum wage, an improvement of sick pay or whatever it may be, it seems to be a difficult matter for people to grasp. How can we improve the working life of people who work in the industry at the lowest level and ensure this will not be a further negative impact on their careers? We are asking them to work later, deeper into night with people who have more alcohol on board. The second issue is public health. Alcohol is a drug and it costs the health services approximately €3 billion every year. Approximately 100 people die of fatal overdoses of alcohol every year. We must put our minds towards those who will be dealing with what happens on the street outside the various different venues, pubs and so on. An Garda Síochána has its point of view about how it will be policed. The health service has its point of view as to how it will be dealt with. Those are the main criticisms we as Oireachtas Members will get about our evaluation of this Bill. The Labour Party feels it is beyond time that this legislation was changed and upgraded. From a Dublin perspective, Dublin city centre is dying and needs to be revitalised. We must treat people as adults in this field and therefore I want to hear from the witnesses about regulations around this. I do not mind who responds on the workers' rights piece about people who are generally poorly paid in the industry and do not have great conditions and how will the industry will deal with the criticisms from those who work in An Garda Síochána or the health service about how they feel they can come on board with these changes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations and submissions. I will make some general comments and anybody who wants to react to what I have to say can do so. Last week, industry representatives came before us. In terms of the Bill, we were very taken by what the Give Us the Night campaign had to say about Dublin city centre being under great pressure and cultural spaces being under assault by degrees. Many members are minded to be sympathetic to that view. Extended licensing hours in that cultural environment is something that should be welcomed. However, having listened to the industry representatives I must point out that it is an industry which, in general, has been typified by lower paid and insecure work. It has never really been welcoming to any strengthening of workers' rights in that regard. I made that point to the industry representatives last week.  Some spoke about a pub as being the centre of a community and that they wanted to seek UNESCO status for the Irish pub. One begins to wonder how on earth we have reached a situation where the centre of the community is a pub and that UNESCO status is what we should be seeking for the Irish pub. Is that an absolute and utter failure of Irish society in general? I am aware of the 100 people who die of fatal overdoses of alcohol every year. We are all aware of the €3 billion plus it costs every year and the influence that alcohol has on violence against women and in general. Any witness can answer my question which relates to the Bill and also wider society. I was a teacher in a primary school for 11 years and became very aware of how bombarded people are by messaging all of the time. People can come from families that are very restrictive in terms of access to alcohol, says all the right things and brings up their children all the right ways, but children are not just influenced by their families but also wider society, their peers and what is expected of them. For whatever reason, our public health messaging, be it in schools or elsewhere, is not strong enough or is not getting through.  Young people ask me how they can believe messaging when the generation before them drinks all of the time, drinks a lot, celebrates drinking a lot or finds it very funny when people drink too much. The generation before them drank too much, and celebrated it and thought it was funny. Are we losing the cultural war when we have come to a scenario whereby somebody, can, in all honesty, come to a committee like this and say with a straight face that we need UNESCO status for the Irish pub? Are we completely failing, given all that we know about the damage alcohol does to Irish society? That is a wider educational piece and societal message around alcohol and its availability. I would like Mr. Light to expand on the workers' rights piece. If this legislation is enacted, it will lead to people working in an environment that is potentially less safe because people will have consumed more alcohol at a later time of the night. Those workers have to access a way home safely and they have to be around people who will be more emboldened and violent - and the other risks that are attached to that.  My contribution is the wider education piece, the wider societal messaging and how we can balance that with a need for us to treat people like adults and be responsible. However, it feels like a war that we are losing. My direct question to Mandate is about how we can strengthen the workers’ rights within the Bill to ensure that anybody who takes on these licences for later opening hours has curtailments within that as to how their workers can be treated and protected.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am not a member of the committee but I am interested in the topic. I was attending another committee which is still sitting but I wanted to listen to this debate. I have only been here for 20 minutes and the debate has been fascinating. I am a former principal and teacher of an inner city girls school that is in an area of acute disadvantage. One cannot introduce legislation without a cultural shift in society or educational programmes taking place. I have a sense of how young girls and young men view themselves in terms of their sexuality and sexual power. I know about the commercial pressures that are placed on children which shortens their childhood and demands them to be sexual objects before they are ready. Does that play a part in dealing with prostitution here? The delegation may have touched on the matter earlier and I apologise for going over old ground. How big a role does drugs play in leading people into the sex trade? I was a political counsellor in the inner city and I had to deal with an issue related to street prostitution. At the time the Garda suggested that a drug habit led to the huge number of young women in prostitution. The Swedish approach seems to be the most sensible. The delegation has outlined the comparative situations in the countries that surround Sweden and it has led people to believe that the Swedish model is a good approach. However, other issues need to be tackled such as educational disadvantage, poverty, drugs and the sexualisation of young people. This is not a simple matter and I look forward to hearing the response.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The witness initially indicated that it would be a mistake to state that all women involved in the sex trade are at risk. I am not sure if I heard that correctly. The witness also indicated that saying something like this would have a disempowering effect. Will she elaborate? The Irish Feminist Network is advocating an education programme and schools were mentioned. Schools only go so far so is there a recommendation on how a wider societal public awareness campaign can be mounted around the sex industry or rights of women?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I acknowledge the committee has a great deal of work to do not only on the demand side, but on the supply side as well. Poverty has a huge part to play in that but I was struck by the reference to the 14 year old who was brought into the sex trade by her mother. How prevalent is that practice? Did this result from coercion or was it a by-product of total family dysfunction?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute to the meeting given that I am not a member of the joint committee. I know the witnesses before the joint committee as I am a member of the education committee of Pavee Point. If that restricts me from making a statement or amounts to a conflict of interest, I ask the Chairman to alert me.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is in the nature of Irish politics that it tends to represent the more powerful. If one considers the composition of the Dáil, it is 87% male, almost exclusively white, does not include anyone from a Traveller background, as far as we are aware, and has few Members from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, community. Unfortunately, therefore, when one seeks to run for election some people use hatred of minorities as a political platform. Given that minorities are powerless and do not have the same access to mainstream media as others or political power and people willing to advocate for them, the fear factor tends to win out. Unfortunately, the Traveller community has been on the receiving end of prejudice, including in some disgraceful recent cases. Individual councillors or Deputies who have made outrageous statements have never paid a political price for doing so. Inequality is incredibly destructive. Discrimination and inequality impacts on the individual and his or her community and hangs over him or her for life. I am delighted we are having a positive discussion about a step the country and travelling community wish to take. A major healing process can take place between two groups that have probably never come to terms with each other. This is what is so engaging, attractive and positive about the discussion on ethnic status for Traveller people. The international argument for ethnic status is undeniable. Do the witnesses agree that it would be a wonderful step for the Traveller community, one which would also bring responsibility, and something the settled community will also have to embrace and celebrate? Ethnic status must not be viewed as exclusively an issue for the Traveller community, as it is one for all of Irish society and one which everyone should feel part of and celebrate. In response to the decision made at the weekend on gay marriage, some people indicated their marriage will be slightly diminished if we extend marriage rights to other people. I ask the witnesses to nail the lie that ethnic status for Travellers will somehow diminish other people's sense of themselves or identity. On the contrary, it is a major cause for celebration. An argument based on the law of unintended consequences is always rolled out to oppose such steps. 
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to speak today on the direct provision system for accommodating applicants for international protection.I have been to the forefront in seeking reform of this system and, to that end, I very much welcome the committee's interest in this matter. It is my wish that this engagement today helps, not hinders, the ongoing consultative process which I will explain in more detail in a few moments. The direct provision system came about in the context of an unprecedented increase in the numbers of asylum seekers coming into the country in the late 1990s. At that time, the majority of protection seekers lived in Dublin and were treated as homeless, which involved emergency accommodation and local authority housing. The shortage of accommodation reached crisis point and the then Eastern Health Board understandably could not cope. There were reports of protection seeker families sleeping in parks. In November 1999, the Government resolved the crisis by having the needs of protection seekers met by a system of direct provision which involved the dispersal of protection seekers throughout the country. It is 15 years later and more than 4,400 persons live in 34 asylum accommodation centres throughout the State, which is a reduction from 60 centres in 2008. That is a simple statistic. If one drills down further, one will see the human element involved. Of these residents, approximately one third are adult males, one third are adult females and one third are children. Drilling down further, 36% of residents have been in the overall system for up to three years, 43% for between three and seven years and 21% for seven years or more. Everyone living in direct provision has his or her own story to tell. People may be at different stages of the protection determination process or may even have taken a legal challenge against a negative decision made in respect of them. Indeed, they may be at the end of the process but cannot move on. For example, more than 500 of the residents in the direct provision system have permission to remain in the State but cannot move on because of difficulties sourcing private accommodation. Almost 600 residents have deportation orders outstanding against them, the vast majority of which issued over a year ago. They are required to report periodically to the Garda National Immigration Bureau. There are many reasons orders are not or cannot be enforced, including the issuing of legal actions, the making of sequential protection applications for members within a family group, the absence of the travel documents required for the return to the country of origin and so on. Members of the committee have visited centres to see for themselves the conditions in which residents live. I have done so too. I have visited a centre in Sligo, two in Waterford, two in Limerick, one each in Galway, Laois and Clare, three in Dublin and also Mosney. Members will have seen, as have I, that all residents share the common experience of a life revolving around waiting and hoping. Residents cannot cook for themselves, engage in work or otherwise gainfully occupy themselves during the day. It has to be said that the direct provision system does not exist in a vacuum. It has to be seen in the context of the overarching international protection processing system of which direct provision is but one element, albeit a very important one to those who have to avail of its services. To make progress on direct provision, it is necessary to address both it and the protection system itself in a coherent, thought-out fashion. This is what the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 commits us to do. In terms of processing, last week the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, published the general scheme of the international protection Bill, the aim of which is to reduce waiting times for asylum applicants. The key purpose of the Bill is to replace the existing multi-layered protection determination system with a single procedure, the aim of which is to enable timely and efficient protection decisions to be made. This single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and will be granted status and those who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their countries of origin. The single procedure has been requested for many years by many NGOs and others. The intention is for the Bill to deal with as many of those who are currently in the system as possible. A practical approach is envisaged with those who have reached a certain point in the existing process continuing along their current path while others at earlier stages of the process will be brought within the single procedure. In addition to committing to legislative change in this area, the Government has set up an independent working group to report to it on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. It is chaired by the former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society. The working group developed a work programme early on and established three subgroups to deal with the following themes. The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims, essentially the long stay problem. Almost 40 meetings at plenary and subgroup level have taken place since the first meeting of the working group on 11 November 2014. The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents. It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. The chairman of the group has publicly stated that these contributions have informed the sense of urgency that has underpinned its work. He has gone on to say that all of its members are genuinely engaged in the task at hand, namely, to identify a set of recommendations to Government for improvements that will bring tangible benefits to existing and future applicants. The chairman says that the deliberations of the working group are at a crucial stage with each of the subgroups developing their proposals for submission to the plenary group over the next number of weeks. The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies. When I wrote to the committee on 21 October 2014, I said that I hoped to be in a position to brief members on the first stages of the working group's work. At that time, I anticipated that the working group would issue an interim report. However, as is the right of the independent group, it decided not to issue an interim report and proceeded with its work on the basis that it would issue a singular report. While the agreed terms of reference do not indicate a timeframe for the working group's deliberations, I understand that it will be only a matter of weeks after Easter when the report will be ready. The working group published its work programme in November 2014 fleshing out the issues to be discussed by each of the three themed subgroups to which I referred earlier. I arranged for the work programme to be circulated to the committee before this meeting. From my own perspective, some of the key issues relate to the scope for residents to prepare their own meals within existing or new physical structures; limitations on the length of time persons spend in the direct provision system; financial supports; and improved processing times. It would be futile and damaging at this crucial stage of its proceedings to second guess the work of the group. We have to allow it to complete its work. I do not propose to engage in any detailed discussion on any of the issues in the work programme on which the working group may make recommendations. That is the group's job. I have every confidence in the capacity of the chairman and members of the working group to do their work. This is a difficult subject. I have no doubt that there have been robust discussions within the working group. As practising politicians, we know that negotiations and discussions are sometimes hard and that there are varying shades among the membership of any group engaged in such discussions. We all recognise the importance of working together to achieve real, tangible change. I am firmly of the belief that more can be achieved within the working group than outside it. I know the committee will allow the process to continue and to give it a fair wind. As part of its deliberations, I had arranged for the working group to be provided with a transcript of the proceedings on this subject at this committee on 22 October 2014. Similarly, I will arrange for a transcript of today's proceedings to be provided also. I look forward to hearing the views of members on this matter.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have visited a number of centres. They vary in their standards. Some are excellent. Some are much less so. I could envisage staying in some, but there are some in which I would not spend a night. No matter what the standard of accommodation is, those who are seeking asylum do not want to live in direct provision centres. I cannot stand over a system in which the issues that the Senator has outlined continue, that belittles people, in which people live hopeless, unproductive lives and where they stay for a number of years. I could stand over a system where there was a number of excellent centres in which people lived fulfilling lives and engaged in training, education and more, where they stayed for just a number of months, not years, and where the issues outlined by the Senator no longer existed. I cannot stand over a system in which the institutionalisation of families becomes a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly reality. Initially, I was reluctant to engage with the committee on this issue because of the nature of the work that was being undertaken by the working group. In my personal opinion, we could have a system of direct provision that afforded people their dignity, but that would only be possible if people living in centres had excellent facilities and a meaningful existence, were rooted in the hearts of their communities with all of the essential links, had genuine family lives and their stays were short, by which I mean six months and no longer.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is the reason the issue is being discussed by the working group. It is also the reason that the group comprises people from the Children's Rights Alliance who have child protection expertise. I am sure that they are making their opinions robustly known and that the recommendations will be at the forefront of the report whenever it arrives on my desk.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the Senator asking whether the directive will form part of the protection Bill?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator is right, in that the IRP Bill was wide, large legislation and had been going around the Houses for a number of years. It made sense for the Minister to remove from that Bill the protection Bill, the general scheme of which has only just been published. The intention is for the latter to undergo the pre-legislative stage before a committee. It is within that process that Members can make their opinions on the EU directive known. The working group will also have opinions in that regard. I am not trying to be evasive, but I am minded of the fact that we established a working group that people were determined to keep independent. It is for a deliberate reason that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I have not been involved in the group, namely, we did not want a perception of political overtones in or unwarranted political influence over its work. We wanted to ensure that people could make their comments or representations or do their work without involvement from or interference by practising politicians. I expect that the members of the working group have made the Senator's points. I expect that those issues will be to the forefront of their minds as they compile their final report, which is due a number of weeks after Easter. I also expect that members of the justice committee will make the same recommendations during the pre-legislative stage of the protection Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The IRC and Ms Conlan can speak for themselves.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can only speak from my perception of how the group is working. As I have outlined in my statement, I firmly believe that, if one wants to get solutions, the best place to be is in a room with people who are determined to find them. I am committed to finding a way forward and want to turn the page on the current system. Many people in the Houses of the Oireachtas have raised deep concerns about the system. From the first moments I walked into this House people from all parties have raised concerns about the process and direct provision, in particular. We have had quite a number of robust exchanges in the Seanad on the matter. It is to the credit of Seanad Éireann, in particular, for taking on the issue. It has raised issues and concerns about direct provision with me for quite a while. I know that the place for improvements and changes in the system is within the working group. I know that the people in the subgroups have remained with the process and are determined to be part of something that will deliver real change. This is a once in a generation opportunity, after 15 years of overseeing the system, to deliver something that will lead to change. My decision to not be involved with the group in a hands-on manner was deliberate. I trust the people engaged in the process and know them to be people of integrity, both within the Department and the various NGOs. We have talked about direct provision for a number of years. For many of the people involved this has been a 15-year campaign. My involvement has been shorter and dates from my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality. We are so close to getting a report that will deliver change that I am willing to wait until I see it. I believe the chairman and members of the group will be proud of their work and that we will, collectively, be proud of the report when published. I have anticipated the recommendations and am sure that we will collectively look back on this period saying it was a job well done.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I shall ask Mr. Noel Dowling to relay the factual position, from the Department's point of view, and shall give my own personal perspective afterwards.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I agree with Senator Ó Clochartaigh that, if one is a victim of rape, sexual violence or torture, one needs to have care that is better than can be provided by somebody who is running a dry cleaning company.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will give my initial response to that. I do not know if Mr. Dowling or Mr. Kelly want to come in on that. On the people who are still in direct provision when they do not have to be there, I think there is a challenge for us in the future to find a step-down facility or a halfway situation because I think it would be unreasonable to expect somebody to go from a long period of living in a direct provision centre to trying to access essential services such as housing or social protection and not to have some kind of halfway situation. I do not know what that would look like but certainly the figures would suggest that people are finding it difficult to transition from direct provision into community living or independent living and it is their own decision to stay within direct provision. Certainly it is a challenge for us to find a resolution to that. I assume in the most recent past that the housing issue generally in the country was part of the problem. Does Mr. Dowling want to provide more context to that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The other issue is that if one has been in a centre for a number of years, if one's children attend the local school, if there is some kind of community linkage, or if one is doing some voluntary work in the community, then one probably wants to stay close to that general community in the short term. That can also be a factor in people staying in the centre beyond the period when they have to stay.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There has been a level of heightened expectation because the work of the working group has been ongoing and there have been a number of visits to different centres. Members are aware of the centres and I have also been visiting centres. There will be a report to Government and the Government will decide to publish or not. It is my expectation that it will be published and it should be published. I agree with the Deputy there will likely be short-term and immediate fixes that could be introduced immediately and others are longer-term aspects. The report is the beginning rather than the end of the process.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the Deputy referring to the average stay?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I remember travelling to Genoa in 2001. I remember the people I travelled over with and I remember not travelling back with them. I involved myself in a few protests and then joined Oxfam in not protesting on the second day because of the type of activity some people were engaging in at the time. I remember getting tear gas for my troubles but that is a trip down memory lane.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the working group, people are in politics if they want to achieve things. If they believe something is wrong and must be remedied, fixed or reformed, the job is to find some way to do it. People in the working group have been working incredibly hard and have been campaigning on the issue for quite some time, as have politicians in the House. I give credit to some sections of the media. We can be critical of them in the political system but I have great respect for a number of campaigning journalists. They have given the human dimension and stories behind the reality of direct provision. How do we come to a conclusion? What is the best way of advancing the cause of those within direct provision sectors who want a life? The determination of Government was to assemble a group of people who are experts in the field. We could have been accused of having a working group made up of people who have a particular perspective but we invited people who know the system inside out from the advocacy point of view and asked them to play their part in finding a solution. This involves people who are campaigners on the asylum system, the protection system, campaigners for children, academics, people with a trade union background and those with a history of finding solutions to real problems. I want conclusion brought to their deliberations but nothing is ever simple in life. I wish it were so. In trying to find a solution, we must find something that will last and work. We have inherited something I cannot stand over and I have made my language as clear and forthright as I can. I am quite sure people in the Department of Justice and Equality do not like me saying things with such forthright language because it is a system they have been trying to deal with over a period of time.What is more important than my position or the positions of those on the working group, is what will happen when that report is published and how it will affect the lives of people in the system. I go to these centres and see the children there, and I consider their lives and futures. I meet people, the same age as myself, who have literally been broken by the system. I met a man in Limerick who was in a bad way when he got here, but the system we have has compounded his misery.  I see children who do not have the basic family-based type of modelling for food preparation that every other child takes for granted. It is very much a human reaction to a system. It is not a black and white report. We are dealing with human beings and their aspirations and dreams, which we have in our hands. So what do we do with that? We are charged with that awesome responsibility. The best thing to do is to get in with like-minded people who are charged with looking after the system, to try to find a better one.  The Deputy may have already rejected what the working group is doing. He may have already rejected what the report says, even before he sees it, but I will not do so because I trust the people who are doing the work. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy asked two straight questions. The Irish Refugee Council can speak for itself, but the best place to be is making these points within the working group. That is my answer to the Deputy's first question. Second, I want this working group to succeed. From its very beginning most people were willing to give the group a fair wind. A minority were willing it to fail and tried to find reasons to pick holes in it. Hand on heart, however, I am impressed by the composition of the working group, the issues it is addressing and the way it has set about its work. The number of meetings it has had, including the establishment of various sub-groups, are also impressive.  If the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I had been attending every single meeting of the working group, we would be accused of political interference. In addition, people would say the group was not independent and its members could not speak openly. However, the working group has rightly gone out of its way to hear as many testimonies of the realities of living in direct provision as it possibly could. We have a short time in politics and my time in this Department will most likely be short as well, with possibly a year to go. In that time, more than anything, I want to achieve reform in this area. I know that the working group will deliver that. The Deputy may not have the same faith as I do, but I have it. I trust that when the report comes out, and hopefully the Government will agree to publish it - I expect so - it will be the beginning of a whole new start for people in the protection system. Their faith in the working group will have been justified.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I shall respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett and you, Chairman. I have two brief points. First, the assumption that some things are off limits to the working group is incorrect. There are no limits to what can be discussed by it. The right to work is being openly discussed. I believe we are practically the only country in the European Union to have a limitation on allowing refugee applicants to work. My views on the matter remain the same. Assumptions have been made about the working group which do not stand up to scrutiny. I welcome your suggestion, Chairman. Every political system across Europe has been strangled with immigration. We in this Parliament are spending time in the Seanad and in the Dáil responding to oral questions and written parliamentary questions on trying to improve the situation for people who come to this country seeking protection. That is a credit to these Houses and to the committee and other committees that wish to debate the issue. I agree with your suggestion, Chairman.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Again, the Deputy is pre-empting the report.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are no limits to anything anybody wants to discuss. The Deputy can list 47 different things he wants to know are being discussed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«To my knowledge, all issues are being discussed. Nothing is off limits, but I have not been at a working group meeting. I am allowing the group to have the independence it sought. The group is an independent working group outside of political interference. I know the members are discussing all the issues the people in this room, those outside it and those who are in direct provision centres feel passionately about.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The overarching question is that of "when" with respect to people in the system. As the Deputy has quite rightly said, we do not want a report, with recommended actions and Government support, but no timeline for those actions to be taken. It is not my decision as to whether the report will be published but I assume it will. On receipt of the report we can collectively ensure that whatever actions are recommended can be seen to be enacted. The people in the centres and the system deserve and need that. They need us. People often correctly diminish politics in many circumstances but we are genuinely charged with the responsibility of looking after the interests of possibly the most vulnerable people in our country. If a report comes in that again heightens expectations and people finally believe - after years and possibly a decade or more of being in the system - that there is finally a breakthrough, the last thing they want is a report that is put on the long finger or not implemented as a matter of urgency. I accept the invitation to return if we can view it as a collective effort, across parties and non-partisan, to put our efforts behind ensuring that recommendations can be driven forward if they are accepted by the committee. We have seen that done in the Seanad before.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issues raised are at the forefront of the matters engaged by the working group. I may be giving a similar answer about not impeding the work or being seen to interfere too much. The Chairman mentioned parenting and modelling food preparation. That can sometimes be overlooked as a minor issue but it is not as we are talking about people's childhood. Some people in 50 or 60 years will be saying that they spent their formative years in a direct provision centre. That is strong in my mind in dealing with the issue. Some staff in these centres work really hard and care passionately about people under their care. They make the same comments to me, the others present today and people in the system. Every day, they see the humanity and family life with which they engage. A child playing with a kitchen may not know what it feels like to pour something and may not know how to ask for juice because they are not used to that model of parenting. It has a long-lasting effect when we consider the responsibility that we have to try to change this system. All these issues arise from a sense of care and what family life, human life and connectedness should be like. Deputy Nolan's point is important as asylum is a sacred international status. It is something that is very serious and important. We are mindful of that but life is short, and childhood is particularly short. When we composed the working group and gave out invitations, we wanted to have people with a child focus and understanding at the heart of deliberations. I know that is the case so I look forward to the report being published and discussed here further.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the working group is so close to its final determination, it is realistic to wait until it has concluded. Both the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children have been in touch with the Chairman and had robust discussions. The Chairman is clear about their opinions on the matters, as I am. We will await the report.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In the previous Oireachtas I was Minister of State in this Department and we came to the view that the Department needed to change completely. We came to believe that there possibly needed to be a full Department of culture and the arts, with a Cabinet Minister as they have in other European countries. I am horrified that this Government has decided to make the arts a footnote in the Department and not to even have a dedicated Minister of State. This area can be accused unfairly of being elitist or a luxury but groups on the edge of Irish society, such as Travellers, migrants, people living in poverty or with an addiction always turn to the arts to give voice to what they are going through. It is often the only platform they have as they do not have access to mainstream media. I have found that the arts are fundamental to national conversations and if we reduce funding to the arts, as has happened, or do not promote them, we dilute the discussion about equality that every country needs to have. What are the countries which have Bills or Acts on the status of artists and what has been the effect of such legislation? I believe there is legislation of this type in Canada. Why do the witnesses feel it is so important? My first sentence may have been political but I feel that one thing this cross-party committee can work on collectively would be to produce such a Bill or a report recommending a Bill. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am very interested in that part of the presentation but can the witnesses give me an example of how this has worked well in other jurisdictions? Have they heard of good experiences from other jurisdictions or how it has worked?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I apologise for having to leave the meeting shortly. I welcome the delegation, which includes some of my constituents. Senators are elected by councillors and I thank them for all the support they gave me over the course of the Seanad election. I wish to ask a number of questions. The representative from Cavan mentioned Brexit and obviously that is going to be key for the Border region. Brexit will need a whole-of-government approach due to the impact it will have on the State, particularly the Border region. Is there an attempt by the Government, or a conversation happening among members of the Government, in respect of the Border region? How could local councillors contribute in that regard? I wish to ask a question of the representative from Kells. I spent some time as a Minister of State in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and there was a push at that time for a regional centre for the arts to be based around Kells and to promote Kells as a cultural corridor. It was interesting that the representative from Cavan also mentioned having an emphasis in that part of the world around culture and heritage. What is the current position regarding that plan? It had great potential when we discussed it with representatives from the area. As the Chairman said, when people begin to criticise the EPA and designated lands, I become a little nervous. However, I remember in my own constituency trying to get a flat complex knocked down in order to get better housing conditions for the residents. It turned out that the flat complex, even though it was riddled with people abusing heroin and all sorts of difficulties, was listed. Therefore, it could not be demolished. It is still there, just beside Croke Park. While the listing system used by Dublin City Council is absolutely sacred and we never suggested that it should be interfered with, we found ourselves thinking of some way in which we could get around it. The gentleman from Connemara mentioned that there had been situations throughout the country with regard to designated lands and there seemed to be a suggestion that there are different things happening in different areas. I do not know if it would be appropriate for him to provide an example but if he could do so, it would be interesting to get the relevant information.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I seek a response on the Brexit question.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Nóta gealltanais.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Tá brón orm ach caithfidh mé imeacht i gceann cúpla nóiméad mar tá cruinniú eile agam.  Gabhaim míle buíochas leis na finnéithe uilig as bheith anseo inniu.  Bhí Gabrielle Leleu ag caint faoi theangacha Eorpacha agus an gearradh siar a tharla leo sin.

An rud atá muid ag iarraidh a dhéanamh ná díriú isteach ar dhaoine nach bhfuil cumas léitheoireachta ar chor ar bith acu.  An fhadhb atá againn anseo ná go bfhuil lear mór páistí, go háirithe in áiteanna atá faoi mhíbhuntáiste, sna scoileanna DEIS, nach bhfuil cumas léitheoireachta acu ar chor ar bith.  Chaith mise níos mó ná deich mbliana i scoil mar sin.  Táimid ag iarraidh an airgid ar fad a shábháil muid mar gheall ar an ghearradh siar sin a dhíriú isteach orthu siúd nach bhfuil cumas léitheoireachta acu in aon teanga agus sin an cinneadh a bhí déanta.Is maith an rud é gur cuireadh an méid sin béime ar chúrsaí ealaíne agus spóirt mar uaireanta nuair a dhéantar plé ar chúrsaí oideachais, déantar an nasc idir oideachas agus an geilleagar an t-am ar fad ach téann daoine ar scoil ní hamháin chun bheith in ann post a fháil ach chun rudaí a fhoghlaim ar mhaithe leo féin.Maidir leis an hathruithe atá le teacht isteach ar an teastas sóisearach, táimid ag rá gur chóir 60% de na marcanna a chur ar scrúduithe agus 40% a chur ar obair leanúnach, cén tuairim atá ag na daoine óga air sin?  Ar chóir rudaí a choimeád mar atá siad, leis na marcanna ar fad bunaithe ar na scrúduithe nó an bhfuil an iomarca brú ar dhaltaí mar thoradh air sin nó ar chóir dúinn sin a roinnt mar a luaigh mé.  Tá múinteoirí ag rá go gcuireann sin iomarca struis ar na múinteoirí agus go bhfuil sé cothrom, marcanna a thabhairt do na páipéir scrúdaithe atá os a gcomhair.  Cad é tuairim na ndaltaí faoi sin?

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Glacaim leis an méid a dúradh faoi chorpoideachas.  Bhí cruinniú agam i scoil i mo cheantar féin le déanaí agus fuair mé amach go bhfuil siad ag déanamh a lán ábhar ach níl corpoideachas mar rogha ag daltaí sa chúigiú agus sa séú bhliain.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I nominate Deputy Dominic Hannigan for the position of Chairman.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I extend a welcome to our guests.  It is great that they are here because I think this is the first time we have heard things from a Unionist perspective.  We have been having meetings since the general election in February and there was a committee in the last Dáil, yet we never obtained such a perspective.  Therefore, this is a very important day for us.I will provide a Dublin perspective.  My mother comes from the Border and my father from Dublin.  He had absolutely no interest in anything to do with Northern Ireland.  Whenever issues related to Northern Ireland were dealt with on television during the 1980s, it was turned off.  There are many in the South who would not admit to this or think that is the reality and as such, we have to work on it.I understand social exclusion, as I worked in Sheriff Street in Dublin's north inner city for 11 years.  I said at the previous meeting that much of the interface violence we saw on our television screens in places such as Portadown during the summer was something I recognised from where I worked.  What we have are young people - generally young men - who are disengaged and disenchanted, who are looking for empowerment and something to get excited about.  Where I work it is the drugs trade, anti-social behaviour, joyriding and so on that excites them.  There is a level of convenience in the flag of sectarianism to which a young man could easily attach himself when he feels so disempowered because of his alienation from society.  We were in the interface areas last week and it was interesting to see the two communities in the Tiger's Bay area because there was so much that united them.  They both have issues with housing, unemployment and anti-social behaviour, yet in one area it is green, white and orange on the kerb and red, white and blue in the other area.  When we come to deal with commemorative issues, we should think about the social reality of what actually happened.I had a granduncle who fought in the 1916 Rising.  On one level, he is a family hero, but when we pick through his history, we find that he married a Northern Protestant and had to get married at 7 a.m. because effectively he lived in a sectarian 26 county state.  There were no celebrations.  He had two children, both of whom emigrated to England because there was no work to be found in this country.  Whatever he had fought for in 1916 he felt was completely worthless at the end of his life.  He believed all the pomp and ceremony associated with the rising amounted to a betrayal.  Giving people a flag is not enough.  They must have the dignity that comes with having a job, a home they can call their own, a family to love and an area of which they can be proud.  Flags and emblems, therefore, can be very dangerous.I am coming back to the issue of sectarianism because in ten years we will still have the underlying problems.  We have a problem at the moment in the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland with religious influence in schools - the religious ethos and the fact that enrolment policies are Catholic-first.  We had a meeting yesterday with some schools in Lucan, and it seems it is effectively the case, by design or otherwise, that one school has one racial identity while another school has a different racial identity.  There is an African community whose children are graduating from one type of school and a white community whose children are graduating from another.  What is the balance of rights?  When does the right of a school to have a religious ethos supersede the right of a community to integrate properly?  I have just come from a presentation given by the Integration Centre at which it was stated that school admission policies are a fundamental issue in our society.  When Peter Robinson recently made a comment about admission policies in Catholic-ethos schools, which I fundamentally agree with, he was criticised by both Nationalist parties.On the issue of social integration, there are some young men who apparently feel as though they missed out on the Troubles, looking at it as some kind of glorious past in which they wish they had been involved.  This is an issue of disempowerment.  With regard to the school system, I appreciate the comments of Mr. McDonald, who said he is not sure how he feels about integrated schooling.  Could other people expand on the discussion on schooling and ethos and how this does not lend itself to a more integrated society?It is fantastic that visitors are here, and they are very welcome.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the delegates.  It is great to hear of the great work they are doing and to learn about the marching tradition.  I have family in Cavan and Monaghan, where bands and parading are more common than in Dublin.  People where I am from, Dublin, regard the whole marching practice as a complete and total oddity.  That is not a reference to either side of the community.  From an outside perspective, it seems to be a very strange tradition.  It is one about which people from my area need to learn more.From an outsider's perspective, I have always assumed we were dealing with two minorities in Northern Ireland, a nationalist minority within Northern Ireland and a Unionist minority within the wider all-Ireland context.  Both minorities have insecurities, and culture they feel they must celebrate and promote.  I understand that.Let me consider the profile of the areas in which the delegates work.  I always make this point because many of the images I saw from the flashpoint areas, such as those from the early summer or those from London, are similar to those from the very disadvantaged area of the inner city where I used to teach.  I refer to disaffected, disempowered young people looking for something to get excited about and to become empowered by.  Is the problem essentially one that arises in poorer or working-class areas?  While we are dealing with sectarianism and people's desire to reinforce a culture they feel may be under threat, is poverty not a central element of the problem?As the Parades Commission deals with various communities, is it potentially dangerous to designate them as Nationalist or Unionist, albeit unintentionally?  Is the commission very aware of this?  While integration and mutual understanding are very important in the longer term, do the delegates find themselves being very careful not to regard a particular area as having a certain religious or cultural background, which practice would effectively stigmatise that area and make any sort of religious or cultural tolerance almost impossible?I congratulate the commission on its work.  There is much more for us to learn.  I will be interested in the delegates' work over the next ten years as the anniversaries occur.  I was very taken by a documentary I saw on the beginning of the Troubles.  It showed how the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising began to stir emotions on either side of the divide.  This was one of a range of events in this regard in the mid-1960s.  Are the delegates keenly aware of this and of the importance and power of such occurrences?We very much appreciate the delegates' attendance and certainly learned a great deal from their presentation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Tánaiste and his team for attending the committee meeting.  Will the Tánaiste expand on the statement he made on the impact of bank lending policy by our two pillar banks on business in Northern Ireland with regard to the insecurity of the euro and the perceived flight of deposits from the Southern side of the Border to the Northern side?  What impact would a discussion on this have on the recapitalisation of our banks?Will the Tánaiste outline any discussions which took place on the ongoing security situation and the worrying rise in dissident activity?  This forum has had much discussion on the commemorative process we will go through in the coming years, with a presentation from the Parades Commission at our previous meeting.  We are very sensitive to the potential for divisive emotions to arise in the coming ten years.  However, there is also the potential for great coming together in celebration and I am intrigued and encouraged by the discussion taking place on tourism and the potential positive effects of these commemorations.  I would appreciate if the Tánaiste expanded on these points.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank our guests for their interesting contributions.  I think what people appreciate from sports people is honesty.  Jason Sherlock was my favourite Dublin player because he was a very honest player, and even though I am not really a rugby fan, it is also why Brian O'Driscoll is a favourite of mine.  I am trying to think of an honest soccer player.  Kevin Kilbane was mentioned earlier and he was a very honest player.  Fans always respond to honesty so we have to be honest in what we say.I was at the integration centre's pre-budget launch a couple of weeks ago and Fintan O'Toole was saying that we in the South have a terrible history of being completely unable to deal with difference, and that we have a history of incarcerating people who are different that is worse than any other state in the world.  That legacy remains today.  I grew up in a house in Dublin where rugby was a game played by people who went to private schools.  My father taught in a school which famously expelled Liam Brady for playing soccer.  I go to GAA matches a lot and I hear some of the pretty poisonous things said about some of the very small minority of ethnic players who play in Croke Park and a level of homophobia which is absolutely outrageous.  We have a problem and it is not just a Northern Irish thing.  We have a problem across the island with difference and with embracing it.The strides that have been made by the IFA are remarkable.  I have never been to Windsor Park.  I would appreciate an invitation and we would all like to go to a game at some point and see it at first hand.  The atmosphere has changed completely from what I can see on the TV screen.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes it is a good suggestion.  Mr. Ringland mentioned earlier that there is a potential for having two soccer teams on this island which would almost be exclusively from one religious background or the other.  I would defend the right of somebody whose particular personal identity fits in more with the Republic of Ireland team than with Northern Ireland to choose the former.  However, if this is being manipulated by a particular association, that has to be rooted out and challenged.My view of the Celtic and Rangers issue is that there are two very well resourced soccer teams in Scotland that benefit commercially from sectarianism.  We even had a sports manufacturer promoting a jersey of one of those teams and its tag line was "Identify Yourself".  That is making money out of sectarianism.  I wonder if both sides in Glasgow deliberately target Irish players in order to promote their idea of being representative of one side or the other.  Racism and sectarianism makes money for people.  We have to be aware of that.Emblems and anthems were mentioned before, along with the problem of racism, sectarianism and political identity.  It is impossible to divorce politics from sport.  I wish we could, but we cannot, because once a person represents a place with some kind of border around it, then that is a political thing.  How do we address the issue of anthems and emblems in a way that empowers people and brings them along with us?  I go to many games in Ulster.  My wife is from Monaghan, God love her.  It is not an easy team to support, but we go to many county grounds in the North of Ireland and the anthem is played, and I find myself, as a Dublin person, wondering how embracing this is.  Then again, Mr. Ringland made the point about the anthem of the Irish rugby team, and there is a similar problem with the Irish Football Association.  Gerry Armstrong made reference to that recently, when he stated it is not necessarily as embracing to those of a Nationalist background when only one anthem is played.  How important is that, or is it a red herring?  Are there more fundamental problems that we need to deal with?I appreciate the presentations made and I want to thank Mr. Mullen for the work he does on eliminating racism.  Everybody probably knows at this stage, because I say it often enough, that I taught in a disadvantaged area in the north inner city of Dublin.  The problem I discovered is that if somebody is discriminated against every day of his or her life, as a working class person, then discrimination towards somebody else comes almost naturally, because there is a perception that somebody else is scrambling around for scarce resources.  It is about empowerment and education.  It is often more about fear of poverty than it is about instinctive racism.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chair and apologise for not being here for the start of the meeting.  I had to attend a presentation on another matter in which I have a particular interest.  I welcome the witnesses.Following on from what Deputy Crowe said, I am the grandson of an ex-prisoner who fought in the Civil War.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.  He escaped from jail and was on the run during the last the week of it and was then put back in.  He became a customs officer, bizarrely, having being an anti-treaty prisoner.  I always thought that was kind of funny.  Our family has always had a romantic view of that period.  What has come across in many of our discussions at this committee is the new generation and their romantic view of the Troubles, the murals and the stories.  Some of that has come from the tales of what happened inside prison.  I remember watching a documentary once because coming from Dublin I feel very removed from what happened in Northern Ireland in that period.  In that documentary one ex-prisoner said he missed being in prison because of the comradery, togetherness and sense of identity and that he was lost on the outside.I have two questions for the witnesses.  What can ex-prisoners do to guide the new generation who are becoming as entrenched and as sectarian in their views as possibly any generation previously?  That has come across at every meeting we have had with any group anywhere, that the new generation of 16 and 17 year olds are just as entrenched in these views as any generation previously and there is a sense that they missed out.  There seems to be a conflict in that there is a sense of identity in the context that there was a turf war and something in which they could have been engaged but they missed out on that period and they are almost trying to relive it.  How can ex-prisoners be part of the process to ensure that there is a level of understanding that it was not so glorious and that being in prison is not so romantic and there is a huge price to be paid?I was not here for the first part of the meeting to hear the witnesses' presentation  I accept that being in prison is a part of somebody's life and it does not contextualise the rest of their existence.  I hope to God that my five years' here will not contextualise the rest of my existence and that I will be able to go back into normal society and live a normal life at some stage.  This place, Dáil Éireann, has been described as an open prison.  The question is how we reconcile what we are all trying to achieve for ex-prisoners with how the victims' families feel.  Their emotions can still be raw.  It is difficult to marry these two expectations.  Families of victims feel they are still imprisoned to some extent, given that family members are missing.  This must be balanced with the justified expectation that someone can move on, gain employment and live a proper and fulfilled life in society.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate Deputy Tuffy on her election to the Chair.  I commend her predecessor, Deputy Hannigan, on a successful year as Chairman.  I welcome our guest, the Secretary of State and pay tribute to his Government's response to Bloody Sunday and the apology his Prime Minister gave in the House of Commons.  That meant a lot to the people of Derry.We were struck on our visits to Northern Ireland by the ongoing problem of sectarianism.  Although sectarianism is classless, its most overt and violent interfaces are in areas of social disadvantage.  In regard to the poverty alleviation measures being considered for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State spoke about public housing and education.  It is believed that sectarianism is hardening among younger people who never witnessed the Troubles, feel they missed out and are looking for a sense of empowerment.  How is the UK Government engaging with the authorities in Northern Ireland in this regard and what role can integrated education play?We recently met the families bereaved by the Monaghan bombings.  We met some brave, articulate and inspirational people but they feel let down by successive British Governments over the past 40 years.  The Oireachtas is powerless to assist them without co-operation from the Secretary of State's Government.  They want access to State papers and information on the background to the events that led to the death of their loved ones.  Those wounds will never heal unless co-operation is forthcoming from the British authorities.  We have come very far in terms of relations between North and South, among the various communities in the North and between this country and Britain but a number of issues remain outstanding.  Much has been done to heal the wounds of Bloody Sunday but this is an ongoing issue for those affected by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, who believe there is an unnecessary obstacle in the way of their healing.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the panel for its presentation and excellent work.  I acknowledge those in the Gallery who have an interest in this field, some of whom have suffered a great deal.  I can think of nothing worse than losing a loved one and not having the finality of a burial.I was taken by the sensitivity with which the presentation was made.  I wish to ask about the criteria the commission uses to investigate cases.  Nine of the 16 cases listed have been resolved satisfactorily.  The panel might not be in a position to answer my question, but are there families who do not accept the commission's criteria as regards the use of evidence and further criminal investigations?  There could be other cases of disappeared persons that do not fall under the commission's remit.  The bulk of the seven outstanding cases date from the early 1970s.  As the years go by, how more difficult does an investigation get in terms of the people who have information and the deterioration of remains?  If the commission is to last for another ten, 15 or 20 years, will longer periods impact on its work?One case seems to involve work based in France.  What level of co-operation has the commission had with other jurisdictions?Unfortunately, I must ask a question that we always ask about funding, given the current economic situation in Ireland and the UK.  As the commission's work is important and sensitive, I hope that its funding and access to resources have not been impacted negatively.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Mr. Murray might not be in a position to answer this question.  Are there other cases, possibly outside his remit, in which the families are not comfortable with the idea of leaving aside a criminal investigation?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Chairman on his election and I thank Deputy Tuffy for all her work.  I am a Dublin based TD and I cannot pretend to know a whole lot about the situation in Northern Ireland, although I am trying to learn.  It would appear to me that the economy is disproportionately reliant on the public sector.  There has been a huge amount of public sector investment as part of the peace process.  Austerity and the shrinkage of the purchasing power of individuals are having a disproportionate effect on Northern Ireland when compared with anywhere else in the UK.  Can the witnesses comment on that public sector and private sector balance?  How is it a challenge?  Where is the growth potential in Northern Ireland for the private sector?  I have always worked in the public sector as a teacher, and now as a public representative.  I have since learned more about the demands, constraints and challenges of business than I ever had before.  Employment is something that we all worry about.  Do the witnesses feel that the balance in Northern Ireland towards the public sector is evening out in a more positive way?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I apologise for being a little late.  Please feel free to interrupt if I ask a question that has been answered.  I am stunned by the figure showing that 56% of those aged between 17 and 25 years in Northern Ireland are not registered to vote.  I spoke to a trade unionist in Australia where voting is compulsory.  While I have never advocated compulsory voting, it could be a long-term strategy because the person with whom I spoke told me it worked in Australia.  Political systems gravitate towards those who tend to vote, namely, the middle class, the wealthy and older people.  Finance is never directed towards areas and age groups which do not use their franchise to the same extent.  Is there potential to have a conversation about moving towards an understanding of how different international electoral models have worked?  The trade unionist indicated that voter turnout in the most disadvantaged areas which was traditionally poor had changed completely and that the political system was moving towards meeting the needs of this section of society now that it was much more engaged.  I ask our guests to comment on this issue.   On the attitudes of young people to voting, I am involved in a project with transition year students in local secondary schools.  It is related to the constitutional convention and known as the "Convention in Your Classroom".  I find it remarkable that students in only one of the schools I have visited as part of the project are in favour of lowering the voting age.  They are all au fait with social issues and happy to voice opinions on them.  However, they told me that young people under the age of 18 years did not understand or have an interest in political issues, although they tended to be more in tune with what was going on when they reached 18 years.   I was surprised that young people of 16 and 17 years were not eager to get involved in politics and have their voices heard.  Perhaps there is a disconnect between them and the political system.  The problem that arises when the political system tries to fill this gap is the contamination effect created by political parties becoming involved in voter registration.  There is a danger that politicisation will take on a party political dimension.   I am not sure if the issue of integrated schooling has been discussed.  The committee has received a number of presentations on the issue and I am aware the various churches are not keen on the idea.  We also received a presentation from loyalist community leaders, one of whom was strongly opposed to the idea of integrated schooling.  While the Republic does not have a great record on integrated schooling, we are moving towards a model of diverse school patronage.  Is the fact that children from different religions do not attend the same schools part of the problem in the North?    On the most recent violence and the discovery that 13 year old children were involved, time and again we have heard that those in their mid-teens and early 20s have no idea what happened during the Troubles and have a sense that they missed out on some of the action.  I am not trying to be dismissive or insulting, but that is the feedback we received from some community leaders.  I ask the delegation to comment.  Literacy, knowledge and learning are surely the most fundamental building blocks for anyone to be able to engage in the labour market or improve himself or herself in education.  The statistics for literacy in the North are probably similar to those in the South, especially for young men who have a difficulty in this regard.  Perhaps the delegation might comment.   The sexualisation and commercialisation of young women is not a problem exclusive to Northern Ireland or the Republic.  Having taught in a primary school for girls for 11 years, it is my view that young girls' sense of themselves and their place in society has regressed.  They are very much aware of their sexual power at a much earlier age.  Commercial interests demand that childhood be shortened in order that they can make money out of children as commercial entities.  A 12 year old who should have five or six years of childhood left is now deciding which boy band member she fancies, which make-up she should wear and what colour her hair should be.  Does the delegation wish to comment on the sexualisation of young women and the fact that they are contextualising themselves in terms of their sexual power?  I find that women and young girls are in a less positive place than they were ten, 15 or 20 years ago when, for example, Mary Robinson was elevated to the Presidency.  I do not know if the organisations have tapped into that area or if they have a comment  on it.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to contribute.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank our guests for their contributions and apologise for my late arrival. In the context of a presentation made to it previously, the committee was informed that the majority of young people between the ages of 18 and 26 in Northern Ireland are not even registered to vote. Does this give rise to a generational political disconnection and, therefore, does politics in the North still centre around the emotions which held sway in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s? Is it the case that the young people to whom I refer are so politically disconnected that they cannot even be bothered to register? I do not wish to say anything to offend anyone but I get the impression that there is not really any political imperative to overcome sectarianism. This is because sectarianism is the lifeblood of the political party system. Political parties in the North identify themselves along particular lines of national identity and, therefore, overcoming sectarianism is not in anyone's political interest. Will our guests indicate how they believe the political designation within the Assembly is working? Is it time to re-examine the position? I understand the reason behind the inclusion of that designation at the outset but is it not giving rise to a situation whereby, as someone indicated to me, the Assembly is functioning in a dysfunctional way?  We do not have integrated education in the Republic of Ireland. We have a long way to go before we reach a position where there might be a semblance of integrated education for people from different backgrounds. Education in the Republic is very socially divisive and I presume it is religiously divisive in the North. At a recent meeting in Stormont, it was explained to me that an issue arises with regard to working class Protestants and Catholics. I was informed that working class Catholic children who attend second level Catholic schools are six times more likely to reach third level than are their working class Protestant counterparts. Mr. Sheridan referred to a different statistic in the context of working class males. Perhaps our guests could provide some clarification on the matter. Given the level of emphasis placed on issues such as flag protests, policing, national identity, sectarianism, etc., is there a tendency to overlook matters such as social disadvantage and political disconnection?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The statistics indicate that a small majority of 18 to 26 year olds are not registered to vote.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The figure was in the region of 52%. That might be incorrect but there is certainly a large cohort whose members are not registered.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That to which we are referring is having an effect on the way politics is run.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. Everyone here is in agreement on the importance of this project. What practical steps can this committee take to advance the project? Is there a letter the committee could write or a representation we could make on behalf of the project? Who should such a letter or representation be made to? I am interested in the practical steps that could be taken to move the process forward. Everyone here believes in the validity of the project and is supportive of it. How can this committee be of practical help?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was something like that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for attending. One reason I was looking forward to this conversation was that, in the northern context, we believed this committee could determine how it could be of benefit in the educational sphere. The Minister has touched on many of the issues already. When analysing some of the areas we have been to and some of the issues that underpin sectarian tensions in the North with a view to overcoming them, education arose time and again as the great liberator, the one thing that will help youths and others who have experienced conflict to bounce back, regardless of their circumstances. How can we be of benefit to the institutions in the North? Can we share experiences, particularly regarding educational disadvantage? Conflict tends to happen in areas of social and economic deprivation and tends to be something that poorer people engage in. Particularly in the North, victims have tended to be from a lower socioeconomic status. Will the Minister elaborate on literacy, oral language skills, numeracy and the area-based strategies that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is trying to roll out in the South? I wish to ask about the capacity to share experience in respect of areas of the North that are mirrored in the South, and areas where there is deeply entrenched disadvantage. We must examine the capacity to empower parents. The problem with schooling is that children do not live in schools. There is a limit to what a teacher and a school can achieve in giving children basic skills to survive in life. It is a question of empowering parents also. The tragedy with the Irish education system, both in the North and South, is that schools are used as an enforcer of identity, not just as educational institutions. Children are sent to a particular school because it espouses the identity with which their parents feel most comfortable. Parents feel their child's identity can be enhanced in the school, and this is almost the priority. We have had an interesting discussion on the motivation of Catholic and Protestant parents in respect of their children. There is deep suspicion regarding integrated schooling. I noted this on both sides of the divide in the North. I found this interesting because, from the outside, integrated schooling might appear to be an obvious move to make. In the North, it is not as popular. What capacity have we to share experiences? What can we learn from what is happening in the schools system and wider community in Northern Ireland? The Minister referred to the preschool experience. How can we learn from the Northern Ireland experience?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the delegation. I have learned a great deal from the presentation. Mr. Colgan spoke about new approaches and widening the body's remit. I would like to put on record some of my concerns in regard to the long-term goals of what the body is trying to achieve and what we are trying to achieve. One of the biggest threats to the stability of peace in Northern Ireland, the Border regions and wider afield is from dissident republicans. A profound issue on the north side of Dublin, which is in my constituency, is the growing simplistic definition or analysis of what the Northern situation is about and dissident republican organisations tapping into disconnected young people in this regard. There are issues of educational disadvantage tied into this, including economic disconnection and so on. It is very easy for dissident republicans in the South to present a simplistic and one-sided view of the political reality in the North. This pushes mainstream republicans and Nationalists further to the green side, which makes mainstream unionism and mainstream loyalism even more nervous. Other issues affecting my constituency include local authority staff, whose responsibility it is to remove political graffiti, being threatened, an increase in paramilitary style events and an increasing mobilisation of dissident republicans in Dublin and, I assume, elsewhere. The first ceasefire took place in 1994. For young men now in their 20s and 30s, this is a distant memory, if they recall it at all. When meeting community groups from Northern Ireland, they expressed the concern that 17 and 18 year olds who have no memory of what the Troubles were like but who have heard stories about it from particular people may feel they have missed out and may be trying to relive some of the glories of the past.Talking to someone who has been through the Troubles and who may have emerged enlightened from a period of detention or what he or she has done or experienced is easier than talking to a young person who has not been through such an experience. I wonder if there is potential for greater connectivity with different parts of the country, not only the Border regions, with a view to addressing the growing threat posed by people who take a simplified view of the politics of the North. Disaffected young people may be easily politicised and radicalised by this particularly dangerous view, which is growing in popularity. I am especially concerned about this issue given what took place in the North in the past. This meeting is a perfect forum for acknowledging the issue. What are the witnesses' views on this matter? Has it been discussed by the Special EU Programmes Body? Could the SEUPB offer practical solutions or engage in outreach on this issue? As the representative of a constituency in central Dublin, I hope to get a perspective on what the joint committee can achieve. I do not pretend that particular emotions have been consigned to the past or that everyone has moved on and we all take an enlightened view. A whole new generation, not only in Northern Ireland or the Border counties but also in my constituency, is making life very difficult for local communities and could make life difficult for this island, North and South, if we do not engage proactively to address the issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Mr. Saint-Amans. One comment he made earlier that interested me was that the OECD's position was that low direct taxes are pro-growth. Could he expand on that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Mr. Saint-Amans made the welcome statement that Ireland is not a tax haven and has said that part of what he wants to do is to improve transparency and the automatic exchange of information. How difficult will that process be?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does Mr. Saint-Amans think the date of 2014 can be achieved?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does he think that the new standard can be up and running by 2014?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He made a point earlier about the balance that must be struck between not impinging on sovereignty and neutralising schemes that are used. It sounds like a pretty difficult balance to strike. A previous question was asked about why this was at the forefront of the international agenda. How difficult would it be to strike that balance between national sovereignty and neutralising schemes and to keep this issue at the forefront of the international agenda?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate where Mr. Saint-Amans is coming from. My point was more about the politics of these things rather than the sovereignty. I thank him for his interaction. I appreciate his comments very much.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It could be called double Dutch.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ms O'Brien has said the majority of studies indicate the effective corporate tax rate here is generally very close to 12.5%, as there are few deductions and reliefs within our corporate tax regime.  Why is there such a focus on Ireland's corporate tax rate internationally if the majority of studies show this?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Perhaps Professor Stewart might also contribute on this point.  The sense we get is that there is international pressure to give the impression that Ireland is a tax haven, yet when we asked that question of Pascal Saint-Amans when he made a presentation to us, he said Ireland was most definitely not a tax haven.However, he could not actually point to any jurisdiction that technically was a tax haven, which did not help us in dispelling that myth. It appears that a geopolitical game is being played, with countries trying to tarnish the reputation of others to give the impression that there is something underhand or shadowy going on in order to gain an advantage for themselves in attracting jobs and inward investment. Would Ms O'Brien or Professor Stewart buy into that theory or they be in a position to even comment on it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask Professor Stewart to expand on that point a little more for the benefit of the committee.  The term "tax haven" is a very dangerous one because it can mean different things to different people.  When Professor Stewart says the Netherlands is a bigger tax haven than Ireland, that implies Ireland is a tax haven, if only to a degree.  I ask him to clarify what he means by that comment.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The sub-committee is discussing this issue because a number of multinational companies located here have been the subject of international attention.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uilig as ucht an fáilte a chur said romham um thráthnóna. I welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who have come from Mosney and Portlaoise. I am sure I recognise at least one person from Hatch Hall and representatives of SPIRASI. I have been asked by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to respond to this motion by supporting the Government amendment, which states:To delete all words after 'That Seanad Éireann' and substitute the following:"recognising that –-«the current system of direct provision has been in place for 14 years;-«that the Minister and the Minister of State in the Department of Justice and Equality having visited several centres both agree on the need to review the current system; and-«that a key concern identified by those working in the sector is the length of time people spend in the system with over half of the residents being in the system for over four years;welcomes the commitments in the statement of Government priorities 2014 - 2016 to:-«establish an independent working group to report to the Government on improvements with the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers; and-«to reduce the length of time the applicant spends in the system through the establishment of a single applications procedure, to be introduced by way of a protection Bill as a matter of priority.I welcome this opportunity to respond to the points raised in this Private Member's motion and to speak more generally about the subject in order to assist Members gain a fuller understanding of the issues involved. It is no secret that I personally have many difficulties with the direct provision system as it currently operates. I have described the system as inhumane and I do not resile from that description. I am entitled to hold that view even if it may conflict with the views of others in government. A debate on this subject is long overdue and is now taking place at a serious level not just because of what I have been saying but because of the long and persistent questioning of the system by NGOs, international bodies and by many Members of the Oireachtas, especially Members of Seanad Éireann. I congratulate members of the media who have been highlighting this issue. The House will know from recent media reports that there is an ongoing series of protests in asylum accommodation centres. I want to make it clear that while I fully respect the rights of residents to protest, I cannot condone the targeting of individuals working in certain direct provision centres or the stopping of people going about their lawful work. I have visited a number of centres and while my concerns about the system are unabated, I fully accept that persons there, as well as in the Reception and Integration Agency, are working on a day-to-day basis in the interests of the residents and bring a high level of commitment to their work. This system has been in operation for 14 years and no click of my fingers is going to end it immediately. The system is a creature of Government and depending on the outcome of the review it will require Government approval to change it. Nonetheless, I can say to this House and to those outside it that change can take place more rapidly than anyone previously thought through the working group review mechanism referred to in the Government counter motion. Quite apart from these political developments, there has been activity on the legal front, as already mentioned in the debate. The six-week hearing in the CA and TY judicial review proceedings in the High Court challenging, inter alia, the legality and constitutionality of the direct provision system ended on 28 July 2014 and a reserved judgment is awaited. This judgment may also affect the future of the system. My job as Minister of State is to ensure the commitment to a review is honoured. An important first step in setting up this working group will be convening a roundtable consultation tomorrow morning, 18 September. The purpose of this roundtable consultation is twofold. First, it is to engage with non-governmental organisations active in the area to enable them to outline the key issues for them with the State's current arrangements for asylum seekers. Second, the output of the consultation will be used to inform in more detail the terms of reference of the working group. A number of themes and issues which are reflective of the current debate on the State's arrangements have been identified for discussion at the roundtable consultation. These include the material needs of applicants in direct provision, including the direct provision allowance and exceptional needs payments, limitations on the time persons spend in direct provision, education and delays in the international protection determination process. It will also address the issue of the right to work. In other words, all the calls made on the Government in Senator Rónán Mullen's motion can be addressed through this working group in a calm, considered and detailed way. I expect the group will have three months in which to come up with its recommendations and I want to stick to that. Nobody wants a group that sits for six or nine months. I believe three months is a realistic target for a report to be issued. Regardless of the changes that need to be made to the way we deal with asylum seekers, I need to acknowledge that the direct provision system has enabled the housing and other needs of over 51,000 asylum seekers to be met since it was introduced. No one has ever been made homeless. Nonetheless, people spend too long in direct provision centres, for which there are very many reasons. Approximately 50% of persons in the direct provision system have judicial review applications pending, are the subject of deportation orders or are seeking leave to remain in the State for non-protection reasons. A recent examination of cases in the direct provision system suggested that in the overwhelming majority of cases in the system longer than four years - the cut-off date suggested in Senator Rónán Mullen's motion - the applicants or their family members have legal proceedings pending, having exhausted all the processes in the protection system. With regard to the protection process more generally, the Government counter motion acknowledges the commitment to introduce a separate protection Bill to establish a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection. This reform will simplify and streamline existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. It will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time that applicants spend in the direct provision system. The aim is to have the Bill passed through the Oireachtas by Easter 2015, with the heads of the Bill to be approved and published in January. The independent working group process which I commend to the House is a sensible one. It allows for necessary change to be identified and managed effectively without the dangers which would be generated by peremptory actions. I acknowledge that the system of direct provision was created to avert a homelessness crisis. It is important any outcome of a review of the system does not serve to re-create the crisis which led to its establishment in the first place. Many suggestions to reform the direct provision system have an underlying assumption that numbers coming into the State seeking asylum will continue to fall and that it is a static not a dynamic issue. So far in 2014, asylum claims are running 40% higher than in 2013. I have been heartened, as I am sure many in this House will have been, by the public outcry on the issue, which is in marked contrast to some of the emotions that may have been witnessed ten years ago. We are on the side of public sympathy on the issue. I have been invigorated and energised by the debate that has taken place.As part of my role as Minister of State in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht I have responsibility for commemorations as well. The Proclamation we will be discussing, celebrating and commemorating in two years' time weighs heavily on my shoulders, as it does on the Members of this House. We must be honest with ourselves. We cannot commemorate, celebrate and acknowledge that document if we do not sort out issues such as direct provision. We cannot have a republic that has lesser children. While the system remains in its current form, we are destined to have within our country children who are considered to be lesser. We cannot stand over that and I will not stand over it. I have been visiting centres throughout the country. I am mindful of the comments that have been made about issues around trafficking, sexual assault, rape and torture that people within the system have suffered. I met the expert team in Beaumont Hospital who have confirmed this to me and stated their concerns about the people they have been treating from the reception centre in Balseskin in Finglas, who after a period of treatment then move to a centre in places such as County Mayo. That is not the best care for people who have suffered such trauma and abuse in the country from where they have come. Many issues must be addressed. People have also discussed the issue of education. I am a great believer that education is a great liberator. No matter what happens in one's life, whatever trauma or setback one gets, such as losing a job, a relationship break-up or having to travel from one country to another, education will always help one to bounce back. We must ensure within the working group that the issue of access to education is addressed. The comments of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in this regard are to be welcomed. I think everybody across this House has said that this is not a party political issue, that it is an issue on which we can work to achieve together. I will return to this House when the report from the expert group is issued, and from there we will have a process to achieve a system that collectively we can be proud of and not one of which we are ashamed.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«This evening's debate provides an opportunity for me to state clearly that the Government is committed to ensuring equality of access to educational and other opportunities for persons with disabilities and special educational needs. As Minister of State with special responsibility for new communities, culture and equality, I am particularly pleased to speak to this motion on what is a cross-departmental issue affecting a number of Departments, including mine and those responsible for health, education, children and youth affairs. While I have no direct role in issues relating to educational provision and the organisation of the education system, I do have an oversight role in respect of the national disability strategy, which is a whole-of-government approach to advancing the social inclusion of all people with disabilities. The Government remains fully committed to the full implementation of this strategy, which brings together the community and voluntary sectors to work with statutory agencies and Departments to improve the lives of people with disabilities. In the area of education, the Government has demonstrated that commitment with action. It is important to note that some €1.3 billion will be spent in support of children with special educational needs this year, which is an increase in expenditure of 43% over the 2008 figure of €904 million. If I recall correctly, the figure for 2004 was some €450 million. Therefore, there has been quite an increase since then. The provision being made for special educational needs this year is in line with expenditure in recent years and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut. The current level of investment represents approximately 15% of the education budget of €8.3 billion of the Department of Education and Skills. The Government has been resolutely committed to protecting the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of expenditure which has been prioritised above most other areas by the Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public expenditure. The level of resources devoted to supporting children with special educational needs has been protected, and in some areas in 2014 it has been increased to take into account increased demand and demographic growth.This evening's debate also provides me with an opportunity to reassure all parents of children with disabilities and special educational needs that their children will continue to receive the supports necessary to ensure they can access education appropriate to their needs and abilities. The Department of Education and Skills provides for a continuum of support to ensure that all children with special needs can access education, whether in a mainstream class with additional supports, in a special class attached to a mainstream school, or, for a child who may require specialist interventions, as a special school placement. On the issue of special needs assistants or SNAs, in December 2013 the Government announced that it was increasing the number of SNAs available for allocation to schools to reflect both demographic growth and increased demand for SNA support. The provision has been increased by 390 posts. At the end of the 2013-14 school year 10,656 SNA posts had been allocated to schools, which is a greater number of posts than at any previous time. For example, at the end of the 2011-12 school year there were 10,487 SNAs, while at the end of the 2010-11 school year there were 10,320 SNAs. So far in this school year, 10,900 SNAs have been allocated to schools. Again, this is the highest level of SNA allocation that we have ever had. These extra posts confirm the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who needs SNA support will receive access to such support. I am aware that references are sometimes made to cuts to SNAs both in this House and in the media. I am therefore grateful for this opportunity to put on the record of this House that not only has there not been a reduction in the number of SNA posts provided to schools, but the Government has substantially increased the number of SNA posts available. Some schools may have received a reduced SNA allocation because a pupil with special needs has left the school or because pupils have declining care needs as they grow older. This should not be represented as a cut. Additionally, where such posts are freed up they are then allocated to other schools that have enrolled new pupils with special educational care needs. Parents who may have been frightened by reports of cuts need have no fears that their children will be denied access to an SNA. The cap of 10,575 posts which was introduced by the previous Government in 2010 has been increased to 10,965 SNA posts by this Government. The Department of Education and Skills recently issued a new circular to schools about the SNA scheme in order to provide clarity on the role of SNAs in schools in accordance with the recommendation contained in recently received National Council for Special Education policy advice and the recommendations contained in the Department's value for money and policy review of the SNA scheme. The NCSE is also developing an information booklet for parents on the SNA scheme, which is expected to be completed and published shortly and which will provide clear guidance and information for parents on the role and purpose of the scheme. As a Deputy in the House I have been involved in compiling a report on the future role of the SNA in Irish education. Senator Mary Moran has kindly agreed to continue that research and to present it to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection in due course. The Government has also increased the overall number of resource teaching posts available to schools in recent years. Some 480 additional resource teaching posts were provided for the 2012-13 school year and an additional 480 posts have been made available for 2014-15 in order to meet growing demand from schools for low-incidence special educational needs support. This brings the number of resource and learning support teachers in mainstream schools to more than 11,000 at the moment, which is more than at any time previously. This can be compared with 10,305 posts for the 2012-13 school year and 9,950 posts for the 2011-12 year. No reduction was made to the amount of resource teaching time allocated to schools per pupil in the 2013-14 school year, and no reduction is being made for the 2014-15 school year. There are now more additional resource and learning support teachers in our schools than at any time previously. The general allocation model, which allocates more than 4,200 learning support and resource teachers to all primary schools, is now to be updated annually based on the number of mainstream teaching posts in schools in the previous year, and will therefore reflect growth in school size. As the number of pupils being assessed as having low-incidence or more severe levels of disability has also been rising, this frees up some resources from schools' general allocations to provide to other children who have learning support needs in schools. In addition to SNA and teaching resources which are provided to schools to support children with special needs, a range of other supports are made available to schools to facilitate access to education for pupils with disabilities. These include modified school buildings, enhanced capitation payments for special schools and special classes, a home tuition scheme, specialist transport arrangements and assistive technology support. In addition, more than 1,100 teaching posts in special schools will continue to be provided for in the coming school year. The National Council for Special Education also opened 132 new special classes for September of this year, which means that there are now more than 860 special classes. On the issue of policy advice, Members of this House will be aware that the NCSE recently provided the Department of Education and Skills with a comprehensive report on supporting students with special educational needs in schools. In its report the NCSE acknowledged the State's significant investment in providing supports for students with special educational needs over recent decades, which has transformed the ability of schools to educate such pupils. This report makes clear that there are many aspects of the current system that parents and schools are happy with. However, the report also makes it clear that there are disadvantages to the current system, which can create an inequitable distribution of resource teaching hours whereby each school receives the same general allocation based on school size, regardless of the needs of the school's pupil population. This is an important point. It also recommended that supports be allocated to schools to support pupils on the basis of their needs and without the necessity for a diagnosis of a particular disability in order to gain access to an educational resource. A substantial component of the current model is based on the availability of a diagnosis of special educational need, but, as has been noted by some Members of this House, access to professionals who can make this diagnosis is not always readily available to all students. Some families can afford to pay for private assessments and, where eligible, these students can immediately access additional teaching resources. The allocation of additional State educational resources should not depend on a parent's ability to pay for professional assessments or proximity to HSE supports. Following on from the publication of the NCSE report, the Minister for Education and Skills asked the NCSE to develop proposals for a new allocation model, and in June of this year the NCSE published its report, A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs. This report recommends that the Department and the NCSE develop a new way to allocate additional teaching resources to schools, taking into account the educational profile of each school and without the need for students to get assessments in order to receive resources. The NCSE has also advised that under the present system there is a risk that children are being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes rather than for health reasons. The report also notes that there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every category of special educational need. The current system allocates the same level of support for students within certain categories of special educational needs even though one student may have a greater need for support than another with the same disability. A diagnosis of a disability in itself does not necessarily inform the level of need for additional teaching support. A significant portion of additional learning support resources is also allocated to schools on the basis of enrolment, in post-primary schools, or the number of class teachers, in primary schools, and is not linked to the level of need for such support in schools. The report recommended that schools be given an allocation to provide pupils with such resources based on their individual needs, taking into account the overall profiled need of each school. The report recommended that sufficient time be allowed to develop the new allocation model and for further consultation to take place with the education stakeholders before any proposed new model is implemented in schools. This process is necessary to build confidence that the new system will be equitable, transparent and efficient in delivering resources to students with special educational needs. The Department of Education and Skills is currently collecting school-based data which could support the development of a proposed new allocation model. It has also invited education partners and stakeholders to make written submissions in relation to the NCSE proposals for a new allocation model, following which consultations will take place with the partners. The Department of Education and Skills will continue to provide the resources that can ensure that all children with special educational needs avail of education. At the same time, it will also plan to ensure that existing levels of service provision can be maintained. Finally, the Department of Education and Skills will consider how to make improvements to the system and how to make accessing the system easier for parents and children who require supports in schools. On preschool provision, the Government remains committed to supporting the participation of children with additional needs in preschool services. A number of Departments and their agencies are contributing to this area, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, and the HSE. A clear indication of the Government's determination to further strengthen provision in this area is the inclusion of a specific commitment in Better Outcomes: Brighter Futures, the new integrated policy framework for children and young people to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream preschool and early years settings. An interdepartmental team of senior officials is finalising a report on how best to make progress in this area. The team, consisting of representatives from the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Health and Education and Skills, as well as the HSE, is due to report shortly on this issue to the cross-sectoral team on children's disability issues. The report will inform the development of policy into the future and ensure we will have a co-ordinated and consistent approach across government to supporting the participation of children with additional needs in early years settings. Progress is also being made in ensuring early years practitioners have the appropriate knowledge, skills and disposition to support children with additional needs within preschool settings. This has been facilitated through such measures as the learner fund which is being supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to support early years practitioners in meeting new minimum qualification requirements for the free preschool year. Other initiatives include the development of programmes such as the special purpose award to include children with additional needs which is offered by Mary Immaculate College in Limerick. The Department of Education and Skills recently received funding through the dormant accounts fund to support the further expansion of education and training opportunities in special needs education for early years practitioners. The Department has also initiated a review of education and training programmes leading to qualifications in early years care and education. A major focus of the review will be the extent to which graduates of such programmes have been adequately prepared to work in early years settings and to meet the many challenges that arise in such settings, including catering for children with additional needs. On psychological services, I can advise the House that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments, either directly through the Department's National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or, in cases where a NEPS psychologist is not available, through a panel of private practitioners maintained under the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, which is administered by the NEPS. In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, the NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution-focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. The NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. In a period of severe financial strictures the numbers of educational psychologists employed with the NEPS service has grown. For example, the number of whole-time equivalent posts increased from 158 at the beginning of 2011 to the current level of 169. It is envisaged that the number of educational psychologists will be further increased to 173 in the current academic year. The Government is committed, within available resources, to the provision and development of health related therapy services for children with special needs. Health related therapy supports such as speech and language and occupational therapies are accessed through the Health Service Executive's primary care services and its disability services. The HSE has introduced a number of initiatives to ensure these therapy services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible and on the basis of prioritised need. The measures include therapists increasing clinic-based work instead of domiciliary work and, where possible, providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one, setting. In addition, structures, training and supports are being provided for parents and carers in order that they can work to help to improve the child's speech and language skills. The HSE's national service plan 2013 provided for additional funding of €20 million to strengthen primary care services. It comprises more than €18.5 million for recruitment to fill over 260 primary care team posts and more than €1.4 million to support community intervention team development. The posts include 52 whole-time equivalent speech and language therapists, 51 of which have been filled. Recruitment to fill the remaining post is under way. With regard to disability services for children, the HSE has recognised the need to standardise the way in which these services are delivered. Therapy services for children are being reconfigured into geographically-based multidisciplinary teams as part of the HSE's progressing disability services for children and young people 0-18 years programme. The objective of the programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services in order that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they attend or the nature of their disability. There is a national structure to underpin this change management programme, with national, regional and local implementation groups in place. All elements of the implementation structure include multi-stakeholder involvement, including representatives from the Department of Education and Skills and its relevant service strands, including the National Educational Psychology Service and the National Council for Special Education. An additional €4 million has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the programme. This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts. As the programme is rolled out, it will ensure the resources available are used to best effect in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy for children in line with their prioritised needs. In particular, over time, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they receive their education services, will have equitable access to services based on their needs. On adult education provision, it should be noted that educational provision continues to be made for adults with disabilities or special educational needs after they leave school. Adults with disabilities have a range of options available to them in the higher and further education sectors. Some students choose to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings. While the Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs over 18 years, the Department of Education and Skills often allocates funding towards an educational component of such provision. This is generally transacted through the tuition hours scheme provided by education and training boards for local service providers, while funding is also provided for the national learning network for this purpose. Young adults with disabilities are eligible to access SOLAS funded mainstream services provided by the education and training boards. The ETB contract with 16 specialist training providers at 49 locations countrywide is to deliver training courses to people with disabilities who require more intensive support than would be available through non-specialist training provision. A range of specialist courses are available at two levels of training, introductory skills training and specific skills training, and include in-centre, employer-based and blended learning approaches to accommodate learners' training needs. These training courses lead to awards at levels 3 to 5 in the national framework of qualifications. Entry to specialist training is open to all persons with disabilities over 16 years of age. Programme duration may typically be up to 18 or 24 months, depending on programme type. Specialist training offers additional supports to learners which include individualised training and progression plans, literacy and numeracy support, longer training duration, adapted equipment, transport arrangements, enhanced programme content and an enhanced trainer-learner ratio. For students attending further and higher education institutions, funding to further and higher education institutions for the provision of services and supports for full-time students with disabilities is provided through the fund for students with disabilities, FSD. The Disability Access Route to Education, DARE, is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places at reduced points to school-leavers with disabilities. Eighteen higher education institutions are participating in the scheme. Core funding for access programmes is allocated each year as part of the overall budget of each designated higher education institution.This funding supports the provision of dedicated staff, services and supports for students with disabilities as well as for mature students and school leavers from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Every further and higher education institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act 2005. In addition, many institutions have a dedicated disability support service with trained disability officers, learning support officers and other specialist staff. The national plan for equity of access to higher education, 2014-2016 Action Plan - Towards the Next National Access Plan, is currently being finalised by the national access office for the Department. The new plan will include actions and targets that ensure there is continued support for people with disabilities in accessing and participating in higher education. I wish to advise that the overall level of investment being provided annually will ensure that provision can continue to be made for the educational requirements of children and young adults with special educational needs. The combination of investment and supports provided will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to be wholly included within our education system.  The Government wishes to ensure that existing supports for children with special educational needs are maintained while also considering how we can improve our current support systems. While I am not in a position to anticipate any future budgetary decisions or considerations, I can, however, assure the House that the Government will continue to do everything possible to protect the provision of services for children and adults with disabilities or special educational needs and, where possible, to bring about improvements to services.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senator Burke for raising this very important topic. He refers to the need for the Minister for Health to establish a task force with representatives from sports organisations, sports medicine bodies and primary and post primary schools in order to devise an appropriate education programme to improve awareness of sport-related concussion, its management and possible consequences among players, parents, coaches and medics. I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar. The issue of concussion wherever it occurs needs to be taken very seriously as it is a mild traumatic brain injury. It is important to also state that it is not just during sport that the dangers of concussion arise. While we have seen some very public examples of concussion at major sporting events recently, I do not think it would be helpful to focus just on sporting occasions. There is always a risk of injury, however small, in all aspects of normal day-to-day activities whether in school, while commuting, at home or in the workplace which can result in concussion. The management of concussion includes evaluation, removal from active participation, medical assessment of symptoms, physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve followed by a gradual return to participation. This is the case wherever it occurs, not just in sport. I would like to acknowledge the work of a number of sporting organisations which have been very proactive in raising awareness of the dangers of concussion and in developing guidance on concussion for participants, coaches, officials and others. However, in saying that, I also call on the sporting organisations to ensure that they are visibly implementing their own guidelines and doing whatever they can to ensure the health and safety of all of those participating in sport. Regular physical activity is one of the most important things anybody can do for his or her health. While the benefits are well known, we must also ensure that we do not discourage anybody from participating in sport and physical activity, either directly or as a volunteer, because of fears about sustaining injury or concerns about how to respond when in a position of authority or responsibility. As the Senator is aware from his participation in the recent Joint Committee on Health and Children hearings on the implications of concussion in sport, officials in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills recently started exploring the issue of concussion in school settings. The two Departments brought together a small group of relevant experts from key organisations to have an exploratory discussion about the implications of concussion and to identify current shortcomings in concussion awareness and responses. This is an opportunity to build on work already undertaken to develop a uniform approach to understanding and educating people about concussion and creating a better awareness about injury prevention, risk reduction as well as response and treatment for concussion. While this is a complex issue, initially officials in both Departments will continue to work together and with the group of experts from key organisations referred to earlier to progress the development and distribution of information materials to reiterate that the management of concussion includes evaluation, removal from active participation, medical assessment of symptoms, physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve, followed by a gradual return to participation. I believe that a singular process with the backing of all relevant stakeholders will be beneficial in encouraging everyone to understand the true importance and implications of concussion. In the deliberations on concussion, the need to explore further what more needs to be done to ensure that concussion is dealt with in a safe manner was recognised. This work will continue in partnership with the key stakeholders from the sporting organisations and the medical professions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The point is very well made by Senator Burke. This is an important issue which is not just relevant to sport but to schools and society generally. I will pass on the Senator's remarks to the Minister for Health.

Ba mhaith liom leanacht ar aghaidh ach ba mhaith liom a rá go mb'fhéidir go mba cheart dúinn comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit faoin dúshlán sin a thógáil chomh dáiríre sin nach raibh sé sásta an óráid seo a léamh amach, fiú, i mBéarla sa Seanad. The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, had intended to come to the House to speak on this matter but declined to do so because he had made a firm commitment not to speak English today as part of the Gaeilge 24 challenge. I am speaking on his behalf and that of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. The social housing strategy which is being finalised is being developed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, with input from key personnel in the Housing Agency and National Economic and Social Council, NESC. The strategy will provide the basis for an enhanced approach to social housing provision and contain clear actions to be taken to increase supply and, most importantly, reduce the numbers on waiting lists. The measures in the strategy will complement budget 2015 which provided for a multi-annual approach to the provision of social housing, with a considerable increase in Exchequer investment and proposals for innovative funding approaches to increase supply. The strategy will be submitted to the Government for approval in the coming weeks and published thereafter. As Senators will be aware, the specific provisions to be made in 2015 in respect of the various funding schemes and programmes, including the breakdown of the social housing investment programme, will be published in December in the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will then work with all local authorities to agree individual allocations across all social housing activities, especially in new building projects. This planning will be based, first and foremost, on social housing need in each area, taking account of projects local authorities have already commenced. Thanks to funding announced by the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in March this year, a local authority housing construction programme, with an associated cost of €68 million, has been initiated. The programme will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on housing waiting lists by 2016. A simultaneous announcement of a further €46 million in capital investment for approved housing bodies will provide for a total of 416 units of accommodation for people with special housing needs, including the elderly, persons with an intellectual or a physical disability and homeless persons. These investments marked the return to new mainstream social housing construction after a number of years in abeyance. The Senator has shown a particular interest in South Dublin County Council where funding of more than €5.3 million has been allocated under these programmes and is expected to deliver 32 units of accommodation. Social housing is a priority issue for the Government, as demonstrated in the investment in new housing infrastructure announced in budget 2015. The combined capital and current housing allocation for 2015 will result in an investment of almost €800 million and provide more than 7,500 new homes across a range of housing programmes. The net effect of new building activity under way and the further allocations to local authorities that will follow the publication of the social housing strategy and Revised Estimates Volume will be to produce a pipeline of new social housing which will stretch out on a multi-annual basis.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Senator's comments and will convey the case she made to the Minister. No one in either House or in government is under any illusion about the seriousness of the housing crisis in Dublin and nationwide. It is fair to use the label "crisis". The Government's response in the budget was substantial and the investment announced in public housing, the first such announcement in a long time, is a statement of its intent. I appreciate the Senator's comments and her motivation in making them. I will convey the points she made to the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I commend the Senators for bringing forward this Bill which the Government does not intend to oppose. I agree with the points made regarding the beauty and fragility of free speech and democracy. Some weeks ago I was stuck in traffic outside the Romanian embassy when I saw long queues of Romanians living in Ireland waiting to vote in the elections in their home country. It was to see people willing to queue for six or seven hours for the chance to cast their ballot. We in this county can sometimes be complacent regarding the nature of free speech and our capacity to engage in the democratic process. Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad. I certainly have changed my position since that referendum and am more appreciative of the richness of debate in this House and what it brings to the business of the Oireachtas. Senator Ivana Bacik will be delighted to hear it. This short Bill seeks to amend the Defamation Act 2009 on the relatively narrow issue of the bringing of defamation proceedings by corporate bodies under section 12 of the Act. The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, considers that the Bill as drafted is deficient and would require extensive further examination and amendment. On a preliminary examination, we have a number of substantial concerns which I will present in due course. The present legal position is that the Defamation Act provides, at section 12, that:The provisions of this Act apply to a body corporate as they apply to a natural person, and a body corporate may bring a defamation action under this Act in respect of a statement concerning it that it claims is defamatory whether or not it has incurred or is likely to incur financial loss as a result of the publication of that statement.This provision sought to recognise the full commercial and non-commercial importance of a body corporate's reputation and to protect that reputation against defamatory statements, even in situations in which it might be difficult to prove or to measure resulting financial loss. For example, it might be difficult if a company had recently started up or just entered a new market, or if the main impact of the defamatory publication was to make it difficult to recruit or retain staff or to cause distrust in relations with core partners such as banks, customers, or trade unions. Under section 12, a body corporate which is not involved in commerce is similarly entitled to protect its reputation against defamatory statements, regardless of whether it operates in the public or the private sector, even if it is not suffering identifiable financial loss. The 2009 Act also provides for a number of statutory defences to a defamation action - the defences of truth, absolute or qualified privilege, honest opinion and fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest. Having set out the current position, I would like to comment on the changes proposed by the Bill before the House. This legislation would amend just three sections of the Defamation Act 2009: section 12, which provides that bodies corporate can bring defamation proceedings; section 13, which allows for the Supreme Court, on appeal, to revise the amount of damages awarded for defamation in the High Court by a jury; and section 31, which lists various factors the court must take into account when deciding on an award of damages for defamation. All of the changes proposed in this Bill relate to the bringing of defamation proceedings by bodies corporate under section 12 of the 2009 Act. The central change in the Bill is the proposed new subsection 12(2), which would radically limit the damages that could be awarded to specified types of corporate bodies, in a defamation case, to a nominal €1. As the proposed changes to sections 13 and 31 are ancillary in nature, I will concentrate my remarks on the proposed changes to section 12. As I have indicated, the Minister considers that the Bill as drafted is deficient and would require extensive further examination and amendment. I will set out some of her reservations, which are based on a preliminary examination of this legislation. The Bill's central proposal is to impose a limit of €1 on the damages that could be awarded in a defamation case to any of the very wide range of bodies corporate listed in the proposed section 12(3). The text provides that a court may not even consider any higher award, irrespective of the nature and extent of the damage actually suffered. This radical proposed intervention would require very careful scrutiny, including with regard to its constitutionality. The Bill would impose this new limit on any body which falls into any of the extraordinarily broad and diverse list of categories set out in the proposed section 12(3). The Bill defines any body covered by this list as a "public body". We have serious concerns about the excessively broad scope of the list. I will explain those concerns briefly. The stated objective of the Bill is to limit the damages that public bodies can be awarded in defamation cases, apparently with a view to discouraging them from bringing defamation proceedings. The list proposed in section 12(3) seems to fundamentally confuse different sorts of public and corporate bodies. As a result, it includes in the Bill many bodies that do not seem relevant to the Bill's objectives. We have to bear in mind that the bodies we know as public bodies are a diverse mix, including bodies incorporated under the Companies Acts, under other statutes, or in some cases under charter. They include bodies which have corporate identity and entities which do not. Some of these bodies have commercial purposes or activities, while others are non-commercial. Many of our commercial State-sponsored bodies operate and compete in markets alongside private company competitors. I will give some non-exhaustive examples. The list includes bodies which are not corporate, which means they were never eligible to bring defamation proceedings under section 12 of the 2009 Act and are, therefore, not relevant to the purpose of this Bill. For example, the Departments of State, listed in the proposed section 12(3)(a) are not bodies corporate. Similarly, it is not clear that all of the diverse public health bodies listed in the proposed section 12(3)(h) would be bodies corporate. The list also includes bodies which are not public. That is a problem because a body that is included in the list is defined by section 12(2) of the Bill as a "public body". For example, the entities established by charter that are included in the proposed sections 12(3)(b) and 12(3)(g) are not necessarily public bodies. The list also includes undefined bodies. Half of the eight categories in the list - those proposed in sections 12(3)(b), 12(3)(d), 12(3)(f) and 12(3)(g) - refer to "entities". As this term has no legal definition, it may be difficult to decide what bodies fall into these categories. The list also includes bodies which are public but commercial. The proposed sections 12(3)(b),12(3)(c), 12(3)(d), 12(3)(e) and 12(3)(f) appear to cover a wide range of State-sponsored bodies with commercial activities. This means that under the Bill, a commercial State-sponsored body that suffers financial losses due to a defamatory publication could not recover more than nominal damages, while one of its competitors operating in the same market would not be subject to any such limit. The list also includes charter bodies, which may be corporate and public but not governmental. The proposed section 12(3)(b) includes in the list any body which is "an entity established by charter". This group seems to include bodies established by charter such as Trinity College, the Incorporated Law Society and the Royal College of Surgeons. It is not clear whether the Bill intends to impose a €1 limit on the damages that can be awarded in a defamation claim by any of these or similar bodies. Section 13 of the Bill, which refers to appeals in defamation cases, identifies the Supreme Court as the normal appellate court from the High Court. Since this Bill was published, significant changes have been made to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. I refer to the coming into effect on 28 October 2014 of the amendments provided for in the Thirty-third Amendment of the Constitution, and the establishment of the Court of Appeal on 28 October 2014 under that amendment. In addition, the wording of the proposed section 13(1)(b), unlike the proposed section 13(1)(a), does not seem to indicate what the appellate court may substitute for an award of nominal damages made by the High Court under the Bill. Furthermore, the Bill proposes the substantial approach of imposing a far-reaching limit to redress in any defamation action taken by a broad range of corporate bodies, in pursuit of an objective which appears quite disproportionate. The Bill's stated intention is to prevent public bodies from using the resources of the State to issue defamation proceedings to influence comment by the press and public. In practice, defamation proceedings by public bodies are very rare. It can hardly be argued that the press or the public in Ireland are reluctant to enter into robust criticism and debate regarding the actions and policies of public bodies. This Bill seems at best a legislative sledgehammer to crack a very small nut. The Defamation Act which is just five years old and was debated in some detail in both Houses in 2009 represents a recent and well thought-out balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to protection of good name and reputation. I have highlighted non-exhaustively some of the numerous questions that have arisen in our preliminary examination of the Defamation (Amendment) Bill 2014. More time is needed to consider the Bill in detail and further assess its potential wide-ranging implications. The Office of the Attorney General also needs to be consulted, as do the Departments and State agencies potentially involved. Section 5 of the 2009 Act already provides for a statutory review of the Act's operation, to be commenced within five years after the passing of the Act and to be completed within a year. Preparations for this statutory review have already begun within the Department of Justice and Equality. Subject to the reservations I have mentioned, the Minister considers that there may be a case in principle for reviewing the specific question of whether and to what extent a public body which is a corporate body should be entitled to bring a defamation action under section 12 of the 2009 Act and for assessing to what extent such an action remains relevant and appropriate. Such a review will need to take careful account of the many different types of public bodies which are corporate bodies. In particular, the issue being raised in this Bill is just one piece of a large and complex jigsaw. It would be unwise to treat it in isolation, particularly outside the context of the imminent statutory review of the 2009 Act. That review offers a valuable opportunity for consultation and discussion with stakeholders on this question and on the wider context of the Defamation Act overall, and should be fully used. The Government will not oppose the motion before the House today. In view of the reservations I have set out, however, further examination and substantial amendment of the Bill will be required and proposed by the Government on Committee Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can change my mind again.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim buíochas leis an Chathaoirleach agus leis an Seanadóir. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, wishes to thank the Senator for raising the matter and regrets that she is unable to be present for this discussion. As the Senator may be aware, members of the Judiciary are office holders, not employees; therefore, the provisions of the current statutory employment legislation do not apply to them. As such, they have no statutory entitlement to the categories of leave to which contractual employees are entitled such as maternity, adoptive and parental leave. Senators will be aware that, under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government. The current process for the appointment of judges is set out in sections 12 to 17, inclusive, of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995.The Constitution also provides for aspects of the terms and conditions of judges, such as remuneration, pension and age of retirement, to be regulated by law. Senators will be aware that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the pay and pensions of judges. In respect of maternity leave, while recognising that judges as officeholders have no statutory entitlement to maternity leave, judges due to give birth while in office have been permitted to avail of the same period of maternity leave available to civil servants and contractual employees under the legislation in effect at the time. The decision to allow judges to avail of maternity leave was taken with a view to ensuring their terms and conditions during their terms in office were not inferior to those of employees or to the terms and conditions to which they may have been entitled at an earlier stage of their careers. In addition, it was considered that not allowing judges to avail of maternity leave could serve to discourage women from applying to the Bench. The Minister has been informed that relatively few judges have availed of maternity leave in the past. She is pleased that the proportion of women in the Judiciary is increasing. Of the 81 judicial appointments made since the Government took office in March 2011, some 35 were female, or 43.2% of the total number of judges appointed. There are now 53 female judges, of a total of 161 judges, holding office in the State. This equates to 33% of all judges. As judges generally take up office at a later stage in their career, it is not anticipated that the number of judges availing of maternity leave will increase significantly. The Minister wishes to underline that it is intended that the established procedure of permitting judges to avail of paid maternity leave, in line with prevailing statutory entitlements, will continue. Senators will be aware that the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the presidents of the courts and the presiding judges. Under the Constitution, they are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. Issues which may arise in the management of the courts owing to the absence of a particular judge are matters for the president of the relevant court. As no procedures are in place to enable judges to avail of unpaid leave, the Minister is not in a position to comment on the unpaid aspects of the maternity and adoptive leave or unpaid parental leave. The Minister emphasises that every effort will be made to facilitate female members of the Judiciary in fulfilling their roles and that applications for unpaid leave will be considered on a case by case basis.  I again thank the Senator for raising this important issue. The Minister wishes to assure her that she will keep her updated on developments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I again thank the Senator. While this specific issue falls outside my area of responsibility, I do have responsibility for gender equality. Therefore, I have a keen issue in the issue raised by the Senator. I have explained that members of the Judiciary are not employees but are officeholders and as such do not fall within the statutory employment legislation. Having said that, the issue of paid maternity leave has been appropriately managed on a case by case basis by the Department in the small number of circumstances in which it has arisen. The independence of judges and their status as officeholders rather than employees is an important principle. The Minister considers it to be of paramount importance that women should not experience barriers to applying for and successfully taking up judicial appointments.Senators will appreciate the important role carried out by members of the Judiciary. It is important that judges be able to carry out their duties in ensuring access to justice. However, this need will also be balanced with the needs of the individual judge to avail of appropriate leave such as maternity or adoptive leave. While these matters have not caused any particular issue to date, the Minister wishes to assure the Senator that the Department will keep the matter under review.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Government on this important topic. I have made it clear before in this House that improving the system of direct provision to make it more humane is important to me personally and to the Government generally. Since I last spoke to the House on this subject on a Private Members' motion on 17 September 2014, there have been significant developments on two matters that I spoke about then - first, the High Court case challenging the direct provision system and, second, the operation of the independent group set up late last year to report to the Government on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. Dealing first with the legal challenge to the direct provision system in the case of C.A. and T.A. v. Minister for Justice and Equality, the High Court issued a judgment on 14 November 2014. This followed from a six-week hearing in the case ending last July. Though I cannot summarise here the 130-page judgment involved, I can say that, on the basis of the case as argued, the court could not find that the direct provision system breached fundamental human rights or was in breach of the Constitution because it is an administrative scheme without a legislative basis, or that the direct provision allowance, DPA, payment was ultra vires to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.The court found that certain aspects of the house rules, which deal with the day-to-day operation of the direct provision system, were unlawful or disproportionate to their objectives. These relate to the absence of an independent complaints procedure as well as the procedures involved in relation to absences from centres and room inspections. This court decision does not hinder the task of the independent working group; rather, it helps it. After all, that something is lawful does not necessarily mean it should continue as it is. Direct provision is a creature of Government and it is entirely apt that Government should now review it in detail with a view to making better the lives of those living in it. This objective is best served through the forensic, structured, co-operative approach of a working group than through the strictly legalistic process of a court case. Even in relation to those aspects of the house rules where the court did find fault, it is better that the corrections to be made are processed through the working group in order that the necessary expertise can be brought to bear on the matter. That expertise is obvious when one looks at the membership of the working group. It is chaired by former High Court judge, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various non-governmental organisations who have a long-standing interest in this area as well as a retired Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality and a former chairperson of the Local Authority Implementation Committee. The working group has not allowed the grass to grow under its feet. I commend to the House the web page on the Department of Justice and Equality's website dealing with this working group. This provides details of its terms of reference, membership, work programme and work progress. I highlight two aspects of its work which I think are particularly important. First, it has established three smaller, more focused working groups to deal with specific themes, namely, improvements to the living conditions in centres aimed at showing greater respect for the dignity of persons in the system and improving their quality of life; improved financial, educational, health supports for asylum applicants; and improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of asylum applications with particular regard to the length of the process. So far, in addition to the three plenary sessions, 14 meetings of these subgroups have been held and excellent engagement by all participants has been reported. Second, the working group is taking evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system, both in writing and orally. This evidence is not intermediated by Departments, by centre management or by NGOs. The working group advertised in each centre for written submissions from residents and I understand these have been very informative. The group is also engaged in an ongoing direct consultative process whereby its members visit centres throughout the country and speak directly to residents. This process will end in early February and will feed into the group's deliberations. A number of consultation sessions with particular groups of applicants, including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking or sexual violence, and members of the LGBTI community will also be undertaken during that period. There will be an opportunity for some protection applicants to make oral submissions to a full meeting of the working group. The working group also agreed to invite a number of experts to make oral submissions to a future meeting. The end result of all of this will be that the entire working group will have an excellent understanding of the direct provision system. It can then confidently fulfil its mandate to report to Government and indicate what actions could be taken in the short and longer term which are directed towards improving existing arrangements in the processing of protection applications and showing greater respect for the dignity of persons in the system and improving their quality of life by enhancing the support and services currently available. The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not interfere with existing border controls and immigration policies. The agreed terms of reference do not indicate any timeframe for the working group's deliberations but the Government would welcome a report by Easter. I am sure Members of this House would like a fair wind to be given to the working group and I will arrange for a transcript of these statements today to be given to its chairman. I would also add that I am delighted that this House is again debating the issue of direct provision. It shows that the Houses of the Oireachtas work best when we take an issue such as direct provision, work across parties to try to find solutions and raise its profile in order that it remains at the top of the political agenda.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senators for their contributions. At a time when cynicism about politics is at is height it is a great credit to this House that this issue has been raised here consistently. There is a level of understanding and agreement across the House on the importance of this issue. I feel keenly that as public representatives we have a responsibility to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, have no political power, cannot access mainstream media and are often, as in this case, on the edge of society. If such people do not have advocates in this House then they will not get them anywhere else. It is vital that both Houses of the Oireachtas debate the matter. It is a credit to this House that the issue of direct provision has been raised repeatedly. I am quite happy to return here and give updates on where we are. One expects statements from the Government or a Department to have a mix of legalistic language and deal with the issues of High Court cases and legislation. Every Senator here who has contributed to this debate will agree with me that we must get back to the human stories behind direct provision. I have visited direct provision centres up and down this land over the past number of months and since I was given the opportunity to serve as a junior Minister. I have visited centres in Waterford, Limerick, Sligo, Laois, the Balseskin Reception Centre in Dublin and Galway. Hand on heart, as an asylum seeker, I could see myself spending a period of weeks or months in some centres but there were some in which I would not like to spend a night. I met a man in a direct provision centre in Limerick who is quite literally broken. It is very difficult not to be affected by meeting someone like that. He is completely broken. He had come from difficult and vulnerable circumstances when he arrived here. As a society, system and country we have compounded his misery and broken him and I do not know if he will ever be repaired. I feel keenly that we have a responsibility to him, and also to children, who have been broken by the situation in which they find themselves. On my visits I noticed children playing a game called kitchen in the play spaces provided in direct provision centres. When they were playing they looked for an orange dispenser in the toy because that is the only way they know to get orange juice. It has never been given to them by their mother and they do not know about food preparation. Therefore, it is very disconcerting for me to see that this country still persists in prolonging its love affair with incarceration. Apparently in the 1950s we had 250,000 people in mental institutions. Ireland also has a history of mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and an industrial schools system, yet again we revert to incarcerating and storing people while they wait for their asylum applications to be processed.  The current system was first brought in as a reaction to about 10,000 people a year coming into the country and wanting to ensure nobody was ever made homeless, as Senator Bacik has said. The system has proven successful because no asylum seeker who has gone through this process has ever been made homeless. The number of asylum seekers today is much reduced. I reject the idea of a pull factor and collectively we have to reject the idea of a pull factor. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a belief that whatever improvements we make, whether we make the system more humane, treat people with dignity, aspire to have a system that we can be proud of, somehow flares will be set off and people will come here who would not have done otherwise. There is more movement of people across Europe now than since the end of the Second World War so naturally statistics will reflect the change. There has been an increase in the number of asylum applications in Ireland but that number has been collapsing for the past ten to 12 years. The number has decreased, from a figure of around 10,000 down to around 800 over the past number of years. If there has been an increase then it is a reflection of what is happening across the European Union. I am loth to discuss many of the issues raised here because I want to give the working group the independence to deal with them collectively and make recommendations to Government. We will deal with them as a collective set of recommendations. I think the group can be radical and find solutions. When the working group finalises its deliberations and makes recommendations we will find a way to implement workable and sustainable solutions that will make the current system work an awful lot better.As regards the Government's commitment to this issue, the statement of priorities of both Government parties was signed off on last summer and it included reform of the direct provision system. A commitment was made that a protection Bill would be brought before the Oireachtas and that will happen this month. In addition, a working group has been established. I wanted to see the full report done by Easter. There is an expectation that there may be an interim report as well. In fairness, however, rather than asking the working group to spend time on an interim report, it is reasonable to wait a number of months for the full report. I feel keenly about our responsibilities as a society. I spend half my time in the Department of Justice and Equality and the other half in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I also spend a lot of time on commemorations, which affects my mindset on this. When we talk about the 1916 Rising, the Proclamation and the centenary in 2016, in addition to rights, responsibilities and opportunities for all our citizens, that was aspirational 100 years ago. We also talk about the precious nature of childhood, treating people with dignity and true republican values. When we see the names of the seven people who signed the Proclamation, two of them were not born in Ireland. Another two of them were sons of migrants to this country. Through this working group and the generosity of the political system, we have an opportunity to break down much of the cynicism that people have about Irish politics. Members of this House consistently raise an issue that they know is wrong, but I am not sure if their clinics are full of people who are necessarily raising the matter or if their e-mail accounts are full of people raising it either. However, they are raising it on a cross-party basis because they want to see changes. That is when our political system works best. I want to come back and engage with this House as often as I possibly can. I appreciate the opportunity to do so. I commend Senators' commitment to this issue. When the legislation comes through, it should be thoroughly scrutinised. When the working group's report is debated in the House, let us work collectively to ensure it can be implemented. When the five years of this Oireachtas are over, we will be able to say that is one good, solid piece of work that we achieved collectively.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is unable to be here this evening due to another commitment. I am pleased, therefore, to have this opportunity to address on her behalf the important subject of mediation. I thank the Senators for providing me with the opportunity to address this important issue. As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government for National Recovery 2011 - 2016 contains the following commitment: "We will encourage and facilitate use of mediation to resolve commercial, civil and family disputes in order to speed up resolution of disputes, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings." The general position is that the Minister for Justice and Equality obtained Government approval for publication of the general scheme of the proposed mediation Bill in March 2012. The contents of the general scheme of the Bill were subsequently considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. That committee's subsequent report identified a number of specific issues meriting further examination in the context of the drafting of the Bill. The current position is that the Bill is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC. Senators will appreciate that the Government has a demanding schedule of urgent Bills which are currently being drafted in the OPC. For that reason, it is not possible to give a specific date for publication of the Bill at this stage. However, the Minister has asked me to say that she intends to proceed quickly with enactment of the legislation following publication later this year. During this short intervention, I want to focus on certain key provisions of the Bill. The Department has met Ms Josepha Madigan on the Bill. The Bill, when published, will take account of her valuable insights. One of the main aspects of the Bill is the introduction of a key provision which provides for the introduction of an obligation on solicitors to advise their clients to consider utilising mediation as an alternative to court proceedings for the resolution of disputes. Under the section, it is proposed that a solicitor must advise his or her client to consider using mediation as an alternative means of resolving the dispute; provide the client with information concerning mediation services, including the names and addresses of persons or organisations qualified to provide such services; and provide an estimate of the legal costs likely to arise in the event of court proceedings, together with an estimate of legal costs if the client is unsuccessful in those proceedings. This provision further requires that any person commencing civil proceedings must provide the court with a written statement confirming that his or her solicitor advised on the possible use of mediation as an alternative to the court proceedings for settling the dispute. I should add that the Bill places a similar obligation on a barrister with regard to the provision of information on mediation. The Bill further provides that mediation may be embarked upon by parties on their own initiative at any stage prior to, or after the commencement of, court proceedings. The section also contains a provision which is designed to reinforce the fundamental principle that the outcome of a mediation process shall be determined by the parties themselves. It also underlines the principle that participation in mediation is voluntary, and any party involved in a mediation process may withdraw from it at any time and without explanation. The Bill also contains important provisions concerning the role of the mediator. It requires a mediator to prepare a written agreement on the terms of the mediation process; places an obligation on the mediator to establish whether he or she has, or may have, any existing or potential conflicts of interest in the case; and sets out the information which must be given by the mediator to the parties before the commencement of the process, and which includes information concerning the voluntary nature of the process, the manner in which the mediation process can be concluded and confirmation that the outcome of the process will be determined by the parties themselves. The Minister believes that parties to mediation should be informed as far as possible in making decisions regarding a choice of mediator. For that reason, the Bill contains a requirement that a mediator must, before the commencement of the mediation process, provide details to all parties of his or her training and experience in mediation. This is in line with the practice already set out in various voluntary codes of practice for mediators. A mediator must also, if requested, provide a party with information regarding any specialist training he or she might have which would be relevant to the matter at hand as well as details of any continuing professional development activities which he or she has undertaken. Confidentiality is a basic and fundamental aspect of any mediation process. Therefore, the Bill will provide that confidentiality should generally apply to communications made during mediation processes. However, in certain circumstances, the interests of justice would not be served by confidentiality and the Bill therefore provides that it will not apply where disclosure of a mediation communication is necessary to implement any agreement arising from the mediation; where disclosure is necessary to prevent physical or psychological injury to a party; where disclosure is required by law; where a mediation communication is used to commit or conceal a crime, or to threaten a party to the mediation process; and where the communication is needed to prove or disprove a civil claim relating to alleged negligence or misconduct of a mediator during the mediation. The Bill also provides that the parties alone have the power to determine whether an agreement has been reached and the manner in which it becomes enforceable. The section further provides that a court may, on the application of the parties to any written agreement reached at mediation, enforce the agreement.In addition, the Bill provides that a court may, either on the application of any party involved in proceedings or of its own motion, where it considers it appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case, invite the parties to consider using mediation as an alternative to the proceedings. The Bill also provides that where a court has invited parties to consider using mediation, it may, in awarding costs in the proceedings, have regard to any unreasonable refusal by a party to consider using mediation where such a process had, in the court's opinion, a reasonable prospect of success. Following publication of the general scheme, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held two days of oral hearings and, subsequently, in June 2012, published a report on the general scheme of the Bill. While the committee's report did not make recommendations, it presented some observations on particular issues which arose both from the submissions received by the committee and during the oral hearings. A key issue identified by the committee was the possible establishment of a regulatory structure for the mediation sector. The Minister has asked me to inform the House that, following receipt of the report of the joint committee, her Department held consultations with several mediation bodies and individual mediators on the issues identified in the report, in particular the possible establishment of a regulatory structure. The position regarding the establishment of such a regulatory structure is that the Minister is conscious that many qualified mediators are drawn from professions which are already subject to strict regulatory oversight. They include members of the legal profession and professionals from fields as diverse as accountancy, engineering and social work. Any new regulatory structures for mediators must take due account, therefore, of the existence of these regulatory regimes and ensure that any further regulatory burdens and compliance costs are both necessary and proportionate. One possible way forward would be to give statutory recognition to a representative body or council established by the mediation sector itself. Such a body could be entrusted with functions such as promoting public awareness of and providing information to the public about the availability and operation of mediation services across the State; maintaining and developing standards for the provision of mediation services; drawing up and overseeing the operation and application of codes of practice for mediators; establishing and maintaining a register of mediators who have signed up to approved codes of practice; developing and approving continuing professional development activities for mediators; and advising on the establishment and operation of mediation information sessions in family law cases. The discussions which have taken place with mediation bodies have focused on the establishment of such a structure. The intention is that it would be self-financing and would consist of representatives drawn from across the mediation sector. The Minister has asked me to refer to another important provision which will be included in the forthcoming Bill. The Government believes that mediation has a particularly important role to play as an alternative to adversarial family law proceedings. Mediation can provide a less stressful and adversarial process for the resolution of cases of family breakdown and the related issues of custody and access to children. The Bill will contain a provision, therefore, which will require parties embarking on such proceedings to attend mediation information sessions. Such a requirement is in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on mediation and conciliation. Discussions have taken place with the Legal Aid Board on this issue and the board has indicated that it would be willing to assist in the provision of mandatory information sessions in family law cases involving children. I should also point out that there is an increasing international trend towards the use of mediation as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes. For example, a mediation directive has been adopted at European Union level and has been given effect throughout the EU since 2011. The directive has been given effect here in the European Communities (Mediation) Regulations 2011. I thank Senators for tabling this motion and for providing the House with an opportunity to discuss this important subject. I appreciate that Senators are anxious for this Bill be brought before the Seanad first and I will communicate their desire directly to the Minister herself.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None« I am taking Second Stage on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who cannot be present. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 is one of a series of measures taken by the Government, as part of a comprehensive programme of justice reform, which will substantially strengthen Garda accountability. This reform programme is being informed to a substantial extent by the excellent work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. Overall, the Government’s objectives are to ensure the confidence of the public in An Garda Síochána is maintained, as well as to bring forward the necessary change to ensure the high-quality and respected service An Garda Síochána has provided is continued and enhanced to better meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing. The underlying focus of the reform programme, supervised by the Cabinet committee on justice reform and chaired by the Taoiseach, is to put in place effective arrangements for the oversight, governance and accountability of An Garda Síochána. As a member of the Cabinet committee, and more particularly as the responsible line Minister, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is leading the implementation of the reform programme. The Bill marks an important element of these reforms. Before turning to deal specifically with the Bill, I wish to update Senators briefly on the other important elements of the justice reform programme. The Minister has published the scheme of a Bill for the proposed new policing authority which takes into account a significant number of the recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The Bill is being drafted on a priority basis and the scheme was considered by the joint committee in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny. The Minister is looking forward to publishing the Bill and bringing it before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. That will afford us another opportunity to consider any additional measure that might be required to enhance the role of GSOC, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.· The independent review mechanism, consisting of a panel of counsel established to examine approximately 300 complaints alleging Garda misconduct or problems with investigating misconduct, is continuing its work and has made significant progress. The Public Appointments Service has managed the first open competition to appoint a new Garda Commissioner which gave rise to the appointment of the current commissioner. Following a process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service seeking expressions of interest, the Government has nominated Ms Josephine Feehily as the chairperson-designate for the forthcoming independent policing authority. As chairperson-designate, Ms Feehily will assist in the preparations for the establishment of the authority. The Minister has also published the Garda Inspectorate’s crime inspectorate report which deals with crime recording and investigation. It also deals with some of the concerns raised by Mr. Seán Guerin, SC, in his report to the Government earlier this year about certain Garda actions. The report contains more than 200 recommendations for implementation which are being actively pursued. The establishment of a commission of investigation into matters identified in the Guerin report is in train. The Fennelly commission of investigation is proceeding with its task of examining the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda stations for many years, as well as other matters. It has indicated that it will submit an interim report on specific issues. The report on Judge Cooke’s inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC has been published. GSOC has published a redacted version of the report it commissioned into the possible disclosure of confidential information. Following the recent publication of the report of the Garda professional standards unit on cancellations in the fixed charge processing system, a further set of new arrangements has been introduced, including the referral for determination by the Director of Public Prosecution of cases involving gardaí in seeking to have points cancelled on the basis that they were performing official duties at the time; an exemption provided in law for gardaí and other emergency vehicle drivers; the establishment of a new enforcement unit in the fixed-charge processing office which will follow up on all cases cancelled owing to the fixed charge notice being returned having not been delivered through the postal system; and consultations between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the introduction of legislative changes arising from recommendations made in the report. In addition, the Minister has appointed Judge Mathew Deery, former President of the Circuit Court, as the independent oversight authority for the fixed charge processing system. The authority will be free to inspect at random any fixed charge notice cancellation and report its findings on the operation of the system to the Minister. The review of An Garda Síochána under the Haddington Road agreement is expected to be completed shortly. It encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda Síochána. The Minister has published the report of the independent review group on the Department of Justice and Equality and is working closely with the Department’s senior management team to implement the report’s recommendations. The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 has amended Garda legislation to allow Garda members to make protected disclosures to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct. The relevant provisions of the Act have been brought into operation. In presenting the Bill to the House I look forward to constructive engagement with Senators. Overall, the Minister believes it is important that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should not forget the ongoing and substantial contribution An Garda Síochána and its members have made for over 90 years in keeping communities safe and preserving the security of the State. This has been a contribution delivered in the face of ever present threats and tragically at the cost of the lives of some members of the force. It is a contribution for which we should be grateful to the men and women of An Garda Síochána. However, for all this good work, the Minister is not blind to that which is not good, including issues related to penalty points, crime investigation and responding to whistleblowers. In some cases, what we have learned about the behaviour of members of An Garda Síochána has struck at the heart of our shared understanding of what justice itself is. We live in a republic - a republic of laws - in which there is not and never can be one law for some but not others, in which all persons are and should always be treated equally. That is what we expect and, more importantly, what we are entitled to expect. We have had too much controversy of late regarding An Garda Síochána. The Minister acknowledges that this has been a difficult time for the members of An Garda Síochána, the vast majority of whom joined the force with the sincerest of aspirations to provide the highest levels of service for the public and are disappointed at the failures that have been uncovered and the controversies that have raged. Similarly, the Minister is aware that there is a commonly shared determination and desire within An Garda Síochána and among communities across the country to see reform happen, to see a break from the past and to move on from this period of controversy to a new one of confidence. She wants to see confidence trumping controversy. She wants to see confidence restored in the work of An Garda Síochána. She wants to see the organisation, structures, practices and systems put in place to support the men and women of An Garda Síochána to deliver effectively the best possible policing and security services for communities and the country. She wants to see, as she said when taking office, a sea change in the performance, administration and oversight of justice and policing in the State. This will involve confronting deficiencies and failures. It will also involve examining, openly, transparently and vigorously, operational practices that are simply not up to standard. This is being done and at the heart of the Government's programme of justice reform. Ultimately, the Minister wants to move from the concept of a police force to delivery of a police service that is fit and ready to meet the realities, requirements and expectations of 21st century policing. Achieving this requires acknowledgment, reforms and resources. The Government has begun the process of addressing the question of resources. It has provided funding for 400 new Garda vehicles. Some 300 trainees have recently entered the Garda College in Templemore - the first new intake since 2009 - and arrangements are under way to civilianise immigration functions which will free up 150 gardaí for front-line policing duties. In presenting the justice reform programme the Minister has also stressed her priority objective of strengthening the role and remit of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. The Bill seeks to deliver on this commitment. As Senators will be aware, the primary functions of GSOC are concerned with dealing with complaints against Garda members and examining Garda practices and procedures. However, since its establishment under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, there have been certain restrictions on the extent to which the GSOC functions can be exercised. The preparation of the Bill has been informed by a public consultation process which was completed in May 2014, the Farmleigh consultation seminar in June 2014 which was attended by 100 participants representing key stakeholders and direct contacts with GSOC. It has also been informed by the valuable work carried out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. As Senators will be aware, the joint committee's report contained extensive recommendations following its comprehensive review of current Garda legislation. This followed a series of hearings and visits to other jurisdictions. The Minister is grateful to the committee for the report and I am happy that the Bill addresses some of its recommendations. Very careful further consideration is being given to the report with reference to the preparation of the legislation on the proposed policing authority. For the most part, the Bill amends the Garda Síochána Act 2005 which is the primary statute governing An Garda Síochána. Some of the amendments involved are technical in nature and I will deal with them more specifically as the Bill progresses. Amendments are also being made to the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to permit GSOC to exercise certain additional police powers. I now turn to the specific content of the Bill. Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, are standard provisions containing definitions and technical amendments arising from later provisions in the Bill. Section 4 extends the general time limit in section 84(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 for making a complaint to GSOC from six to 12 months. This does not alter the current position under which it is open to GSOC to extend the time limit if it considers there are good reasons for doing so. Senators will be aware that the issue of time limits was covered in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee. Section 5 is to be read in conjunction with sections 12 and 13. It substitutes a new definition of ‘‘enactment’’ in section 98(5) of the 2005 Act, as amended, to remove the current prohibitions on GSOC exercising police powers under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009. In that context, section 12 amends the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 to enable GSOC to undertake the interception of communications for the purposes of a criminal investigation by it under the Garda Síochána Act 2005. The approach adopted is that a GSOC investigating officer will have the powers that would be available to An Garda Síochána in the same circumstances. In addition, the conditions and safeguards contained in the 1993 Act will operate where interception is sought by GSOC. Similarly, section 13 provides for amendments to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to enable GSOC to carry out surveillance where it is necessary in connection with a criminal investigation into an arrestable offence. In this context, GSOC will be in the same position as An Garda Síochána for the purposes of conducting such an investigation. Section 6 amends section 102 of the 2005 Act to broaden the scope for the Minister to refer a matter to GSOC to allow it to investigate it, even if the identity of the member of An Garda Síochána is not known at the time of the investigation or where the investigation may also involve a person who is not a member of An Garda Síochána. These issues were identified in Judge Cooke's report as ones that could usefully be clarified and the Minister has undertaken that this be done. Section 7 inserts a new section 102B into the 2005 Act to bring the Garda Commissioner within the scope of GSOC investigations for the first time.This was also an issue addressed in the report of the joint committee. This section was the subject of debate during the passage of the Bill in the Dáil, in particular, the question of whether the consent of the Minister should be required where GSOC proposed to undertake an investigation on its own initiative into alleged misconduct on the part of the Garda Commissioner. After careful consideration and reflecting on that debate, as well as taking account of the key position of the Garda Commissioner in security matters, the provisions of section 102B were strengthened on Report Stage to provide a specific role for the Government, rather than just the Minister, in the important decisions to be taken under the section.  In addition to carrying out general policing functions, the Garda Commissioner is head of the national security service in which role he or she fulfils a vital role closely linked with the obligations of the Government to preserve the security of the State. In these circumstances the Minister believes it is appropriate the Government should approve the granting or withholding of consent by the Minister where the conduct of the Garda Commissioner is called into question. Moreover, the original proposal has been further strengthened to ensure that in a situation where a request from GSOC to undertake an investigation into conduct of the Garda Commissioner is being refused, this can only be done for stated reasons. The practical reality is that only in exceptional cases consent to a proposed investigation would not be given and in these circumstances specific reasons will be provided. The Minister believes that, on foot of a demonstrable concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct, it is extremely unlikely in almost any circumstance that consent would be withheld. Accordingly, subsection (1) of the new section enables GSOC to investigate, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so and subject to the consent of the Minister given with the approval of the Government, any matter that gives rise to a concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct. Subsection (2) allows the Minister, with the approval of the Government, if he or she considers it desirable in the public interest to do so, to request GSOC to investigate any matter that gives rise to a concern that the Garda Commissioner may have done anything referred to in subsection (1) and the commission is required to investigate that matter. By virtue of subsection (3), the Minister may, with the approval of the Government, for stated reasons, refuse to consent to an investigation by GSOC of any matter under subsection (2). Subsections (4) and (5) are provisions necessary to facilitate the operation of the section. In particular, adaptations are being made to the 2005 Act to ensure GSOC will have the necessary powers to undertake an investigation involving the Garda Commissioner. Section 8 is consequential on the insertion of the new section 102B under section 7. It amends section 103 of the 2005 Act which deals with keeping certain persons informed of GSOC investigations. Section 9 inserts a new section 103A into the 2005 Act and is intended to strengthen the flow of information from An Garda Síochána to GSOC, in particular under the protocol arrangements in place under section 108. Specifically, it imposes a statutory duty on the Garda Commissioner to ensure information to be provided by An Garda Síochána for GSOC for the purposes of an investigation will be supplied as soon as practicable. Section 10 replaces section 106 of the 2005 Act and allows GSOC for the first time to carry out an examination, on its own initiative, of practices, policies or procedures of An Garda Síochána for the purpose of preventing or reducing complaints. Currently, it can only do this when requested by the Minister and the change being proposed was recommended by the joint committee. The reports will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to the possible exclusion of certain matters such as those, for example, relating to national security or where the commission of an offence may be facilitated. Just as GSOC is being given the power to initiate examinations of Garda practices independently, the Minister believes, in line with a further recommendation of the joint committee, that it should also be open to the Garda Inspectorate to do this. Accordingly, section 11 amends section 117(2) of the 2005 Act to enable the inspectorate to conduct, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, inspections or inquiries into a particular aspect of the operation and administration of An Garda Síochána. At present, the inspectorate can only conduct such an inspection or inquiry with the prior consent of the Minister. Section 14 sets out the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions for the Bill. The Minister is conscious that the changes proposed in the Bill will give rise to additional demands on the resources of GSOC and also the Garda Inspectorate. I referred briefly to budget 2015 in respect of An Garda Síochána. I can also confirm to the House that budget 2015 provided for an increase of €1 million in the allocation to GSOC and an increase of €250,000 in the allocation to the inspectorate. Throughout the recent public debate on justice reform the Minister has consistently made it clear that the reform must not simply be about change for its own sake. Our reforms are about providing the country with the police force it needs, operating to the highest professional standards, ready to meet existing and emerging challenges. They are about ensuring that throughout the country the men and women of An Garda Síochána will be fully supported by good organisational structures, practices and systems to ensure they can deliver the best possible policing and security services for communities and their people. They are about addressing broader systematic failures which have called into question the capacity of the Garda organisation to function properly and carry out its core tasks. The reforms are about restoring the confidence of the public in An Garda Síochána. I commend the Bill to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate. I am pleased that the Bill has attracted a significant degree of consensus, particularly in regard to its key provisions which provide for an expansion of the remit and powers of both GSOC and An Garda Síochána's Inspectorate. I am grateful to Senators for their support in regards to these aspects. I hope, given the level of consensus that has been demonstrated, that it will be possible to enact this Bill as quickly as possible. As I said in my opening contribution, the Bill is one of a series of measures that have been taken by the Government as part of a comprehensive programme of justice reform which will substantially strengthen Garda accountability. This reform programme is being informed, to a substantial extent, by the excellent work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. However, I stress again that the Bill is not and was never intended to be the only or primary legislative response from the Government to the relevant work of the Oireachtas joint committee. I again draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister published the scheme of a Bill for the proposed new policing authority before Christmas. The scheme takes into account a significant number of the recommendations made by an Oireachtas joint committee. The scheme is being considered by the joint committee in the course of pre-legislative scrutiny and the Bill is being drafted on a priority basis.  The Minister intends to bring the Bill before the Oireachtas as soon as is practicable. The establishment of a new policing authority will be a significant element of the Government's programme of reform to tackle head-on the systematic failures which have come to light in An Garda Síochána. The Bill contributes to these reforms by proactively enhancing the capacity of GSOC and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate. Once again I express my gratitude to Senators who have expressed their support for the Bill and look forward to its early enactment.  I shall respond directly to Senator Feargal Quinn's significant contribution on the area of crime prevention. About 18 months ago I read an article by Neil Gaiman, which was published in The Guardian newspaper. He wrote about attending a conference of prison operators in the United States. He mentioned that when they made plans for the potential prison population 15 years hence, they looked at the literacy levels of ten and 11 year olds in any given district. Therefore, I suggest we have a conversation another time on different and more expansive ways to tackle crime.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to come before the House today to represent the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and present the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for health services to be made available without charge to women who were resident in Magdalen laundries and similar institutions. The Bill also provides that the women concerned will not be required to pay the statutory charge for public acute hospital inpatient services and that the ex gratia payments being made, including top-up pension payments, will not be included in the financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. As Senators will be aware, the Bill is just one part of a wider package of supports for the women concerned. Before I go into detail about the Bill, I will outline the background to the legislation and other supports the Government is providing for the women concerned. In June 2011 it decided to set up an inquiry to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen laundries. Former Senator Martin McAleese chaired the inquiry. His report of over 1,000 pages was published in February 2013. It is a very detailed, clear and objective exposition of the facts in regard to the ten Magdalen laundries. It found that just over 10,000 women had spent time in a Magdalen laundry since the founding of the State. The manner in which the women concerned found themselves in Magdalen laundries varied greatly. There were a large number of referrals by the women themselves. There were also many referrals to Magdalen laundries made by families, priests or clergy, as well as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Red Cross and Samaritans. In addition, 27% of referrals were made by or facilitated by the State. The McAleese report makes the point that in today's world it is difficult to understand the circumstances which could in the past have led to daughters, sisters and mothers being placed in the laundries. It may be equally difficult to understand the apparent acceptance by families of instructions from people in positions of authority, particularly priests, in family matters. The report further states it would be unfair to judge these cases or the people concerned by applying today's standards and societal norms. It points out that, because of the general life expectancy in society at the time, it was common for one or more parents of the girls or women to be deceased. The point needs to be made that many of these girls or women ended up in these institutions simply because they did not have any person in a position to look after them. The Magdalen laundries were, in many cases, used as a temporary measure in the absence of more appropriate services which simply were not available at the time. They were described in the McAleese report as “often the only door open to these women". Many of the women and girls worked in the laundries for long periods. About half of the women were in the laundries for periods in excess of three years. The referrals made by State agencies came about in a variety of ways. There were referrals from industrial and reform schools, as well as health and social services, the then existing county homes and psychiatric hospitals. There were also referrals from the criminal justice system, including persons on remand; referrals as a condition of probation; other less formalised referrals facilitated by the courts; referrals from prison; and referrals made by An Garda Síochána. Owing to the lack of more appropriate services, many of the case studies demonstrate widespread acceptance of practices that would be unacceptable to us today. The case studies often illustrate the fact that alternative social care arrangements for the women concerned were often simply not available at the time. The report also makes the point that there seems to be a mistaken public perception that women referred to these institutions were predominately lone parents. This perception does not reflect the reality in most cases. The report found that placements of girls or women in Magdalen laundries were made for a wide range of reasons. It is hard to credit nowadays that some referrals were seen as a means of providing for girls or women with physical disabilities, or with a mental or psychiatric illness. Some had intellectual disabilities and special needs, while others were referred because of advanced age. In other cases girls or women were placed in Magdalen laundries by their families following family disputes or as a result of abuse or neglect in the home. Only in a minority of cases did they relate to girls or women rejected by their families for having a child. The case studies which are included in the report provide very sad and harrowing accounts of a traumatic time in the lives of the girls and women concerned. This is especially the case when we consider the fact that, at that most vulnerable time in their lives, they did not just experience a very traumatic removal from their homes and communities. In many cases, this was also followed by a prolonged and extreme level of social exclusion and ostracisation by society. On the basis of the McAleese report and, in particular, based on the wishes of the women themselves, the Government decided that a non-adversarial scheme for women who had worked in Magdalen laundries or similar institutions should be introduced. Mr. Justice Quirke was then asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate scheme. He reported in May 2013 and all of his recommendations were accepted in principle by the Government in June that year. The Department of Justice and Equality then started work immediately on setting up a scheme which was publicised widely both in this country and abroad. The primary support being provided by the Government is the scheme of ex gratia payments to women who were in these institutions. Under the scheme, applicants do not have to prove that they suffered any abuse or damages. The manner of their referral to the institution is also not considered relevant. All that has to be established is that a woman was admitted to and worked in a relevant institution. For this reason, it should be recognised that the scheme represents a very appropriate and caring provision by the Government and the State for the women concerned in respect of what was inevitably a very traumatic experience in their lives. Under the scheme’s provisions, they are eligible for a payment of between €11,500 and €100,000, depending on the length of stay. As recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke, the balance of lump sums in excess of €50,000 is being paid in weekly instalments to provide an income spread over a longer period. To date, decisions have been made on almost 90% of applications out of 776 received so far.A total of €18 million has so far been paid out to the women. The remaining applications are at various stages of the process - some have been received only recently, some require further information, investigation or verifications. Work is progressing on these cases as quickly as possible. For the purpose of clarity, applications for the scheme remain open and I anticipate that a small number of further applications will be received. The processing of all applications starts off on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records. Where the records of institutions are incomplete, as they are in a small number of cases, the Department arranges to meet the applicants affected and the Department is generally able to verify the information provided by the applicant by corroborating the information with the institutions or third parties. The Quirke report also recommended that the ex gratia payments should also include top-up pension payments of up to €100 for those under the age of 66 years and up to €230.30 for those aged 66 or over. These payments are being made by the Department of Social Protection and I would like to thank the Minister for Social Protection for her assistance in that regard. Mr. Justice Quirke recommended that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation with regard to the provision of health services. In his report, Mr. Justice Quirke was of the opinion that Magdalen women should be provided with access to a comprehensive suite of health services. Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation that the women receive medical services equivalent to those provided to the holder of a HAA card is being given effect in this Bill. However he also stated "not all of the services described in the [Hepatitis C] Guide may be directly relevant to the Magdalen women and any comparable Guide for the Magdalen women would require suitable adaptation" It should be noted that the services provided in section 2 of the Bill are precisely those recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke on Page 35 of his report. These are: GP services; prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances; dental services; ophthalmic services; aural services; home support; home nursing; counselling services; and a range of other services, to include chiropody-podiatry and physiotherapy. All of these services are specified in section 2 of the Bill and will be made available free of charge to the women who were in Magdalen laundries. There has been some incorrect comment in regard to the Bill which has suggested the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 also provides for alternative therapies such as massage, aromatherapy, reflexology or acupuncture; counselling services for immediate family members of persons with hepatitis C; provisions that the persons not have to wait more than two weeks for an appointment with a specialist, liaison officers; and personal advocacy services. There are no such provisions in the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. However, some additional services are available to persons with hepatitis C under the HAA card scheme on an administrative basis that are in addition to those provided for in the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. These include drug treatments for hepatitis that are not on the approved medicines list; counselling for immediate family members in regard to the effects of hepatitis C, and the need to avoid infection of other family members; and open access to specialist hospital treatment for hepatitis C. These provisions are not contained in the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 and it would make no sense whatsoever to include these specific provisions in this Bill. The Magdalen women do not have this illness and would not need or benefit in any way from the specific treatments for hepatitis C. With regard to the question of alternative therapies, the Minister for Health has reservations about such therapies being provided and funded through the health service and, for that reason, they were not included in the Bill, just as they are not included in the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, or in Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations. However, the Minister for Justice and Equality is considering options for provision of such services on an administrative basis outside of legislation. I thank the Minister for Health for his assistance in the provision of this very comprehensive suite of medical services, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. Senators will note that the range of health services being made available, without charge, are also those services listed in section 2 of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, which provides for persons affected by hepatitis C. This very comprehensive list of services includes all of the health services identified by Mr. Justice Quirke. The Bill also provides these women with exemption from charges for acute inpatient services. It also provides that payments made to these women arising from the scheme of ex gratia payments will not be included in any financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. The focus is firmly on the health needs of the women and some of the services provided will be accessible through referral by a doctor or nurse.Referral will ensure that the health care provided will be co-ordinated and the most appropriate to each participant. There is no means test to access these services and they will be provided without charge to relevant participants in the ex gratia scheme. All health systems around the world vary in arrangements and each system is practically unique. Therefore, the Minister for Health has agreed, given the wide variation in the organisation of different countries' health systems, that access to equivalent health services for participants living abroad is best dealt with on an administrative basis by the HSE. The HSE will deal with a woman residing overseas as appropriate to the specific circumstances of the individual, the country of residence and its health system. Those women living abroad will be supported in sourcing and paying for services and securing refunds to the extent that they would be entitled to if resident in the State. There will be circumstances where a service similar to or aligned with what they would receive in the State may not be available and the HSE will have a variety of arrangements with such participants. A specific contact will be established in the HSE with whom the overseas participants can liaise in terms of arranging access to services and recouping the costs. This dedicated point of contact will provide clarity on what exactly the participant is entitled to in line with what is available in her country of residence. The HSE will also provide an information booklet to the women here and abroad setting out in detail the services to which they are entitled. I understand there has been some comment about the lack of explicit reference in the Bill to a so-called enhanced card. It is important to clarify that neither the standard medical card nor any new card is explicitly set out in the Health Act 1970 or the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill 2014. This is normal legislative practice. It will be a matter for the HSE to decide on the practical arrangements, such as a type of card, to be put in place in order to ensure that the women can easily demonstrate their eligibility for services under this legislation. One operational possibility is that an RWRCI card, based on the name of the legislation, may be issued to the qualifying women. There has also been some comment suggesting no provision is being made for women entitled to these supports who do not have capacity to make the necessary applications or arrangements but this is incorrect. The women are already covered by section 21 - appointment of a care representative - under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Separate legislation which the Minister has already brought before the Dáil will cater for cases where the applicant is found to lack capacity but has not been made a ward of court or where there is no enduring power of attorney. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill provides for the appointment of a person by a court to act on behalf of the applicant in regard to his or her financial affairs and this will include applications for ex gratia payments under the scheme. This Bill is already awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil and I expect it to be enacted in the first half of this year. That Bill also provides for decision making assistants, co-decision makers, decision-making representatives and the public guardian, measures which are well suited to look after the best interests of the Magdalen women who have capacity issues. It would not make sense to introduce a special scheme for the women who lack capacity in the light of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill which has already passed Second Stage in the Dáil.  The Department of Justice and Equality is careful to ensure applicants have the necessary capacity and cross-check with other Departments to establish whether there are issues. A medical assessment is sought if there is any indication that an applicant under the scheme has capacity issues. Some 40 women in this category have been identified to date and payments to these women are being made once proper safeguards are in place. As we need to have regard to the mental capacity of a number of these women, section 2 of the Bill must allow for a situation where a woman does not have the capacity to make decisions in regard to these services. That is why the wording is slightly different from that of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. In some cases a family member or a carer, rather than the woman herself, will have to make decisions about GP or other services. Again, we are trying to ensure that all care provided will be most appropriate to the needs of each participant. I reiterate that the Government is committed to implementing all of the commitments we made to the Magdalen women. The Government will implement all of Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations in full. I believe there is broad support in this House for all of the measures that the Government has decided to put in place for these women. In drafting the Bill the Government has had regard to points made by Senators and Deputies in representations. I commend the Bill to the House and will very much look forward to discussing it with the Senators.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senators for their comments on the Bill, the purpose of which is to implement the recommendations made in the report of the Magdalen Commission which was chaired by Mr. Justice Quirke. The Bill relates to medical card and health service provision for the women concerned. The recommendations in this regard are contained on page 35 of Mr. Justice Quirke's report. The Bill provides fully and comprehensively for the health services recommended by him. I ask Senators to read the report, in particular page 35, if they are in any doubt about what the Government is doing about it. I will list the health services recommended which include GP, medical and surgical services, drugs, medicines and surgical appliances, nursing services, home help services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, counselling services, chiropody and physiotherapy services. With regard to GP services, the women concerned will be able to choose any registered GP, not just one contracted to the HSE under the normal medical card scheme. The choice will rest with them. The Bill also provides them with an exemption from charges for acute inpatient services, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. Furthermore, it provides that payments to them arising from the scheme of ex gratia payments will not be included in any financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is fully in accordance with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke. The other services Mr. Justice Quirke recommends in his report are also being provided in full, but these elements do not require further legislation and, therefore, do not form part of the Bill. The fact that this is not included in the Bill does not mean that it is not being done. These other services are included in the scheme of ex gratia payments to women who were in the institutions which provides that the women concerned are eligible for a payment of between €11,500 and €100,000, depending on length of stay. To date, decisions have been made on 86% of the 776 applications received, while €18 million has been paid to date. There is provision for pension-type top-up payments of €100 weekly for those under pension age and up to €230 weekly when aged 66 years or over, depending on other State payments. These payments are already being made by the Department of Social Protection.  The women concerned are already covered for the appointment of a care representative under section 21 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Mr. Justice Quirke recommended provision be made for a mechanism whereby a person could be appointed to act in the best interests of a woman where she lacked the capacity to do so. This is being done through the Assisted Decision-Masking (Capacity) Bill 2013 which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil. The Minister for Health has also agreed that, given the wide variation in health services in different countries, the issue of access to equivalent medical services for participants living abroad will be dealt with on an administrative basis by the HSE, as appropriate to the specific circumstances of the individual and the health system in her country of residence. We are dealing with two elements. There is a significant level of emotion when we discuss this issue I have heard the statements and public comments made by Members of the Oireachtas. I know that Members are coming from a position of compassion and caring in dealing with the injustice done to the women who were in the Magdalen laundry system, but in all honesty some of the statements made are not in keeping with the facts. Nothing was done about the issue by previous Governments which refused to touch it and would not go near it. The Government is implementing in full the recommendations made in the report of Mr. Justice Quirke, on which we need to work together. The whole sorry saga reeks of Ireland's attitude to women as second-class citizens which, in many instances, continues to this day.There are many aspects of our laws, legislation and provisions in the Constitution that need to be challenged. Members of this House need to assist Members of the other House in continuing to challenge mechanisms, legislation and realities in society that keep women, effectively, as second class citizens. In the other House, of which I am a Member, 86% of its membership is male which has a massive implication on the type of legislation and budgetary measures passed by this House.  I wish to mention a second matter, and give credit to this House in regard to this matter, namely, our love affair with the institutionalisation of people. That ranges from people with mental issues in the past, from the Magdalen laundries to the mother and baby homes, to industrial schools and our common cause in this House - the issue of direct provision. We have a lot of issues to deal with. On the issue of women's rights, we still have a huge amount to achieve and also in terms of our love affair with institutionalisation. I cannot let this opportunity pass without clarifying, as Senator John Gilroy quite accurately did in his contribution, that the Quirke report is being implemented in full. There can be a political temptation to try to find the negative in every piece of legislation but I appeal to Senators to look at the Bill as it actually is. If one compares it with the Quirke report one will find, in all fairness and taking away the temptation to turn this matter into a political football, that the Government is implementing the Quirke report in full. That is why I commend the Bill to the House. 
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senator David Cullinane for tabling the amendment which engages the House in a discussion of the matter. The Minister appreciates that this is one of a set of changes to the 2005 Garda Act that has been recommended by the Oireachtas joint committee. It was the view of the joint committee that having a single person commission could provide for greater accountability and strengthen its overall position. The Minister has considered the amendment carefully and, as she indicated during the Dáil debate on a similar amendment, there is more involved than merely a change to the number of the commissioners. In particular, she is conscious of the fact that there are certain practical advantages that flow from having a three-person body and she believes these must also be fully taken into account. In that context, she would recall for Senators that the underlying rationale for the establishment of the three-person model was that it would facilitate the bringing of expertise and experience across a range of different sectors to the work of the commission. In addition, it was also considered to be of practical advantage that at least one commissioner would always be available to guide and direct operations. At operational level, GSOC considers this to be a significant advantage in a working environment as unpredictable as that faced by the commission. Some of its most serious and sensitive cases have occurred at weekends or during holiday periods. Moreover, it is necessary to take account of the fact that a three-person commission, with its legally required gender balance and its range of experience and expertise, conveys a strong public assurance that fairness and sensitivity are at the core of GSOC's approach at the highest level. It also helps that potential differences between an individual commissioner and key interlocutors do not impinge on the smooth and effective running of the organisation. The Minister accepts that, up to recently, the interaction between the Garda Ombudsman Commission and An Garda Síochána has not been functioning as effectively as it should. This is an area in which substantial work is currently being undertaken by both organisations. Furthermore, and this is the primary purpose of the Bill we are debating, additional powers are in the process of being conferred on GSOC. In the circumstances, the Minister would be reluctant to alter the current GSOC structure unless it could be shown that a significant advantage would accrue from doing so. Having considered the overall position, including the fact that specific arrangements have been made for the commission, through a nominated member, to account to Oireachtas committees, the Minister would not currently favour moving to a one person commission. However, very conscious of the position of the joint committee on this matter, her view is that this is an aspect that needs to be kept under review going forward. The Senators will appreciate the consideration that has been given to the amendment and in the circumstances the Minister hopes they can withdraw it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senator for his contribution. The effect of the proposed amendments would be, in particular, to remove from the Minister for Justice and Equality the function, under section 96 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, of determining whether certain information or material could be made available to GSOC where matters of national security are involved. The Minister has considered the amendments carefully and she is of the clear view that, given that the security of the State is a priority function of the Government, the task of deciding whether information or material can be withheld on security grounds should remain with the Minister for Justice and Equality, in his or her capacity as a member of the Government. In regard to the Senators' amendments, the Minister emphasises the fact that it is incumbent on the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that the relevant functions, under section 96, are discharged properly and impartially. As Senators will be aware, this is one of a number of areas where important security-related matters are dealt with by the Minister, including authorising the interception of communications. One of the features of the Senators' amendments is that they involve a specific role for a member of the Judiciary. In that regard, the Minister has asked me to draw the attention of Senators to section 100 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. It provides for the appointment of a designated High Court judge to keep under review the operation of certain provisions of the Act, including section 96, that relate to the security of the State. The Minister believes these arrangements are prudent and provide a suitable level of judicial oversight. Accordingly, she does not believe that it would be appropriate to adopt the changes proposed by the Senators. In the circumstances, the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendments and ask the Senators not to press them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Section 7 inserts a new section 102B into the 2005 Act, which brings the Garda Commissioner within the scope of Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigations for the first time. This is a significant development and one to which the Government attaches a high degree of importance. That being said, it also must be borne in mind fully that in addition to carrying out her general policing functions, the Garda Commissioner is the head of the national security service. In the latter role, the Commissioner fulfils a vital function which is closely linked to the obligations of the Government to preserve the security of the State. Senators will be aware that the Minister, in response to the Dáil Committee Stage debate, had strengthened the provision of section 102B to provide a specific role for the Government, rather than just for the Minister, with regard to important decisions to be made under section 102B. To that end, the Dáil accepted the Minister's amendment, under which Government approval would be required before the Minister can consent to a GSOC investigation into the conduct of a Garda Commissioner, request GSOC to commence such an investigation or refuse to consent to a proposed GSOC investigation. In addition, the original text was strengthened further to ensure that in a situation in which a request from GSOC to undertake an investigation into the conduct of the Commissioner is being refused, this can only be done for stated reasons. The practical reality is that it would only be in exceptional cases that consent to a proposed investigation would not be given and in these circumstances, specific reasons would be provided. Furthermore, as the Minister stated, it is almost impossible to envisage any circumstances under which, on foot of a demonstrable concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct, consent would be withheld. As I have indicated, the requirement for Government approval of a ministerial decision under section 102B meets concerns expressed during the Dáil debates that there simply would be a ministerial veto on a GSOC investigation into the Garda Commissioner. Overall, because of the pivotal national security functions undertaken by the Commissioner, the Minister does not consider it to be appropriate to amend the Bill further in respect of ministerial consent. In the circumstances, the Minister asks the Senator not to press the amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On amendment No. 8, the Minister agrees fully that GSOC should have access to PULSE for the purposes of its investigations. However, I can assure Senators that at this stage, it is an aspect of co-operation that is being fully catered for operationally. While the Minister is aware that this is an area that has given rise to difficulties for GSOC in the past, the commission has confirmed to the Department of Justice and Equality that it is satisfied with the level of access to PULSE that is now being provided. As part of the processes involved, Garda training has been provided for GSOC personal. For the Minister's part, she believes it is appropriate that GSOC's access to the PULSE system should be provided within the general framework of the co-operation that takes place between An Garda Síochána and GSOC. This is specifically provided for in the 2005 Act and the Minister does not consider that there would be any particular advantage in making separate provision for one particular area where information is to be exchanged. In addition, legislating for access to a named information system as proposed has the potential to give rise to practical difficulties such as when that system is changed, integrated with other systems or decommissioned. In that regard, Members may be aware that the Garda Inspectorate has made significant recommendations with regard to the PULSE system. It is also important to stress that section 9 of the Bill contains a provision that will underpin any requirement on the Garda Commissioner to provide information for GSOC. That section inserts a new section 103A into the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and places a statutory obligation on the Commissioner to provide GSOC, as soon as practicable, with information that GSOC requires for the purposes of carrying out its functions. This observation applies fully to the PULSE system and has the advantage that it is equally applicable to any alterations that might be made to that system. In the circumstances, the Minister does not consider that a new legislative provision along the lines proposed is necessary and asks the Senator to withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The new section 103A being inserted into the 2005 Act by section 9 of the Bill places a statutory obligation on the Garda Commissioner to provide to GSOC any information that the commission needs for the purposes of the investigation of a complaint or any matters comprehended by sections 102 and 102B.The requirement is that the information will be provided to GSOC as soon as is practicable, that is, as soon as it is feasible to do so. This approach has been taken because it must be recognised that, inevitably, there will be situations where it will not be possible to adhere to specific deadlines. Such a case could occur where a key witness is not available or where a very large body of work must be undertaken. The Minister is aware that there have been situations where the amount of time taken to supply information or material to GSOC has been unacceptable. In that context, she is satisfied that the new provision is sufficient to ensure that GSOC will be able to obtain any necessary information within a period that is appropriate to the complexity of the information being sought. The Minister understands that there has been a significant improvement in the timeframe within which An Garda Síochána provides information for GSOC. Senators will appreciate that the new section 103A will further strengthen the current arrangements. The Minister is very much aware of the requirement for the speedy provision of information by An Garda Síochána to GSOC. In that regard, she is satisfied that section 103A will contribute positively to this requirement and, given the complexities involved, she will be keeping the position under review. In the circumstances the Minister asks the Senators not to press the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to be here on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald. As I indicated on Second Stage, the Government is fully is committed to implementing all of the recommendations made by Mr. Justice Quirke and will be providing all of the health services recommended in his report. I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 5. As I have stated, the women who were in Magdalen laundries will be able to avail of their GP of choice, whether he or she is a participant in the general medical card scheme or a fully private GP. However, if the Bill were amended as suggested and provided health services as outlined in section 2 of the 1996 Act, it would mean that chiropody and physiotherapy would not be provided in the Bill as there is no such provision in section 2 of the 1996 Act. Moreover, the counselling services in the Act are specifically described as counselling services in respect of hepatitis C. Since none of the women has hepatitis C, amendment No. 5 would be of no benefit to the women. The effect of these amendments would be to cause confusion and provide a more restricted service than is currently provided in section 2 of the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My responsibility and that of the Department is to implement fully the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke. I do not necessarily want to do this but there is a statement from JFM research, National Women's Council of Ireland, which sets out a list of things which are not in the Bill. Of the ten listed, Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9 flatly contradict the recommendations because they are provided for in the Bill. If people are going to send out statements on what is and is not in the Bill, I wish they would stick to the facts because it is easy to make a statement understanding how passionate and emotional people feel about this issue. Frankly, as the Senator is listing things that are not in the Bill, of course it will upset people. At first glance, that Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9 are wrong, is remarkable, and-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----No. 8 is not relevant yet. I will state categorically what our job is here. Mr. Justice Quirke recommends that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation with regard to the provision of health services. In his report Mr. Justice Quirke was of the opinion that the women of the Magdalen laundries should be provided with access to a comprehensive suite of health services. Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation that the women receive medical services equivalent to those provided by the holder of a HAA card has been given effect in this Bill. However, he also stated that not all of the services described in the hepatitis C guide may be directly relevant to the Magdalen women and any comparable guide for the Magdalen women would require suitable adaptation. This is Mr. Justice Quirke's report. It should be noted that the services provided in section 2 of the Bill are precisely those recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke on page 35 of his report. I ask Senators to compare the Bill with the report. They include general practitioner services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aid and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home supports, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy. All of these services are specified in section 2 and will be made available free of charge to the women who were in the Magdalen laundries. I appeal to Senators and those sending out press releases to look at the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They will have exactly the same facilities as the hepatitis C people; there is no difference according to the 1996 Act.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Obviously, my previous comments have been misconstrued by Senators. I do not want anybody who has gone through this lifetime abuse, if one wants to call it that, to have that situation compounded by misinformation. I sat through the debates in the Dáil, sitting beside officials and listening to contributions from people who clearly had not read a single word of the Bill. They walked into the Dáil and decided that whatever the Government was doing was wrong, and they got very hot and heavy and made speeches without referring to a single item in the Bill. Anyone on the outside watching this debate would assume the Government is not implementing the Quirke report and is implementing something completely different. A political opportunity was used by speakers in the Dáil in order to give that impression. This is my second time in the House discussing this Bill. What I am saying now is similar to what I was saying on the last occasion in respect of the provisions of this Bill. When it comes to dealing with legislation, I have to say that, on the various different issues, I have had very good interaction with the Members in this House. I assume we are on the same side on this. There comes a stage when the campaigning ends and the winning begins. That is the same in every single campaign that anybody has ever been involved in. There comes a stage when the winning begins. This Bill is where the winning begins in terms of what Mr. Justice Quirke has asked for. I cannot say more. I am not asking the Members to look at a press release from the Department of Justice and Equality or to look at a statement that Minister X, Y or Z has made. I am asking them to look at the green piece of paper they have all been given, which is the Bill in front of them, which they have been asked, as legislators, to pass through this esteemed House. The Bill states:Provision of health services without charge to relevant participants2. (1) The Health Service Executive shall make available without charge to relevant participants—(a) the general practitioner medical and surgical service specified in section 58 of the Act of 1970 [the same as with hepatitis C],(b) drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the time being on the Reimbursement List within the meaning of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 [as noted by Senator Moloney],(c) the nursing service specified in section 60 of the Act of 1970 [the same as with hepatitis C],(d) the home help service specified in section 61 of the Act of 1970, following an assessment of needs made by a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse that the service is so required [the same as with hepatitis C],(e) the dental, ophthalmic and aural services specified in section 67 of the Act of 1970 [the same as with hepatitis C],(f) a counselling service, following a referral made in that regard by a registered medical practitioner, relative to a relevant participant’s admission to and work in any of the institutions specified in the Schedule [the same as with hepatitis C],(g) a chiropody service... and(h) a physiotherapy service... [the same as with hepatitis C].All I am asking Senators to do is to look at what is in the Bill and to acknowledge that the only difference relates to quite specific circumstances which directly relate to hepatitis C and which do not relate to the Magdalen women. Mr. Justice Quirke's report is being implemented in full, and no Government, Parliament, Seanad or Dáil should stand over anything less. If I appear to be irritated by the misinformation, it is because I do not want people whose life experiences have been trawled through the media and in public comment in the last while, and who are trying to come to terms with their life experience, to have that situation compounded by misinformation and press releases and statements which are factually incorrect. I plead with Senators to look at the report and to look at the only bit of paper that is important in this context, namely, the Bill. I ask them to make their assessment, as myself and Senator Gilroy have done, by going through the subsections which list the ten services which we were told were not in the Bill but which we know are there because we have dissected them one by one. If Members do not believe me, I will make this offer. If the Cathaoirleach wants to adjourn the House for a few moments, if that is possible under the Order of Business, the officials here would be quite happy to nail down in a detailed manner the individual questions the Senators have. However, I would say this. I have been here before and have outlined this before. I would ask those who are making statements to refer to the Bill and we can get some really solid work done here today.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Some of the issues that were concerning Senators have been outlined by officials outside the Chamber. If the Senators have any remaining questions that they want put on the record of the House, I am quite happy to reply to them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the Senator asks a question, I will give a "Yes" or "No" answer.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The only difference is, as Senator Norris already outlined, the medication or services that were specific to hepatitis C. That is the only difference because it would not be relevant to the Magdalen women. That is the only reason and it is the only change.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I concur completely with Senator O'Donnell's understanding. I can confirm that Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's understanding is completely correct as well, in terms of dental and ophthalmic services. The only difference is that some of these provisions in relation to hepatitis C are not relevant to Magdalen laundries. That is the only reason. There is no other motivation behind the changes in legislation. Whatever the women were entitled to in terms of hepatitis C, the Magdalen women are also absolutely entitled to, as is correct. The only difference is for certain circumstances and certain services which are not relevant because they are specific to women who were suffering from hepatitis C.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the last point, some of these payments are made over a continuing period until the ladies pass away so it is not as if we have to continue with these payments. The remarks about the Justice for Magdalenes group are well made. It has done sterling work and has been campaigning on a great injustice that was done to these women for a very long time. It is an Ireland to which none of us ever wants to return. When we debated this issue previously, I said there are many issues that still have to be dealt with in Ireland, particularly about the status of women, and also our love affair with institutionalising people which we still do to this day. We have spoken previously in this House on issues in this regard. When a press release or a statement, which is factually incorrect, is issued, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, I have to point to what is correct and what is incorrect. We have to refer to the Bill. I would make the point that there is in all things in life and in politics a time when the campaigning ends and winning begins. I genuinely feel that this is where the winning is beginning for women who deserve no less from the State. It is the intention for these provisions to be made available a month after the Bill is signed into law by the President. We have lost another week but if that week makes Senators more at ease with the Bill that is passing, then it is a week worth taking.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I agree with the views expressed by Senators that the service would be a very useful facility to provide to Magdalen women who have capacity issues. The Department of Justice and Equality is in discussion with the Citizens Information Board with regard to the provision of personal advocacy services to Magdalen women and will have further discussions with the Department of Social Protection in this regard. Section 5 of the 2007 Act has not yet been commenced and will require commencement in order for such a service to be provided.While I believe it is important to make the option of advocacy available to women who need it, it is also important to recognise that the role of a personal advocate under the 2007 Act is limited to assisting an individual to apply for a social service. The personal advocate does not have power of attorney or cannot otherwise manage the affairs of an individual. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, to which the Senator refers will provide an important additional safeguard for some of the Magdalen women who need more than an advocacy service. The Committee Stage debate on this Bill, which makes detailed provision in respect of a range of options - including decision-making assistance, co-decision makers, decision-making representatives and the public guardian - is due to be taken in the Dáil. The provisions to which I refer will cater more fully for the range of situations likely to arise in respect of Magdalen women who have capacity issues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senators' points are well made and we will do the best we can in that regard.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Again, I take on board the points made by the Senators. We will hopefully have more to say in respect of this issue on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«While I understand the motivation behind the amendment, unfortunately I cannot accept it. This is because it would make no sense for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to be asked to report if the Bill is used to implement the ex gratia scheme, when that scheme is not contemplated by the legislation at all. As the Senators are aware, the recommendations in regard to the scheme have been already implemented in full and as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. All women who worked in the relevant institutions receive payments of between €11,500 and €100,000, depending on the length of time they spend in those institutions. They also receive top-up payments to ensure their weekly State benefits of up to €100 until they reach 66 years of age and then the equivalent of the State contributory pension, €230.30 per week, for the remainder of their lives. To date, more than €18 million has been paid out and payments will continue to be made to the women for the rest of their lives. The Bill makes provision for all of the health services recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke but it does not implement the ex gratia scheme or various other things recommended by him. I reiterate that all of the recommendations made by Mr. Justice Quirke will be implemented in full and that the introduction of legislation will not be required in most instances.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This House has a proud record of pursuing issues that are of importance to it. We have engaged in an informative and robust debate on the Bill today. I would be both proud and honoured to return to the House at any time - at the invitation of Senators - to discuss any aspect of the legislation or the ex gratia payments being made to the women. I am sure also the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, would be happy to come here to discuss any relevant matters with Senators.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are enough avenues within the Houses of the Oireachtas for Members to hold the Government to account and to find out facts and figures in terms of the payments and how the provisions of the Bill are being implemented. I refer, for example, to parliamentary questions, the Topical Issue debate, or in this House by means of a Private Members' motion, commencement debate or other means. I do not believe an amendment to the Bill is necessary in this regard. I am quite sure Members of the Oireachtas have lots of avenues to hold the Government to account, and likewise the Bill, and to allow for Members to stand up in various ways to ensure the women get what they are entitled to.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I have a formal statement on the implementation of the national integration strategy which I propose to read before commenting on the PolskaÉire 2015 festival. Before I begin, I take the opportunity to thank Shane Long for scoring the equaliser in the last minute of Sunday evening's game. The Government parties are criticised for many things and I suppose the Labour Party could have been criticised for increasing the motivation of the Polish soccer team to do well on home soil, as it were, on Sunday last. I was delighted, in the context of the stability of the Government, that Shane Long managed to score his last minute goal. I welcome the motion and thank the House for giving me the opportunity to provide an update on where we stand in the development of the revised national integration strategy. A Private Members' motion on racism agreed by the Seanad in June 2014 called on the Minister to report back to the House on these matters. This is an opportune time to provide some further information on developments in this area. As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to the promotion of polices which integrate minority ethnic groups in Ireland, including those policies which promote social inclusion, equality, diversity and the participation of immigrants in the economic, social, political and cultural life of their communities. The Government recognises the importance and value of the many new communities that are now an integral part of Irish society. The importance of these groups was recognised and underscored in a tangible manner through the assignment, in July last year, of specific responsibilities for new communities to a Minister of State. The assignment of responsibilities in this manner helps ensure that issues of importance to new communities are highlighted appropriately. I am sure Senators will be aware that we are in the process of reviewing Ireland's strategy on integration. This follows a decision which was taken by the Cabinet committee on social policy early last year. The work on this review is being carried forward by a cross-departmental committee of senior officials and it is chaired by a senior official in my Department. The mandate of the cross-departmental group includes the following specific tasks - to review the activities being undertaken by Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of non-Irish nationals; the preparation of a draft overarching integration strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented; and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. An important part of the work of the group was to engage in a meaningful way with members of the public. In order to do this, a two-fold approach was undertaken by the committee. The first step was to place a call in media outlets inviting submissions from interested parties who wished to contribute to the work of the group. The closing date for contributions was May 2014 and I am delighted to say more than 80 submissions were received from a wide range of organisations and groups providing services to migrants. The second phase of the consultation process was a series of face-to-face meetings with some of those who contributed material for consideration by the group. Five consultation sessions were held, with each session lasting one day and involving a series of sub-meetings with members of the public. A total of 27 separate groups, one individual and a group of seven individuals met with the cross-departmental group during these sessions. This segment of the consultative process facilitated the highlighting of, and in-depth discussions on, issues of particular concern. They also permitted those contributors present the opportunity of imparting their personal experiences to the committee. I understand those who participated in these meetings, both from the official side and the non-government side, found these face-to-face interactions to be valuable. Separate to the above process, the cross-departmental group also held a series of thematic meetings which addressed particular issues. The topics discussed during these meetings included promoting inter-cultural awareness and combating racism and xenophobia; education; social inclusion and access to public services; employment and pathways to work; and active citizenship. In addition, suggestions which were made in the context of written contributions have been collated and circulated to the relevant Departments and associated agencies for consideration. Work on the development of the updated integration strategy is ongoing and I expect that a draft strategy will be sent to key stakeholders for their observations before the summer, with a view to the strategy being published as soon as possible thereafter. I hope that the resulting recommendations on migrant integration will form the basis of a new and more comprehensive overarching strategy, which is capable of meeting present needs and expected future conditions of society. According to Census 2011, we have a situation where non-Irish nationals account for more than 500,000 or 12% of the population and where there has been a rapid growth in the non-Irish population in the past decade or so. We now have people from more than 199 countries living in the State. This can pose challenges but it can also provide opportunities. There have, unfortunately, been circumstances where individuals have experienced racism and xenophobia. I want to be clear in expressing my views on such behaviour - it is not acceptable and we will do everything possible to combat it. I am aware there have been calls for the legislation on racism to be reviewed and this issue is a topic which is being looked at by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in terms of its ongoing work on integration, multiculturalism and combating racism. I fully expect that the legislation to combat racism will be considered in the context of the outcome of the review of the Oireachtas committee and following publication of the Government's integration strategy. In the meantime, I urge those who are affected by manifestations of racism to report the matter to the appropriate authorities. I am aware of the excellent work that NGOs in this sector have been doing in providing support and assistance for those who have been victims of racism, for which I commend them. Of equal importance is their advocacy role in opposition to racism and in seeking to keep the focus of Government and of society generally on this problem. I am pleased that the motion commends the holding of the PolskaÉire Festival 2015. This is an initiative I have had in mind for some time because I saw it as important to recognise the Polish influence in present day Ireland. It is estimated that there are 150,000 Polish citizens living in the State, resulting in Polish becoming the second most widely spoken language here. It also seemed to me to be a worthwhile exercise in furthering integration of Poles in Irish society and promoting contact between Irish, Polish and other nationalities, through a range of cultural, artistic, social, sports and other events and catering for different age groups. I thought it would be a good idea if the festival was organised on the occasion of the Republic of Ireland v. Poland international, and that proved to be the case. I arranged for funding for elements of the festival from the two Departments in which I am Minister of State. However, I thank the Polish Embassy, the FAI, Dublin City Council and other local authorities, the Irish-Polish Society, Polish associations such as Forum Polonia, sports clubs, SIPTU and cultural groups across the country - in short, anyone and everyone who organised events or participated in what was a successful festival. Despite what other members of my party might say, RTE was particularly supportive of the events last week.  With regard to the amendment tabled by Senators David Cullinane, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly, as Senators will be aware, I have a personal commitment to reforming the direct provision system. Alongside my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I established a working group on the protection process. The work of this group is ongoing and it will report back in the coming weeks with a suggested path of reforms. However, I cannot accept the amendment. Indeed, some of the matters referred to fall outside my remit in the Department. I appreciate that these are important issues and if the Senators want to outline their concerns in writing to me, I will ensure that they are brought to the attention of the Minister. On a personal note, I thank those who were involved in the festival, which has become the first PolskaÉire Festival. It was intended to be a once-off occasion because it would centre around the soccer international but that changed over the course of the week of the events, which are still ongoing because there are events around the country and the film festival in Smithfield this week has all of a sudden become the first Polish-Irish festival. There is a new plaque on O'Connell Street to Pawe Edmund Strzelecki, who did a massive amount of famine relief work here in the 1840s and is credited with saving the lives of 200,000 children in Ireland during that period. The plaque, a monument, if one likes, to the PolskaÉire Festival, will last for a long time, and great credit is due to the Irish-Polish Society for organising it. We always have had people come to this country who have contributed to Ireland. One can go back to St. Patrick. One can look at the seven signatories to the Proclamation, two of whom were born outside Ireland and two others of whom were sons of migrants. It is a fantastic opportunity for us. As I have said this on quite a number of occasions, I feel sorry for the Polish representatives in the Gallery who have heard so many similar speeches of mine in the past ten days or so, but, if I might, I will continue along that vein. The country that I grew up in was a particularly boring, stale, mono-cultural one, a country that people wanted to leave. Many of us in this House will have friends and family living abroad who have found a country outside of Ireland that they decided to call home. I was taken by something an Italian Minister said at an EU event recently, that he wanted Italy to be the best place in the world for Italian-born people. That is something we have to do for ourselves in the hope Ireland might be the best place in which Irish people can live. However, from a situation where, in 1996, 0.5% of the population were born outside the State, now 12% were. It is a wonderfully enriching and exciting for us to have that shared experience. The thousands of years of history that have brought the Polish nation to this point is now our history too. While the Polish people go through a period of reflection on the 70 years since the end of the Second World War and we are going through our period of reflection, I am so excited about the new identity of being Polish-Irish. I said this on quite a few occasions that we are so used to the idea of being Irish-American but we have never necessarily come to the realisation that there is a whole new body of people in the country who are comfortable with the idea of being Hungarian-Irish, Czech-Irish, Moldovan-Irish or Polish-Irish. We have started something wonderful with this conversation this week. We talked with young people about where they are with that internal friction between two identities and how they can celebrate it and move on from it. We have spoken about integration through sport, which, as Senator Hayden stated, is a fantastic avenue in which to connect and build bridges. We have used art and music. We have focused, not only on the constraints of a national identity but on what a national identity can do in terms of connecting with another human being.National identity is important, but one's humanity supersedes all of those elements. I thank Senators for allowing us discuss the nature of integration. I agree we have problems and issues to overcome. People have mentioned the issue of direct provision and that is something we discussed at the joint committee earlier today. There are obviously issues to be discussed in regard to the protection system. Not everybody has the same mindset when it comes to the issue of migration and our political system does not give itself enough credit for its achievements. Look for example at what is happening across the water in the British general election and how immigration is front and centre of that debate. Look too at what is happening in France and Germany. The European Union is under a greater strain now, despite being the greatest political movement of the past 100 years and bringing people together with the common goal for a peaceful Europe. Our system, regardless of political party affiliations, has not been strangled by the issue of immigration and we should hold on to, cherish and build on this for the future.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Maybe sausages.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the topic of mortgages and receivers. This issue forms part of the overall context of mortgage arrears and it should be recognised that things are improving in this area. There has been a welcome increase in engagement between borrowers and lenders which has resulted in over 115,000 sustainable restructured solutions being put in place. In addition, this year we have seen an improvement in the numbers of people availing of the services provided by the Insolvency Service of Ireland. It should be acknowledged that the majority of solutions reached through the ISI have resulted in successful outcomes for the borrower. The Government recognises that the level of mortgage arrears is a significant economic and social challenge, and is acutely aware of the difficulties some borrowers are facing in meeting their mortgage commitments. The Government is committed to continuing to address this issue as a priority. The Government is fully aware that high levels of personal debt threaten the participation of individuals and families in the current economic recovery. We have already taken decisive action in a number of areas in order to assist people in mortgage arrears difficulties, such as the introduction of the personal insolvency legislation; the provision of the mortgage arrears advice and information helpline; and the provision of independent financial advice for borrowers on the terms of the restructure arrangements offered to them by their lender. The Government is currently reviewing the operation of personal insolvency legislation and the independent advice service offered to distressed borrowers with a view to strengthening those initiatives. In addition, the mortgage to rent scheme - under which the borrower surrenders the property to the lender who then sells the property to an approved housing body which then becomes the landlord allowing people to stay in the family home - is being reviewed with a view to improving the scheme to ensure that it is available in suitable cases. As Senators will be aware, the Government has already made it clear that it will shortly be announcing a package of measures to support the existing framework and improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions. The overall aim of the Government's approach to this issue remains the same as it has always been, which is to ensure that a full range of options is available to distressed borrowers and to keep as many people in their homes as possible. The appointment of a receiver over mortgaged property is one of the remedies available to a lending institution in cases of mortgage default. It is important to note at the outset, however, that this is a remedy that applies in the main to commercial property, which may include buy-to-let residential property and farmland. It does not, therefore, apply to the principal dwellings of defaulting borrowers. It is important to bear in mind that the properties to which receivers are appointed are not those covered by the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears which seeks to ensure that lending institutions act in a scrupulously fair manner and exercise appropriate forbearance, in the case of principal dwellings. The appointment of a receiver is normally an alternative to the lender seeking actual repossession of the mortgaged property. Instead of taking possession, a receiver is appointed to manage the property. In the case of a shop, restaurant or licensed premises, the goal may be to achieve more efficient management and operation of a viable business; in the case of buy-to-let residential property, the intention is more often to collect rental income produced by the property and to divert it towards servicing the mortgage. A power to appoint a receiver in cases of mortgage default is set out in section 108 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009. It largely reproduces a much earlier provision on the same lines in the Conveyancing Act 1881. These powers are exercisable by the lender without recourse to the courts. In such cases, the receiver's role is limited to receiving income produced by the mortgaged property. The receiver is generally also required to manage the property. The mortgage contracts applicable to commercial property loans normally contain more detailed contractual terms concerning the appointment of receivers. They may, for example, grant the receiver more extensive powers, such as power to manage the property, lease it or sell it. These provisions form part of the terms and conditions on which the loan is granted by the lending institution concerned and, again, may be exercisable without recourse to the courts. While the Private Members' motion refers to the lack of regulation exposing borrowers to oppressive and wrongful conduct by receivers, I am not aware of any widespread concerns over the matter. Receivers are normally accountants or solicitors and are subject both to the regulatory and disciplinary regime applicable to their professions and the law of the land. I do not, therefore, accept the notion that the lack of a specific licensing regime leaves the public at risk of abuse by unscrupulous receivers.That said, the Minister is aware from media reports - this has been referred to by Senators and in the Dáil debate recently - of particular cases in which tensions appear to have arisen where receivers are seeking to take control of mortgaged property. These appear to be isolated exceptions to the general behaviour of receivers. Let me make it clear that the Minister condemns the use of heavy-handed actions by receivers in this type of instance and deplores the use of men with dogs and balaclavas turning up in the middle of the night to effect a repossession, as highlighted in recent reports. The Minister is conscious that the appointment of a receiver over mortgaged property is likely to be both traumatic and stressful for the borrowers involved or any tenant who may be living in the affected properties. In many cases, their hopes and dreams of building a successful business for themselves and their children may have been dashed by events beyond their control. In other cases, what seemed at the time like an attractive investment opportunity has not been a success and the lives of many are badly affected as a result. The Minister, therefore, urges receivers to act with tact and consideration and to avoid heavy-handed actions. They must act within the limits of the laws governing their appointment when exercising their powers. The provision of adequate information on their role and statutory tasks for those likely to be affected is particularly important. In this context, the Minister notes that the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland has produced the helpful A Residential Tenant's Guide to Receivership which provides appropriate information for tenants affected by the appointment of a receiver for a buy-to-let property. The provision of a similar guide to cover other cases of receivership would, the Minister believes, be helpful and I understand she intends to write to the federation in this regard. Receivers must act within the law of the land. The proceedings in which they take control of property are, first and foremost, civil proceedings to which the Garda is not a party. There may be situations where gardaí become aware or are notified that property is to be the subject of enforcement proceedings and, in these circumstances, it is an operational matter for Garda management to assess whether a Garda presence is advisable so as to prevent any risk of a breach of the peace. Preserving public order is an essential task of An Garda Síochána, whether in circumstances relating to repossession, the appointment of a receiver or otherwise. Where gardaí attend in these circumstances, it is important to understand they do not generally have a role in the process itself and are not in a position to act in any way as an arbiter in the proceedings. There may be some confusion on this point in the public mind, but this is the legal position and the Garda is very clear about this when present in such circumstances. Issues of difference or difficulty in the enforcement of a court order or contractual obligations between parties are matters for the parties concerned to resolve before the courts. Tensions can also arise where, for whatever reason, attempts are made to obstruct receivers in discharging their duties. Where a breach of the peace occurs in such cases, provisions in public order and related legislation are applicable. Similarly, where an individual has concerns that a criminal action may have been committed by any person in the course of such proceedings, this is a matter which An Garda Síochána will investigate. The Minister appreciates the intent behind this Private Members' motion but considers that it must be opposed, mainly because the remedies put forward in the motion cannot be put in place. I note that the motion calls on the Minister to amend the rules of the superior courts and the Circuit Court to include new provisions regulating the conduct of receivers appointed by the courts. The general position is that court rules are made under the relevant statutory provisions by the respective rules committees, not by the Minister for Justice and Equality. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the Minister to intervene in the manner suggested in the motion. In addition, the House should note that where a receiver is appointed by a court, he or she becomes an officer of the court, is answerable to the court and required to act in the interests of all the parties involved. Again, the Minister would not have any function in this area. The Minister is aware that there is the possibility that a receiver appointed over a mortgaged property is not a member of a regulated professional organisation and, therefore, not subject to the codes of conduct and ethics which would apply if he or she was a member. In such a circumstance the Minister believes it would be reasonable to put in place some rules and regulations governing their actions. For that reason, she has asked me to inform the House that she will be undertaking an analysis of the issue to examine whether further regulations should be introduced to govern the conduct of receivers. This analysis will, inter alia, examine the remedies put forward in this private Members' motion. The intention is to produce a report for discussion at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to allow the committee, on the basis of the analysis and its own examination of the issues involved, to consider what recommendation it would make as regards action to be taken. I again thank Senators for raising this issue. I look forward to listening to the rest of the debate.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I apologise for the delay as I was responding to a debate in the Dáil. I am pleased to address Members of the Seanad on my new role within the Department of Health, aligned to my responsibilities in the Departments of Justice and Equality and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in regard to the national drugs strategy. I wish to update the House on my priorities in advancing this agenda. I am delighted to be afforded the opportunity to undertake this role. I see it as a vital role that needs the attention of a dedicated Minister. My experience as a teacher and principal in Dublin's north inner city taught me all about the horrors of drug abuse and the need to tackle the effects that it can have on the individual, their families and communities. I am deeply committed to doing all I can, as Minister of State, to reduce the damage that drug use causes to individuals and to wider Irish society. Problem drug use continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing our country. It results in damaging consequences for the individual concerned and for their families and it also impacts the wider community and society on multiple levels. Directly or indirectly, every community is affected by drug abuse and addiction. Those struggling with drug problems are often the most marginalised in our society. They may have multiple, complex and interlocking needs such as poverty, housing, poor health and education, which require multiple interventions involving a range of different agencies. Consequently, the national drugs strategy aims to promote inter-agency working in a difficult cross-cutting policy and service area. Its overall objective is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars, which are: supply reduction; prevention; treatment; rehabilitation; and research. The strategy is based on a co-ordinated approach across many Departments and agencies, in conjunction with the community and voluntary sectors. We are beginning work on a successor to the current strategy, about which I will speak in more detail later. The national drugs prevalence survey 2010-11 provided key data on drug prevalence in Ireland. For example, levels of illegal drug use were mainly stable in Ireland between 2006-07 and 2010-11. Some 7% of all adults reported using any illegal drug in the year prior to the survey; cannabis was the most commonly used illegal drug and 6% of all adults reported using the drug in the year prior to the survey; 6.5% reported using sedatives and tranquillisers in the year prior to the survey; and 5% reported using anti-depressants in the same period. This survey is currently being repeated and the information gathered will inform future policy direction and contribute to the development of the new strategy.Unfortunately, because of the nature of the particular issue, we do not have good data on heroin usage in Ireland. The national advisory committee on drugs and alcohol is undertaking a survey which will provide us with useful estimates of heroin usage. Even without this data, I am satisfied that heroin represents a substantial element of our drugs problem and I am determined to find the most effective ways to address this scourge. The scale and nature of the drug problem in Ireland is constantly evolving. We need to maintain our focus on combating this serious problem. It is also useful to acknowledge some areas where significant progress has been made in recent years. Prevention and awareness programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem. The social, personal and health education programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drug and alcohol issues in schools. I know from my own experience as a teacher and principal that maximising school completion rates is central to the prevention of potential problem drug and alcohol use. In addition, research shows that having a positive experience of school and learning is a major protective factor that reduces the risk of substance use. As well as providing substance use education in schools, young people at risk of drug misuse are supported through diversionary programmes providing facilities and services and are offered family support. Very significant investment is being made in the Garda youth diversion programme. It seeks to divert at risk young people from becoming involved in criminal behaviour, including drug-related crime, and in preventing their succumbing to drug misuse. My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, recently announced that an additional €2.8 million has been secured under dormant assets funding. The funding will enable a further ten new Garda youth diversion projects to be established in targeted areas. This will bring to 110 the total number of youth diversion projects in operation nationwide. Achieving improved health outcomes for people with addiction issues is a key priority in the HSE service plan for 2015. In recent years, the HSE has placed a particular emphasis on ensuring appropriate treatment services are provided, on a timely basis, for service users. Waiting times for access to services, particularly outside Dublin, have been considerably reduced. At the end of December 2014, over 97% of clients over the age of 18 accessed treatment within one calendar month of assessment, while 100% of those under 18 received treatment within one week. Additional funding of €2.1 million has been provided in the HSE's budget for 2015, which includes an additional 53 beds, creating 439 new treatments. There is now comprehensive coverage of needle exchange services across the country. The expansion of needle exchange outside Dublin, with the support of funding from the Elton John Aids Foundation, has resulted in the recruitment and training of over 130 community pharmacies. I recently attended a presentation by the HSE on how this programme is operated and I was impressed by the success of the initiative to date. In fact, during 2014 over 42,000 packs which contained over 240,000 needles were given out. Approximately 9,800 people are availing of opioid substitution treatment. The number of new entrants to treatment, whose main problem drug is heroin, is in decline. However, in recent years the rise in polydrug use, including alcohol and prescription medication, has become an increasing cause for concern. I welcome the HSE-led project on naloxone which was launched in recent days. Naloxone is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone in some overdoses. This innovative project involves training lay persons such as the family and friends of a drug user, in the administration of a naloxone injection to overdose victims. Research shows that providing increased access to naloxone for people likely to witness an overdose is an effective way of reducing overdose deaths. I have no doubt that lives will be saved as a result of this initiative. Every drug-related death is a tragedy for the families and friends of the person involved and has a considerable impact on communities and society as a whole. The provision of naloxone to those most at risk and their families is a real step in the right direction. We also need to consider the introduction of medically supervised injecting rooms. There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere. This creates a public nuisance and is unhygienic and unsafe for drug users. There are supervised injecting facilities in a number of other countries and it is a policy I am very interested in. Last week, I received a draft legislative proposal from Ana Liffey and the Bar Council's voluntary assistance scheme which would allow for the provision of such services. I welcome the initiative and I have asked my officials to examine the practical and legal issues surrounding the proposal. A longitudinal drug treatment outcome study measuring the effectiveness of opioid treatment, called the Research Outcome Study in Ireland or ROSIE study, showed that drug treatment works. Significant reductions are shown in the key outcome areas of drug use, involvement in crime and in injecting drug use. In terms of drug supply reduction, the drug market and associated crime has a particularly corrosive impact on Irish communities, whether that is by virtue of gangland crime and related murders or through the intimidation imposed on local communities by those involved in drug crime. Our criminal justice agencies continue to play a significant role in seeking to address the many challenges faced in tackling such drug-related criminal activity. Our law enforcement response in targeting those involved in drug trafficking remains an important feature of our overall approach in addressing the drugs issue. The continued disruption of the supply of illicit drugs remains a key priority area which is reflected in the Garda Síochána's policing plan for 2015. Work in this area is being led by the recently merged Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. The bureau works with dedicated drug units across the country and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau and targets those involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. The specific strategies put in place by An Garda Síochána to address drug supply include the operation of targeted intelligence-led initiatives focused on particular aspects of the drugs trade. A further feature of our policing response is An Garda Síochána's ongoing close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners' Customs service and with other national drug law enforcement agencies such as the Health Products Regulatory Authority in tackling drug supply. At an international level, An Garda Síochána has strategic partnerships in place targeting drug trafficking, including working closely with relevant law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol. Last November, I was delighted to attend and speak at a successful major global conference that was held in Dublin which focused on tackling pharmaceutical crime. The conference was jointly hosted by Interpol, An Garda Síochána and the Health Products Regulatory Authority. In addition, the national drugs strategy includes a number of specific actions which target related aspects of drug crime. For example, the problem of drug-related threats and intimidation has been the subject of increasing concern. The Government is determined to tackle this form of criminality which has a detrimental effect on families, communities and society as a whole. Under the strategy, a framework for tackling this particular problem has been put in place by An Garda Síochána. The drug-related intimidation programme has been established by the Garda national drugs unit in conjunction with the community based national family support network. The purpose of this programme is to respond to the needs of drug users, their family members and-or friends who experience drug-related intimidation to repay drug debts. While good progress has been made, much work remains to be done. Problem drug users are individuals with their own individual needs. We must focus on their health needs and continue to promote the recovery of problem drug users, help them reintegrate into society and reach their full potential. This means services having a common vision on recovery and working together through a client-centred approach to foster client progression. All services need to get behind the national drugs rehabilitation framework which is being rolled out across the country, with the support of the drug and alcohol task forces. The framework aims to ensure a continuum of care for the recovering drug user through promoting a client centred approach to rehabilitation across the spectrum of services and based on shared care planning. Drug misuse is associated with a wide array of negative physical and mental health outcomes that are exacerbated with advancing age. Ireland has an ageing population of people in opiate substitution treatment. The needs of this cohort pose unique challenges for services and underline the need for joined-up interagency working. In 2012, there were 633 drug-related deaths in Ireland, which is a small decline in the overall number of drug-related deaths when compared with the 2011 figures. The number of deaths in which heroin was involved also continues to decline. Nevertheless, drug-related deaths still remain at an unacceptable level and every death is a tragedy. Evidence shows that those who are out of treatment are approximately three times more likely to die than those who are stable in treatment. Accordingly, we need to redouble our efforts to get people into treatment and on a recovery pathway. Alcohol causes significant damage across the population, in workplaces, to children and creates a substantial burden on all in Irish society. The Government is committed to taking action to protect the health and well-being of the wider public, especially children, from alcohol use. A comprehensive and detailed package of measures has been approved to address the problem. The general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill was published last February and the Bill is being drafted.The Minister for Health intends to have the Bill before the summer recess and to introduce it in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn. The legislation is the most far-reaching proposed by any Irish Government, with alcohol being addressed for the first time as a public health measure. The Bill is part of a comprehensive suite of measures to reduce excessive patterns of alcohol consumption, as set out in the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is leading the implementation of this strategy. In March this year, the Minister for Health brought forward emergency legislation to deal with an adverse Court of Appeal decision regarding the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The purpose of this Act is to prevent the misuse of dangerous or otherwise harmful substances, and it does so by declaring substances to be controlled under the Act and then imposing a range of controls on substances depending on their therapeutic or other value and their potential for misuse. The type of control provided for includes controls on possession, supply, importation and exportation, cultivation, licensing, administration, record-keeping, prescription-writing, destruction and safe custody of controlled drugs. The Act also establishes offences and penalties for non-compliance. Substances may be controlled by two mechanisms: either by being listed in the Schedule to the Act, or by being declared controlled by means of a Government order made under section 2(2). It was this section which the Court of Appeal ruling declared unconstitutional. The court found that while it was appropriate for the Oireachtas to delegate the power to the Government to declare substances to be controlled, the Act did not offer sufficient guidance to the Government in its exercise of this power. The ruling had the effect of decontrolling all substances that had been controlled by Government order, including ecstasy, new psychoactive substances and benzodiazepines. This meant it was no longer an offence to possess these substances. The Oireachtas passed emergency legislation on 11 March to restore the controls on such substances by placing these in the Schedule to the Act. In addition, emergency legislation, namely the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015, confirmed a number of ministerial orders and regulations made under the Act. This means that those orders and regulations are as if they were an Act of the Oireachtas and cannot be amended or revoked without primary legislation. My aim in the coming months is to bring forward another Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to control substances anew, thereby meeting our EU and international obligations to control substances that are dangerous and have the potential for abuse. Furthermore, the Bill will clarify the provisions under which Ministerial orders and regulations are made. This will once again allow regulations to be made and, if necessary and appropriate, to impose stricter or less strict controls on substances which are already covered under the legislation. As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I will be leading the development of the drugs strategy for the period after 2016. My intention in the coming months is to lay the groundwork for a concise and focused policy, placing a clear emphasis on the practical implementation of actions. The other consideration is the optimum timeframe for the new strategy, bearing in mind the evolving nature of the drugs phenomenon. This work will include an assessment of the extent to which the current strategy has provided an effective policy response to the drug problem. An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will also help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches that might be considered in an Irish context. I intend to consult widely and to meet all groups and stakeholders concerned with the drugs issue. I want to listen to the concerns of those affected, and I am particularly keen to hear from young people, service users and their families. I also want to hear from Members of this House who have an interest in and concern about this area.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it naloxone?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is called Suboxone.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Members for their good wishes and the constructive comments most Senators made. My commitment was questioned, however, and the manner of my delivery was criticised. I promise to work on this in the future. I always know when somebody has very little to say about a topic; they tend to focus on the Minister’s delivery. Unfortunately, it is not just outside the school gates that there tends to be some drug dealing going on but within the schools too. We have to be mindful of the stresses and strains that teachers are constantly undergoing in this regard. On the glamorous lifestyle that seems to be attached to the drugs trade, as I have often said, if one locks a child out of mainstream society and they do not get respect from it, they will find a parallel economy and a way of getting empowerment and prestige. The drugs trade is glamorous, lucrative and exciting, and gets one cheap and easy money. There is a challenge in the education system and in wider society to tackle this issue. Senator Colm Burke asked about the use of Suboxone to treat drug addiction. There is not a legislative blockage as such, but we will need regulations because we are dealing with a small cohort of people for whom Suboxone is being prescribed. Further regulations will be needed in the Bill to expand on this. There has been a reduction in funding for the local drugs task forces, but nowhere near 80%. The Irish Times clarified that this was not the case. It has been 9.8% in the past nine years. While no one wants to defend such a reduction, it is the reality of what the entire country went through for several years. In fact, every drugs task force got an extra €48,000 this year. I concur with Senator Ivana Bacik about putting the emphasis on harm reduction. It is welcome that the justice committee is going to Portugal. Portugal had a different approach when it came to decriminalising drugs. When I use that term, I want to make it clear that I am not talking about legalisation. Those are two very different things. We have to come back to the research and wonder why 70% of those going through the courts for drugs offences were found in possession of amounts for personal use. This seems to be a complete waste of Garda time and the time of the Courts Service. It is primarily a health issue for those with addictions or problems, not a criminal justice issue, and that is the way in which it should be tackled. The issue of class was raised. In my experience, drugs are everywhere. Neither is it just a Dublin issue. It affects other urban centres and rural areas. As I have said before, middle-class families have ways of hiding drug addiction and drug problems in a way that working-class people sometimes cannot. Drug gangs get their funding from middle-class recreational drug takers who think there is absolutely no connection between their recreational drug use at the weekend and a dead body found in a pool of blood with a gunshot wound to the head or a heroin baby born with an addiction problem. There is obviously a link. When one takes recreational drugs, then one is feeding that menace. I appreciate the support for the suggestion of consumption rooms. I know that people will have concerns around how they will manifest themselves and be operated. If one examines what happens in Sydney and the 88 such centres across Europe, it is an approach to the cohort of drugs users who are so desperate that they will inject heroin in an alleyway or the stairwell of a flats complex. Recently, I took a 45-minute walk around Dublin city centre with the Ana Liffey Drug Project, which advocates this new approach. We did not have to walk very far to see all the paraphernalia of drug taking, syringes and so forth.What gardaí, those working with drug addicts, the addicts themselves and even the retailers working in the city centre will say is that this is not good for anybody. It is not good for the image of the city and it certainly is not good for the individuals to have to reduce themselves to a position where they feel they have nowhere else to go for their medical need, for their addiction, than down a side alley to inject themselves. Should we not find some new approach to that small enough cohort of people who do not fit the criteria to go into a mainstream programme for treatment and, in this way, facilitate them to do what they do in a more dignified fashion as a step toward recovery? I think it is worthy of assessment and investigation, and it is something I am determined to do. This House has a good reputation for coming together collectively and on a cross-party basis to focus on issues such as direct provision and other issues of common intent. If this House was to come together collectively and on a cross-party basis and say this is something that should be investigated, this would stop it being a political football and we could take a practical approach to those most vulnerable of drug users who are most inclined to get involved in anti-social behaviour, burglary, muggings and all the rest of it because their need is so great. We have a fantastic opportunity at this time, as a collective, due to the redrafting of the national drugs strategy. There should be a shorter timeframe for the next strategy because seven years is too long and perhaps a five-year strategy would be better the next time. Given the Misuse of Drugs Act is being amended in the Dáil, this means we have a number of windows of opportunity through which we can force these issues. I would appreciate the opportunity to come back to this House to toss these issues around, as I have done on other issues. I have been asked whether I am too busy. I do not think anybody is too busy to deal with the drugs crisis and the drugs issues we have in this country. I do not think we can say the situation is worse or better; it is just different. The drugs issue changes drastically all the time. The age cohorts are different; we have lost a generation to heroin and the people are now older. The needs are different and the type of drug use is different, with polydrug use now common. The complication with alcohol is different and the type of drinking being done is different. If drugs are changing, we have to change our approach. The "just say no" approach will work for some people, including children, and we can frighten some children away from drug use completely. However, it does not work for everybody. We have to accept that and work on issues that may actually achieve something. The approaches in Portugal and in Sydney may be something we could look at but we have to get beyond the idea of calling people who have a medical need by a nickname, calling them junkies and assuming they are just human litter, and that as long as we push them away and do not see them, the problem is solved. I do not believe that. If we believe in a republic, and we all now believe in equality, the person who is injecting in the side alley in Dublin city centre, or in any town or part of this country, is as equal a citizen as any of the rest of us and deserves the dignity of having the State help him or her through what is obviously a medical need. I do not believe the criminal justice system is the best way to do this. I appreciate the comments made by Senators and I am happy to come back to the House at any time to flesh out these issues.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, to thank the Senator for raising this issue. The Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, is in the Dáil answering oral questions. I welcome the opportunity to address the role and clarify the position of the Department of Education and Skills in the complaints procedure process for secondary schools. The Senator will be aware that, under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed by the school board of management on behalf of the school's patrons or trustees or education and training board, ETB, known as the management authority. It is the management authority that employs the school's teachers and other staff members. In ETB schools, the ETB is the employer. The school principal manages the school on a day to day basis. Accordingly, whereas the Department of Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools neither the Minister nor the Department has legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension in accordance with section 29 of the 1998 Education Act. In dealing with parental complaints, the Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against the school can be progressed. Where parents feel that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.Section 28 is the section of the Education Act 1998 that provides for parental complaints in schools. It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school. The Minister for Education and Skills is not satisfied with the current provisions of section 28 and plans to revise it to provide in law for a parent and student charter. Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of the charter. Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important. If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision, they are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions.  A core objective of the charter is to shift away from reacting to problems only after they give arise to grievances. The emphasis will be on improving the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools in order that grievances will not arise or will be resolved quickly and informally. As a result, the need to resort to a formal grievance process should be much reduced. The Minister's intention is to amend section 28 of the Education Act 1998 to require every school to have a parent and student charter in accordance with principles set down in legislation that will set a national standard. Her plan is to have this change introduced during the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I share the Senator's concerns. While an incident such as a student being described as a sponge is rare, it would be outrageous if such a comparison were to be made that one student was a radiator, while another was a sponge. Most professionals never use that terminology, but, unfortunately, such instances can and sometimes do occur. As the Minister has stated formally in her reply which I have given to the House, it is her absolute intention to introduce a student and parent charter in legislation by amending section 28 of the Education Act 1998 by means of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I would be obliged if, in accordance with Standing Order 136, the Cathaoirleach directed the Clerk of the Seanad to make the following minor drafting corrections to the text of the Bill: on page 44, Part 1, Schedule 1, lines 10 to 44, inclusive, to correct the format of the citations used listing the enactments to be repealed by this Bill in order that they follow the appropriate convention, to move the closing bracket in each reference to encompass the entire citation of the Act. It is purely a correction of typographical errors and has no substantive effect.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the commemorations and what the State is doing. I appreciate the motivation behind the Bill. As Senator Darragh O'Brien has quite rightly stated, this is something on which we can have a cross-party discussion on how best to move forward. I know the issue intimately as I used to represent the north inner city area on Dublin City Council. One of the first meetings I attended when I was elected to the council in 2004 concerned the saving of No. 16 Moore Street. Much has happened since, thanks to the previous Government and recent announcements by this Government. No. 16 is the key building and most people focused on it, but the focus has moved to the declaration of the national monument by the previous Government in 2007 and the announcement of a decision made earlier this year to acquire the four buildings for the State. We have come a long way in a short space of time. This is a fantastic opportunity in the history of our Republic as we face the centenary of 1916 to reassess what we are about as a country. We should consider the values of this Republic and what we believe in. There are many people in our society who need this commemoration. I am thinking of the people on the edge of society. In this Chamber, for example, we have discussed direct provision, the national drugs strategy and those suffering from drug addiction and issues relating to disadvantage. We have discussed people from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual communities and new communities. There are many people, including children, living in the country who have no familial connection with what happened in 1916, as some would, but who need this commemoration. It will lead to a new evaluation of the values that underpin our Republic. Many of the commemorative events planned are focused on what we want for the next 100 years. We must have a proper investigation of what happened 100 years ago in order that people can appreciate the sacrifices made. We must never shy away from the reality that 1916 was the birth of the Republic in which we now live. It is also important that we constantly reimagine and reaffirm those values written into the Proclamation, including equal rights and opportunities for all our citizens, cherishing all the children of the nation equally. I have a family connection with 1916 but I do not consider myself in any way having more of a claim over those events than anyone else, and no one else is making that suggestion. We need to appreciate what happened in that week but we must ask why we are doing this. We are doing it to ensure we can have a proper appreciation of the values that must underpin the modern Republic in which we all live. In responding to the Bill I want to be as open-minded and positive as I can. I appreciate that the motivations behind it are sound, decent, progressive and forward-thinking. Much of this contribution must be quite technical but I hope it will add to the debate to give reasons that the Government is not in a position to accept the Bill. The primary aim of the Bill is to establish two new limited companies known as Moore Street Renewal Limited and Moore Street Properties Limited, respectively, to provide the grounds on which certain approvals can be made relating to existing or proposed buildings and premises in the Moore Street area and to have a development company for the Moore Street area. The development company will have functions for the compulsory acquisition of land in that area, and the Minister for Finance will have a power to guarantee borrowings by Moore Street Properties Limited. Unfortunately, while appreciating the constructive motivations behind the Bill, the Government does not support it for a variety of reasons which I will outline. First, I have to point out that the role of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is primarily concerned with the protection and conservation of the national monument comprising Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. The Minister has no role in planning and development in the wider Moore Street area, which is the preserve of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with the relevant local planning authority or other designated development authority. It could be foreseen as a conflict of roles where, on the one hand, the Minister is charged with safeguarding our built heritage, notably the national monument on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and, on the other hand, would be supporting development that could adversely impact the national monument and other historic buildings or fabric in the Moore Street area. Second, when it comes to urban development and regeneration my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, has primacy but his Department is already active with various initiatives that beneficially affect the Moore Street area and the proposed Bill would only serve to complicate rather than streamline the various measures in place. For example, in 2012, the Government published Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government. At its core, this programme seeks the local government system to be the primary vehicle for overall economic and community development at the local level, including the regeneration aspects of that brief. That action programme, more widely, sets out an overall vision for local government to be the principal vehicle of governance and public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably. Consistent with this overall vision, Government policy is to build on the local government process and not to establish separate or parallel public bodies or organisations distinct from the local government system unless, in exceptional circumstances, the need for this is clearly demonstrated. The proponents of the Bill may suggest this is an exceptional circumstance but that is why we are here having this discussion.  As previously outlined by Senator Eamonn Coghlan, with the dissolution of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the preparations in place to transit Temple Bar Cultural Trust to local authority control, which were established by previous Governments to pursue regeneration of large components of the overall structure of the Dublin City Council area, and at a strategic level, regeneration initiatives have moved on to a new phase that build on enhanced local authority capability in this area rather than setting up new bodies. Third, under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, Dublin City Council as both local government and planning consent authority is the most appropriate entity to manage the ongoing development of this important inner city area of Dublin. Already, sections of Moore Street and the auxiliary lanes are within the current O'Connell Street architectural conservation area, ACA, designated in July 2001, and the O'Connell Street area of special planning control adopted by Dublin City Council in September 2009. The main objectives of the Bill are unclear in terms of compliance with the current Dublin city development plan process and objectives for the inner city area of Dublin. In part, such a development approach as proposed in the Bill could be impractical given the variation of private, commercial and publicly owned properties within its remit, and the process involved in setting up the supporting statutory provisions could be difficult. Also, the size of the area in question and its variation of property types does not, on a practical level, lend itself to the type of development model envisaged. Management of a national monument is best developed, managed and promoted as specific proposals in tandem with Dublin City Council and other key stakeholders. The mechanisms I have outlined operate within the wider policy framework of the Dublin City Development Plan 2011-2017, which is currently under review. It remains open to the city council to prepare a statutory local area plan for the area under the provisions of the Planning Act, for which Dublin City Council would be the relevant authority to oversee implementation of such a plan. Therefore, an extensive array of planning policies and actions has been put in place for which the city council is the statutory implementation body. Moreover, after extensive levels of scrutiny at local authority and An Bord Pleanála levels, a planning permission for comprehensive redevelopment is in place, within which arrangements have recently been agreed as regards the securing of the 1916 Rising related national monument. Taking all of the above into account, the local government planning policy and development consent, and conservation policy and implementation issues pertaining to this area, have been broadly settled and it is therefore unclear what additional clarity or impetus could be brought to the accepted need for the regeneration of this area over and above the role of Dublin City Council. I have full confidence in Dublin City Council to manage the area using the policy already settled and the measures already in place. Fourth, I have already mentioned that Government policy is to build on the local government process and not to establish separate or parallel public bodies or organisations distinct from the local government system. However, there is a much wider dimension to this, and there is a context for it in terms of the previous Administration's tenure. That Government commissioned the officially named Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programme, An Bord Snip Nua, to examine, among other issues, the rationalisation of State agencies with a view to saving money in the delivery of services. Those same principles still apply today and it would be more than remiss of this Government were it to support a proposal to set up a new company with a board, a chief executive and staff which would represent an additional and costly layer of administration and which is at variance with current Government policy aimed at rationalising public services so as to deliver such services in an integrated, transparent and cost-efficient manner. While I appreciate the good intentions behind this Bill, and the contributions of all Members this evening have been worthy of the debate - we should continue in that way - I am of the opinion that the current approach taken by the Minister and the Government in acquiring the national monument on Moore Street, which was greatly applauded at the time, is the correct approach and should be commended. I am confident that this will protect the buildings for the Irish nation and its citizens. The buildings and the proposed interpretative centre on that site will be a fitting commemoration of the 1916 Rising and its leaders and will complement the new visitor centre being developed in the GPO. If we take a snapshot of that entire geographical area and consider the work ongoing on the interpretive centre at the GPO, the proposal for an interpretive centre in Moore Street, the tenement museum in Henrietta Street, the proposed development of the Abbey Theatre and the Parnell Square central library, that entire centre, and the connectivity between those sites, will lift the north inner city area. The north inner city area is worthy of that. It needs it. The city of Dublin needs it. Our nation needs it and, as I stated at the outset, future generations need it as well. While I appreciate the motivations behind the Bill, commend those who have drafted it and understand what they are trying to do, we do not believe that a new model is necessary. The proposal the Government has put in place in terms of acquiring the four buildings from Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street was a positive move. That is the vehicle in which we should proceed. A huge amount of work has taken place in the past ten years from the time of the original campaign to the designation of the national monument by the previous Government in 2007 to the acquisition of the four buildings.  I appreciate Senator O'Brien's point that we should not be doing this as a rushed measure to get something done for next Easter because it is hoped this will last for the next 100 years. However, we want to be able to say next Easter that something identifiable is taking place at this site and that we are moving to a space where we can have a proper understanding of the motivations behind those who fought in 1916 and the Republic in which we now live. I believe we have the mechanism now to achieve that. We are further along the way than we were this time last year. I believe the vehicle the Government has put in place is the appropriate one. Reluctantly, I am not willing to accept the Bill today but from the huge attendances at the consultation meetings taking place in communities around the country to the cross-party involvement in the various committees that have been set up around the commemorations, I believe this commemoration is owned by everybody in this land. It is not being used as a party political football, and that is to our credit in this House. I hope it will continue in that vein.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who apologises for not being here as he is at a Cabinet meeting. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and the funding of the national roads programme. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads are matters for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts,1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects are matters for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. The NRA is responsible for deciding on the annual allocations to individual road authorities.Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer. Given the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years. Funding in 2008 was €2.3 billion, while funding this year is approximately €730 million for the national, regional and local road network. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that could be undertaken. For that reason it is not possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects and the main focus must be on the maintenance and repair of roads together with a safety focused minor works programme. For now, only a small number of new national road projects are being progressed to construction stage. I understand the planned road improvement scheme for Slane was originally progressed as a single carriageway scheme; however, the feasibility study for the N2 route recommended a dual carriageway for the Slane bypass. The proposed scheme which was approximately 3.5 km in length and would pass to the east of Slane village was submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval. The grounds for the refusal of permission for the bypass in 2012 included the fact that An Bord Pleanála was not convinced that all possible traffic management alternatives had been fully explored. Statutory responsibility for traffic management rests with the local authority and following An Bord Pleanála's decision, Meath County Council, in liaison with the NRA, began evaluating traffic management options. The most recent Slane traffic management review
was undertaken by Halcrow Barry on behalf of the council and published in February this year. It is a matter for Meath County Council to liaise with the NRA in relation to how best to proceed at this point. The Roads Act 2015 provides for pre-planning consultation with An Bord Pleanála, and given An Bord Pleanála's previous decision to refuse permission it would seem to make sense for Meath County Council to initiate such discussions. There is no escaping the reality of limited resources and the indications are that funding will remain tight for the coming years. While the Minister has, he hopes, stabilised the funding position, the scope for any new improvement projects depends on the availability of additional capital funding in the future. Once the new capital plan is published the Minister will assess what can be done to address particular bottlenecks taking into account development consent requirements.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will relay those comments directly back to the Minister. I appreciate the Senator's contribution on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«As the Deputy will be aware, the role of the policing authority will be to oversee the performance by An Garda Síochána of its functions relating to policing services. An Garda Síochána is also the security service for the State and the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Government in respect of national security. This is, I understand, generally in line with a broad consensus within this House that security matters should not be within the remit of the authority. The Bill provides that, in the event of a disagreement between the authority and the Garda Commissioner, the Minister will decide whether a matter is a policing matter or a security matter. The Minister has considered the amendments carefully and she is of the view that, given that the security of the State is a priority function of the Government, the task of deciding whether an item relates to policing or security matters should be undertaken by the Minister for Justice and Equality in her or his capacity as a member of the Government. Overall, it is important to bear in mind that the Bill contains a definition of what constitutes security services in order that the scope of the authority's remit can be properly delineated. Under proposed section 44, the authority will, in performing its functions, have regard to the importance of the functions of An Garda Síochána concerning security services. In the circumstances, the Minister believes the scope for disagreements between the authority and the Garda Commissioner as to whether a particular item is a security matter or a policing matter will be quite limited. In addition, discussions to resolve any difficulty will undoubtedly take place between the authority and the Garda Commissioner before any issue is referred to the Minister. Moreover, the Minister has asked me to emphasise that, before making any decision as to whether a policing matter or security matter is involved, a Minister will be required to act impartially. As Senators will be aware, a number of important security related matters are already dealt with by the Minister, including authorising the interception of communications. I also understand the approach adopted in the Bill is in line with similar arrangements that have been made in Northern Ireland and Scotland regarding security matters. In the circumstances, the Minister considers that the measures for dealing with the relevant concerns in the Bill are appropriate. Accordingly, I ask the Senator not to press the amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The purpose of the amendments is to provide for the repeal of existing legislative provisions relating to An Garda Síochána that are now spent. This is a tidying-up exercise that has been undertaken in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh has already outlined the purpose and scope of his amendments and I do not propose to cover the same ground in detail. The effect of the amendments would be, in particular, to remove from the Government, the Minister for Justice and Equality in particular, any role in the appointment or dismissal of members of An Garda Síochána. Obviously, the main area of attention with regard to the Senator's amendments must be his proposals in respect of the most senior Garda ranks, and my response will focus primarily on those ranks. Before discussing the proposals on the appointment and dismissal of senior Garda personnel, however, it is crucial to bear in mind that there are a number of very significant contextual matters that must be fully taken into account. The first and most important of these matters is that, in this jurisdiction, all our legislation must be fully compatible with the Constitution. The last thing any Member of this House would wish is a serious constitutional question mark hanging over any legislation. In that connection, I draw the attention of Senators to Article 28.2 of the Constitution which specifically provides for the Executive power of the State to be exercised by or on the authority of the Government. In the course of the drafting of the Bill senior counsel provided legal advice for the Office of the Attorney General on the applicability of Article 28.2 with regard to legislative proposals which were being considered for inclusion in the Bill. This was a process in which written legal advices were supplied and in them senior counsel indicated clearly that, as a matter of custom, practice and proper constitutional interpretation, the function of An Garda Síochána in the exercise of the policing power of the State has been interpreted by the courts as a function that is exercised as part of the Executive power of the State. In that regard, while the senior counsel acknowledged that an Executive power of the Government under Article 28.2 could be delegated, he also stated it would not be constitutionally permissible for such a delegation to amount to an abdication of the Government's Executive power.Within this framework senior counsel specifically referred to the appointment and dismissal of the Garda Commissioner and his conclusion was that any legislative proposal related to the establishment of a policing authority should preserve, ultimately, the power of the Government to appoint or dismiss the Garda Commissioner. As Senators will appreciate, to address the relevant constitutional concerns, the advice of senior counsel is reflected in the provisions of the Bill. Given the importance of their functions, a similar approach has been adopted in the case of deputy commissioners.  When considering the Senators' amendments, it is also necessary to take account of the fact that An Garda Síochána is a security service for the State. Senators will be aware that under the Bill the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Government in respect of national security. This is an approach that has a wide measure of support within the Oireachtas. It goes without saying that national security is a key function of the Government. The Minister's view, leaving aside the very clear constitutional dimension involved, is that the appointment of the head of the national security service should be undertaken by a body other than the Government. To put the matter at its simplest, in view of the functions involved, the final appointing decision must rest with the Government. For similar reasons, the Minister is satisfied that the Government must continue to have the capacity to remove senior Garda members on security grounds. While there are other issues I might raise regarding the Senators' amendments, at this juncture I should concentrate on the functions being conferred on the policing authority by the Bill in the appointment and removal of Garda personnel. Under the Bill, the authority will have a leading role in determining a large body of Garda appointments. This will operate, in particular, at the very highest levels of the Garda organisation and the authority will also have general functions in Garda appointments and promotions. With regard to the Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner, all future appointments to these posts will be made solely on the basis of a nomination made by the policing authority, following a selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service. In exceptional circumstances, where the Government is unable for significant reasons to accept a nomination made by the authority, it will have to state its reasons. Where this occurs the Government will be obliged to ask the authority to nominate another person for the position. From an international perspective, it is very much the general practice that governments either make or must approve top level police appointments. For example, while the Chief Constable is appointed by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the appointment must be approved by the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice. Similar arrangements are in place in Scotland where a police authority has recently been established. In the case of Garda personnel, between the ranks of superintendent and assistant commissioner, the Bill provides that all appointments will be made directly by the policing authority. Additionally, the authority will appoint persons to positions within the Garda civilian staff which are equivalent to or above the rank of chief superintendent.  Regarding dismissals and in line with the constitutional and security principles I have outlined, the Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner will be removed by the Government. At the same time, the policing authority will have the power to recommend to the Government that a Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner be removed for policing reasons. While the Government will not be obliged to adopt such a recommendation, it is very difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would not do so. Dismissals of persons between the ranks of superintendent and assistant commissioner for policing reasons will be undertaken by the authority. It will also be able to suspend a person from duty in advance of a removal decision. While the Senators' amendments would go beyond the appointment and dismissal of Garda personnel, the Minister wishes to make it clear that the overall approach adopted to the Bill by the Government is that relevant functions should be transferred from the Government and the Minister to the policing authority where this is permissible and appropriate. However, the transfer process has its limitations and has to be undertaken against the general constitutional and policy backgrounds I have highlighted. Within these frameworks the Minister could not accept a situation, as proposed in the amendments, where the Minister for Justice and Equality, for substantial legal and policy reasons, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for budgetary reasons, would not be involved in determining the numbers of persons to be appointed to senior Garda ranks. Overall, the Minister appreciates that the approach of the Senators in the amendments is to remove what they perceive to be a system in which key elements could be the subject of political considerations. However, as I have indicated, the Minister believes the significant reforms and measures provided for in the Bill are fully adequate to address concerns they might reasonably have. In particular, substantial powers are being conferred on the new policing authority which will be independent in the exercise of its functions. Before I conclude on these amendments, I reiterate the earlier statement made by the Minister in the House that the proposals made in the Bill for the establishment of the independent policing authority will play a vital role in ensuring public confidence is maintained in An Garda Síochána and the essential services it provides. Moreover, as I have indicated, they have been developed to address very important constitutional and policy requirements that arise within both the policing and security areas. Unfortunately, for the reasons I have given, the amendments do not meet these requirements and as such the Minister is not in a position to accept them. Accordingly, I ask the Senators not to press them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Under the Bill, the policing authority will oversee the exercise of An Garda Síochána's policing functions. As I have outlined to the House under earlier amendments, the drafting of the Bill has proceeded in conjunction with ongoing legal advice provided by senior counsel to the Office of the Attorney General. This was done to ensure the functions of the authority would be fully consistent with the exercise by the Government of the executive power of the State under Article 28.2 of the Constitution. As I have indicated, in practical terms, there are constitutional limitations on the extent to which it is open to the Oireachtas, by way of legislation, to delegate the Government's ultimate power over policing to another body. A key element of the approach the Government has been advised and legally compelled to adopt is to avoid any suggestion the ultimate capacity of the Government to intervene in the policing sphere might be unconstitutionally restricted. The three areas covered by the Senator's amendments are the setting of priorities for policing within the State, the approval of the three-yearly strategy statement for the Garda organisation and the adoption of the annual Garda policing plan.For the purpose of addressing the amendments, I do not propose to enter into a detailed discussion of what is involved in each of these areas. However, it is clear, on any analysis, that we are talking about a set of very significant functions. The setting of priorities for An Garda Síochána is a matter of the highest importance in determining how gardaí operate in carrying out their functions throughout the country. These priorities, in turn, feed into Garda strategy statements and annual policing plans which play a vital role in directing gardaí. Furthermore, they are pivotal in terms of the allocation of financial and other resources throughout the Garda organisation. In view of the importance of the functions involved and on the basis of legal advice provided by senior counsel, the Minister is satisfied that it would not be appropriate for final decisions to be taken by the policing authority in the matters covered by the Senator's amendments. For that reason, the Bill provides that the areas in question will be subject to a co-decision procedure with the authority, which will involve approval being given by the Minister. In the circumstances, the Minister considers the approach adopted in the Bill to be the correct one. Moreover, it is my understanding that similar arrangements apply in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland and Scotland. Accordingly, the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I cannot comment on why the GRA did not speak before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The current arrangements for the issuing of directives to the Garda Commissioner by the Minister are to be found in section 25 of the principal Act. In particular, Government approval is required before any directive can be issued. Where a directive is issued, it must, except in certain cases relating to sensitive matters, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 23 of the Bill amends the current provision in the principal Act to enable the policing authority to recommend to the Minister that a directive on a specific matter relating to policing services be issued to the Garda Commissioner. This provision recognises there may be circumstances in which the authority considers Government or ministerial intervention is appropriate in a particular instance. As I outlined to the House on other amendments proposed by the Senator, there are constitutional limitations on the extent to which it is open to the Oireachtas, by way of legislation, to delegate the Government's ultimate control over policing to another body. Having considered the relevant legal advice provided by senior counsel on the application of Article 28.2 of the Constitution, the Minister believes there would be constitutional difficulties in seeking to enable the authority solely to direct the Garda Commissioner on policing matters. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to give the authority capacity to issue a directive "concerning any matter relating to the Garda Síochána" without prior Government approval. Under the amendment, the authority would be in a position to issue a directive to the Garda Commissioner on a security matter, for instance, even though such matter would not fall within the remit of its functions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Section 38 of the principal Act makes provision for the Garda Commissioner to authorise the installation and operation of closed circuit television schemes in public places for the sole or primary purpose of securing public order and safety in public places, by facilitating the deterrence, prevention, detection and prosecution of offences. In the development of the principal Act, section 38 was given particular consideration in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. In the course of advice provided by that office, it was indicated that the operation of CCTV schemes under the principal Act would fall directly within the executive function of the State within Article 28.2 of the Constitution. Accordingly, for the constitutional reasons I have explained in connection with previous amendments, specific roles were provided by the Government and the Minister in section 38. In part, these roles were intended to ensure that CCTV schemes would operate with due respect and safeguards for the constitutional right to privacy. Section 31 enables the authority to perform the functions currently exercised by the Minister relating to community CCTV schemes. In particular, the authority will, by order made with the approval of the Government, establish applicable criteria for the purposes of community CCTV schemes. Moreover, it may, with the consent of the Minister, issue guidelines to the Garda Commissioner relating to the supervision and control by the Commissioner of the monitoring of CCTV by authorised persons. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to remove any role for the Government and the Minister under the section. Acceptance of the amendments, therefore, would prevent the Government and the Minister from exercising their constitutional functions. In all the circumstances, the Minister is satisfied that the provisions enable the authority to exercise an appropriate level of oversight in respect of CCTV schemes while not impinging on the constitutional functions of the Minister and the Government. In the circumstances, it is regretted that the amendments cannot be accepted and I call on the Senator to withdraw them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The wording sought to be deleted by the amendment is concerned with the terms and conditions of the members of the Garda audit committee. They are standard provisions found in many statutes. The fixing of such terms and conditions is an administrative rather than a core oversight function. It is the standard practice that the terms and conditions of State appointees such as the members of an audit committee would be agreed with the relevant Minister and the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform. In the circumstances, the Minister is calling on the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A key aim of the Government in establishing the authority is to provide a system of oversight of An Garda Síochána that is effective and fully independent. In this context, the Government is of the clear view that the membership of the authority should not include serving politicians, and the Bill provides that they will be ineligible to be members. I recognise that the Senator's amendments are related to a further proposed amendment that will not be discussed. However, the Minister would have serious concerns with any proposal to remove the ineligibility provisions which prevent politicians from serving on the authority. As I have indicated, this would run counter to the firm policy of the Government. The approach of the Government to this matter is to remove the operation of the authority from the political arena. At the same time it is important to bear in mind that it will be open to committees of the Oireachtas to raise relevant matters directly with members of the authority. I understand the Senator's overall approach is based to some extent on the system applicable to the Northern Ireland Policing Board which has 19 members, comprising ten political members and nine independent members appointed by the Minister with responsibility for justice. However, the Minister believes the composition of the Northern Ireland Policing Board must be viewed in the context of the specific requirements in the North for cross-party and cross-community support for the policing arrangements in that jurisdiction. It is relevant to note that in its report published in October 2014 the joint Oireachtas committee recommended that the Scottish model would be appropriate for our jurisdiction. The legislation for the Scottish authority specifically prohibits serving politicians from membership. In the circumstances, the Minister is inviting the Senator to withdraw the amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am aware that the general scheme of the Bill provided that the authority would monitor and address human rights compliance by An Garda Síochána in policing matters. However, this element was subsequently removed from the Bill prior to publication so as to avoid duplication of the functions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. Senators will be aware that the IHREC is the primary State body which oversees and monitors Garda human rights and equality compliance. It is also important to make it clear that the authority will, in accordance with its general supervisory powers, have the ability to pursue human rights policing matters directly with An Garda Síochána. This could be done in different ways and, for example, such issues could be raised in the public meetings it will hold with the Garda Commissioner. In addition, under a new section which is being inserted by section 44 of the Bill, the authority will be in a position to liaise closely with the IHREC. Within this framework the Minister has no doubt that there will be close co-operation between the two bodies and that they will work together very effectively. I might also mention that human rights is a key organisational priority for An Garda Síochána. For example, section 16 of the 2005 Act provides a revised form of declaration for persons joining the force which specifically directs each new member to have regard for human rights in carrying out their policing duties; a Garda declaration of professional values and ethical standards, which underpins all Garda practice, policy and procedure, has been published and distributed to each member; all operational Garda directives make reference to the human rights principles applicable to the relevant instruction so as to remind all members of their human rights obligations; the new trainee programme for Garda recruits - BA in applied policing programme - and ongoing professional development measures for members incorporates specific human rights training; and the Garda Commissioner receives advice from the strategic human rights
advisory committee
on the ongoing development of human rights policies within An Garda Síochána. As well as policing expertise, the committee includes representatives from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. In the circumstances, the Minister considers that fully adequate provision has been made in order to ensure human rights compliance by and within An Garda Síochána. I ask the Senator to not to press the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The effect of this amendment would be to remove the requirement for the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform where the authority is seeking to enter into contracts with persons or appoint consultants. The requirement for ministerial consent is a standard requirement in such circumstances and it is an important aspect of good governance. As the relevant arrangements that have been made in the Bill are in line with the established procedures for State bodies, the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendment. In the circumstances, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The purpose of these amendments is to make provision for a chief executive designate of the authority and they have been introduced in consultation with the chairperson designate. They are also in line with the statutory procedures that have been adopted for other State agencies. Senators will be aware that I am making arrangements for the authority to operate in shadow format pending the enactment and commencement of the legislation. This is a process that is specifically provided for in the Bill. Arrangements are being made with the Public Appointments Service for the selection of the ordinary members designate. It is also proposed that the chief executive will be in place as quickly as possible following a selection process to be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service. It is important that in the event that the selection of the chief executive by the Public Appointments Service is completed before the commencement of the legislation, the person selected will be in a position to operate as a chief executive designate. This will significantly facilitate the preparations for the establishment of the authority. The authority will formally appoint a chief executive designate as the chief executive, following the establishment day. Amendments Nos 75 and 76 make this possible. Amendments Nos. 77 to 84 are technical and consequential on amendments 75 and 76. They operate to re-number subsections (2) to (9).
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senators will recall that among the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Act 2015 was a provision inserting a new section 102B into the principal Act which brought the Garda Commissioner within the scope of GSOC investigations for the first time. This was a significant development and one to which the Government attaches a high degree of importance. The issue of Ministerial consent to GSOC carrying out an investigation into the conduct of the Garda Commissioner was debated during the passage of the 2015 Act through the Houses. Under the provisions of the Act the consent of the Minister is required before a complaint against the Commissioner is investigated by GSOC. In this regard, it must be borne in mind that in addition to carrying out her general policing functions, the Garda Commissioner is the head of the national security service. In the latter role the Commissioner fulfils a vital role which is very closely linked to the obligations of the Government to preserve the security of the State. After careful consideration the Government was satisfied that taking account of the key position of the Commissioner in security matters, the Minister should consent to any proposed investigation by GSOC into any concerns that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct.However, the Minister would emphasise that, as proposed in the Bill, the requirement for ministerial consent does not simply permit the Minister to refuse to give consent - there must be reasons for doing so. This is spelled out in proposed subsection (3)(a) which states the Minister must provide reasons to the authority where he or she refuses to consent to the authority making a request to GSOC. In these circumstances, there is no doubt that it would only be in exceptional cases that the Minister would not consent to a proposed investigation. Accordingly, the Minister considers that it is almost impossible to envisage any circumstances under which, on foot of a demonstrable concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct, ministerial consent would be withheld. While the Minister appreciates the concerns that have prompted the Senator's proposed amendment, she does not believe they are necessary for the reasons I have indicated. In the circumstances, the Minister asks the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank the Senator for raising this matter. As he is aware, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, was established on a statutory basis in 2012, in accordance with the provisions of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011. The authority is independent in the performance of its functions. A key role of the authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by property service providers who fall into four categories - auctioneers of all types, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents. The 2011 Act provides for the licensing of all companies and individuals engaged in the provision of property services. There are in excess of 4,000 companies and individuals licensed to provide property services. A publicly visible register of these licensees is maintained on the PSRA website at www.psra.ie. Under section 28 of the Act, it is an offence to provide a property service, or purport to be available to provide a property service, unless the person is appropriately licensed. A company or person who contravenes this section of the Act is liable to a fine or imprisonment, or both. It is the authority's policy to prosecute all of those found to be trading without a licence. A number of prosecutions have already been before the courts in the Dublin area. The Minister for Justice and Equality has been informed that two cases have so far resulted in convictions and more cases are pending. She has been advised by the authority that 242 instances of companies or individuals suspected to be trading without a licence have been brought to its attention since 2012. Some 23% of these cases involved companies of individuals who were, in fact, already licensed. A letter campaign instructing companies to cease trading without licences resulted in a further 6% applying for and being granted licences. Another 31% have ceased trading or were never trading in the first place and no current evidence can be found of trading. The authority is investigating the remainder of the cases.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am very pleased to be here on the resumption of Committee Stage of this important Bill.

Senators will be well aware of my strong opinions on the need to amend the current section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and that, together with Senators Ivana Bacik and Mary Moran, as well as Deputies John Lyons, Dominic Hannigan and Ciara Conway, I first introduced this Bill to the Houses in 2013. I also acknowledge the work done by Senator Averil Power on her previous Bill on the issue and a similar Bill two weeks ago from Deputies Catherine Murphy, Ruth Coppinger and Joe Higgins. The existing section 37(1) of Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that where a religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person if it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or prospective employee where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or it takes action that is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. The provision was previously contained in the Employment Equality Bill 1996, which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held that Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance that better meets the needs of employees, the logic of the Supreme Court decision is that a balance does need to be struck; it is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. For this reason, the Government, in the programme for Government, committed to amending section 37(1) to ensure its operation leads to a fairer and more equitable balance between the rights of freedom of religion or association, on the one hand, and, on the other, the right of persons in employment, or prospective employees, to be free from discrimination and to privacy in their personal lives. A key feature of the Bill is the distinction it makes between religious institutions that are entirely privately funded and those which are funded by the taxpayer. The rationale is that in the case of the second category, the Government has the right - and arguably the duty - to protect employees who are paid from the public purse from unfair treatment or discrimination. On examination by the Attorney General's office, the Bill was found to be essentially constitutionally sound, although some amendments are required to the text as published to enhance its constitutional robustness. Aside from some technical changes, the most significant change that needs to be made - the precise details of which I will bring before the House on Report Stage - is to replace a proposed power for the Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills, to issue directions or guidelines to relevant employers for the purpose of giving effect to the proposed amended provision. It was felt that this approach would be unsafe, as the courts could find it to be an unlawful delegation of authority by the Oireachtas. Instead, the Government amendments will oblige relevant employers in religious-run schools and hospitals to show that favourable treatment of an employee or prospective employee is limited to the religion ground and that action taken against a person is objectively justified by reference to that institution's aim of protecting its religious ethos and that the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.  The proposed new subsection will provide that action taken against an employee or prospective employee on the religion ground shall not be regarded as justified unless it is rationally and strictly related to the institution's religious ethos; a response to conduct by a person which undermines or would undermine the religious ethos of the institution, rather than a response to that person's status under any of the other discrimination grounds, such as sexual orientation, that are set out in equality legislation; and proportionate to the conduct of the employee or prospective employee, having regard to alternative action the employer could take, the consequences of any action taken for the employee or prospective employee and the actual damage caused to the religious ethos of the institution.The aim is to raise the bar in order that religious run schools and hospitals will have to show real damage to their ethos, are precluded from discrimination on any of the other equality grounds and that any action taken is reasonable and proportionate. I wish to signal my intention to the House to use the opportunity afforded by the Bill to advance on Report Stage a number of other, mainly technical, amendments to existing equality legislation. On rent supplement and housing assistance payment, the most significant amendment is to prohibit discrimination in the letting of residential accommodation on the basis that a person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement or housing assistance payment. It will eliminate the inclusion, by some landlords, of references to rent supplements not being accepted in advertisements for residential rented property. This will involve an amendment to sections 2 and 6 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  I also intend to amend the definitions of indirect discrimination in the Equality Acts to follow precisely the definitions in the relevant EU directives and their evolving interpretation by the European Court of Justice. Therefore, amendments will be advanced to the definitions of indirect discrimination in the Employment Equality Act 1998, Equal Status Act 2000 and the Pensions Act 1990 to bring the letter of the legislation into line with those directives. While the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discriminatory advertisements, there is no provision to allow an aggrieved party in relation to an employment opportunity to take a case to the Equality Tribunal other than a referral by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, formerly the Equality Authority. I intend to remedy this deficiency by allowing the person, himself or herself to take a complaint, as distinct from allowing cases to be taken solely by the IHREC. This will involve amendments to sections 2, 8(5), 12 and 13 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. While the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004 based on the wording in the directive, the case law of the European Court of Justice has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific provisions of the directive. The court has also held that the provision of fixed-term contracts on the basis of age constitutes age discrimination and would require justification under Article 6 of the directive. I, therefore, intend to bring forward amendments to bring our domestic legislation more into line with these judgments. The amendments required are to sections 6 and 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The State is obliged under the European Economic Area agreement and the EU-Swiss agreements to ensure that benefits in admission to any course of vocational training offered by an educational or training body are extended to EU nationals and are also extended to EEA and Swiss nationals, in the absence of an explicit provision to the contrary in these agreements. In practice, the same benefits in terms of such fees and admission are afforded to EEA and Swiss nationals, but the equality legislation does not refer to Swiss and EEA nationals and needs to be amended to explicitly reference them. I will bring forward the necessary amendments on Report Stage. Amendments required here are to section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and to section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000. As these amendments will extend the scope of the Bill, it will be necessary to amend on Report Stage the Bill's Long and Short Titles along with the collective citations. I look forward to engaging further with Senators on Report Stage and ensuring an effective Bill is passed by both Houses and enacted as quickly as possible.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is my intention and the individual discussions can then take place on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He reminds me of a good friend of mine, a committed Dublin supporter, who once had to do teaching practice in County Meath and had to convince all the children of the merits of supporting the Meath football team, which really went against his ethics. Not to belittle the point that has been made, the difficulty we have here is a procedural one because it has been two years since we had this conversation in this House. There are various reasons for that, but we are here now.  We cannot accept the amendment on Committee stage. It makes much more sense to do so on Report Stage when the Government amendments are published. The proper context can then be given and a proper discussion can then be had as to reasons various amendments can, should or may not be accepted. I appreciate the Senator's position. We are on amendment No. 4, but we are having a broader debate now on the substance of the entirety of the Bill. I think it would be more appropriate do this on Report Stage, but I appreciate what everybody here is saying. We have gone off into whole new area with what Senator David Norris said, which will probably capture most of the headlines, but we need to focus back on the procedural element, which is what we are doing on Committee Stage. Report Stage will be taken next week. I accept there is a problem with the procedural elements in the House of having such a long delay between the last discussion two years ago and the discussion we are having now.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Procedurally, again, my response is the same as to all these amendments. Report Stage would be a better context in which to debate them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are trying to achieve this together. In the Dáil three weeks ago, a Bill was tabled by three Deputies from the Anti-Austerity Alliance and the Government did not oppose the Bill because it accepted its spirit, despite the fact that a Bill was already working its way through the process. I hope Senators will accept my bona fides. We are trying to ensure we have full context to what we are doing and we understand that Senators need Government amendments to work on in order that we can have a proper debate on Report Stage. That will be done.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Again, in the absence of Government amendments, the same point is being made and I will repeat my remarks. The Government amendments will oblige relevant employers in religious-run schools and hospitals to show that favourable treatment of an employee, or prospective employee, is limited to the religion ground. The religion ground shall not be regarded as justified unless it is the following circumstances - rationally and strictly related to the institution's religious ethos; a response to the conduct of a person, which was the point made by Senator Averil Power, which undermines or would undermine the religious ethos of the institution, rather than being a response to that person's status under any of the other discrimination grounds such as sexual orientation, marital status or being an unmarried parent or divorcee, as set out in equality legislation; and is proportionate, which is a key word, to the conduct of the employee, or prospective employee, having regard to alternative action the employer could take, etc. In terms of the amendment, the Government will also table amendments to the Bill. Today, we are discussing the text of my remarks. Rather than get into the substance of the debate I understand where the Senator is coming from. It would be better for the debate, in its totality, to take place on Report Stage when we have the context of the Government amendments, rather than working from the initial Bill and my own remarks.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate what has been said. However, most European countries have a section 37(1) or their own version of section 37(1). The difficulty in Ireland is that the vast majority of schools, particularly national schools, are under religious patronage whereas in other European countries that is not the case. In every other European country that I am aware of, a version of section 37(1) is on their statute books. In those countries the State's education system runs in a particular way but parallel to that are religious ethos schools and teachers make their own determinations. The difficulty in this country is that we do not, effectively, have a State-run education system. We have a State-funded education system which is then outsourced to patron bodies and that is how we run the system here. We have a section 37(1) on our Statute Book which has a huge impact on virtually every primary schoolteacher unless he or she is fortunate enough or has the facility to teach in a school that does not impinge on his or her ethos. The difficulty is the population of schools, or the number of schools, which are run under a religious ethos and trying to balance the constitutional right of parents to have education delivered through a particular religious ethos with the right of the worker. In other countries the balance is easier struck but here it is not as easy to do, unfortunately. That is the balance that we are trying to strike.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The essence of the amendments is to provide a clear definition of what "conduct" means. My nervousness is that because it took so long to get it to this stage, if we start giving specific examples of the meaning of "conduct", it could take a lot longer before the Bill is enacted. I take on board what the Senator said that perhaps we need to do some work on language and perhaps we can do something when the Bill goes to the other House. In the absence of any case law, it is very difficult to know what would or would not happen in that eventuality. Speaking personally, the only issue that was raised about my prospective employment was membership of a particular political party and I had to deal with that.  I have sympathy for the Senator's position. However, other legislation protects the freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. We hope to get a clearer definition of the meaning of "conduct". Assuming a particular course of action would not lead to any kind of ramifications in a person's employment is not good enough and tighter language or explanation is required. We can work on that issue, but I am slightly nervous that if there are too many scenarios, this Bill would end up back in the Attorney General's office and we might not see it again in the lifetime of the Government. While I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do and we can work on that issue, there is the question of how successful it would be.  If a private citizen goes on a march in support of something he or she feels strongly about, and this is technically not in line with a particular religious view of the world, it is a question whether this will impact on his or her employment prospects. For example, if a promotion opportunity arises in a school or a hospital, will the person be overlooked because he or she is demonstrably in favour of a political viewpoint? Let us work on it. I am conscious that we have spent a long time on this Bill and I am anxious to get it through. We have made substantial amendments to the original text. That will have been obvious in the discussions yesterday and the amendments have been roundly welcomed. We can have a more comprehensive debate on Report Stage. We are trying to nail down the definition of the word "conduct" and this will be the key element. It is all about raising the bar to make it so high that it would really have to be a very unusual or a deliberate event to contradict the ethos of the institution concerned. Bill reported without amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I hope my visit to the House this afternoon will be more productive than my visit here this morning. Before addressing the content of amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendment No. 19, I hope I may be allowed to make one or two brief introductory remarks. We had an unusual Committee Stage and an unusual journey to get to Report Stage. I appreciate that the rules under which we operate on Report Stage may restrict Senators in the contributions they can make. I want to make it clear that I am more than happy to co-operate with Members in terms of recommitting groups of sections, as has been advised to us as the appropriate procedure, to ensure we can have a full discussion on each and every aspect of the Bill and the amendments I am recommending be made to it. Given the additions I am proposing to the Bill, the Long Title has been amended to reflect these changes, including references to the relevant EU directives, the Pensions Acts 1990 to 2014, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2012, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011 and to matters related thereto. The references to the EU directives will be helpful to my Department in its discussions with the European Commission in relation to our transposition obligations - the point being that part of what we are proposing to do is to make technical changes to the existing equality legislation to reflect in specific areas the evolving jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, our own courts and the Equality Tribunal in equality law cases. That is the context for amendment No. 1. A Chathaoirligh, will I proceed to deal with amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 19?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendment No. 2 introduces a definition of the "Act of 2000" as we need to refer to the Equal Status Act 2000. Amendment No. 3 deletes the definition of "Minister" as we do not need this as we are amending existing legislation that already has this definition. In amendment No. 19 we are making consequential changes to the Short Title, collective citation and the commencement provisions. The Title of the Bill will change so that once enacted it will be known as the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015. This change is needed as we propose to amend both the employment equality and the equal status streams of equality legislation and to amend relative provisions in the Pensions Acts.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The principal equality directives have essentially the same definition of indirect discrimination. I will quote from the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which contains the following definition: "indirect discrimination should be taken to occur when an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons having a particular religion or belief, a particular disability, a particular age, or a particular sexual orientation at a particular disadvantage ...".There is more in the text of the directive but that quote captures the key point, and I will quote from this one directive only in the interests of brevity.  The wording of the directives was not followed when the directives were transposed into Irish Law. The words "would put" was replaced with the word "puts", as follows, for example, in section 19(4) of the Employment Equality Act: "Indirect discrimination occurs where an apparently neutral provision puts persons of a particular gender (being As or Bs) at a particular gender at a particular disadvantage in respect of remuneration compared with other employees of their employer." The reason for this is that there was a view at the time the Acts were drafted that the term "would put" could lead to persons taking cases where they did not have locus standi or were not members of the particular ground under which they were claiming discrimination. Therefore, the word "puts" replaces the words "would put".The case law is now clear: to claim indirect discrimination, a person must assert membership of a particular class of persons to whom the Acts apply and must demonstrate actual personal detriment. Speculative or theoretical claims are not permissible. It is proposed, therefore, that the definitions of indirect discrimination in Irish equality legislation be amended to follow precisely the EU definitions. Amendments are required to the Employment Equality Acts, the Equality Status Acts and the Pensions Acts, as is evident from the text of amendment No. 4. Essentially, we are replacing the indicative with the subjunctive. We are bringing our legislation into line with the actual language used in the EU directives but not making any change to the actual law as it is applied in practice. In addition, arising from amendments Nos. 4, 10 and 11, this issue comes up in respect of amendment No. 7. However, as the main issue in that amendment relates to advertising, we will discuss it with the next group of amendments but without my repeating this element of the explanation. The nature of the Equality Acts is such that technical adjustments are required in individual sections that relate to more than one of the substantive amendments I am recommending. I hope, therefore, that Members will bear with me.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The group of amendments includes amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 9, but, due to the structure of the Equality Acts, part of amendment No. 8 is also relevant. However, as that amendment mainly deals with a different issue related to the position of Swiss and EEA nationals, it has been grouped with amendment No. 18 with which it will be discussed. We are considering a group of amendments that relate to advertising. Section 10 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discriminatory advertisements. Section 85(1)(d) allows the Equality Authority, now the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, to refer a publication or display to which section 10 applies to the director of the Equality Tribunal, soon to be the Workplace Relations Commission, for adjudication and decision. However, there is no provision to allow an individual who considers that he or she has been discriminated against in an employment opportunity to take a case. The Equality Tribunal brought this issue to my Department’s attention, with a request that the current provision be amended so as to allow an aggrieved individual to submit a complaint. The tribunal pointed to a case in which the Court of Justice of the European Union stated: “The fact that an employer states publicly that it will not recruit employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin constitutes direct discrimination in respect of recruitment within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, such statements being likely strongly to dissuade certain candidates from submitting their candidature and, accordingly, to hinder their access to the labour market.” The judgment refers to the race directive and access to the labour market. Therefore, the changes to the legislation being proposed include access to vocational training and membership of certain bodies, in addition to access to recruitment and promotion. To ensure the amendments proposed do not allow for what might be termed an “officious bystander” to take a case, that is, where that person may not be a potential candidate for the particular vacancy or membership that may be involved, the approach taken in the drafting of the amendments is to amend sections 8, 12 and 13 of the Act to ensure there is a real connection between the person claiming discrimination and the advertiser.  The definition of the word "advertisement" in section 2 of the Employment Equality Act is being expanded to include a public statement as per the judgement of the European Court of Justice. We are not proposing a similar amendment on the equal status side and this question needs further consideration as the court judgment does not refer to the relevant directive. This is a question that is being examined further in consultation with the Equality Tribunal and, if deemed appropriate and necessary, can be addressed in future legislation, but I do not anticipate that we will have completed this examination in time for our consideration of this Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«When the framework employment directive, Directive No. 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004, reliance was placed on the wording of recital 14 of the directive which states: "This Directive shall be without prejudice to national provisions laying down retirement ages". The conclusion is that it was not necessary to amend section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. Section 34(4) states: "Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees...". However, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific terms of the directive, in particular Article 6.1. Article 6.1, entitled, Justification of differences of treatment on grounds of age, provides that: "Member States may provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary". The Court of Justice of the European Union has in the course of a series of judgments applied this test to national compulsory retirement schemes. The High Court, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal have applied this test in Irish cases. As a result, the text of section 34(4) which seems to give carte blanche to employers to set any age as a retirement age does not reflect the law as it is actually applied. It is, therefore, proposed that it be amended to reflect the law as it actually is, that is, as developed in the jurisprudence. Similarly, section 6(3)(c) of the EEA also requires amendment. Section 6(3)(c) provides: "(c) Offering a fixed term contract to a person over the compulsory retirement age for that employment or to a particular class or description of employees in that employment shall not be taken as constituting discrimination on the age ground". The Court of Justice of the European Union in its case law has also held that the provision of fixed-term contracts on the basis of age constitutes age discrimination and would require justification under Article 6 of the directive.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am informed that we do not have a national framework in this area. Effectively, there is no discrimination on the basis of age if the offering of the fixed-term contract reflects the practice or the nature of the business over a period of time. It is unusual for a termination to take place in the context of this legislation, but we are effectively transposing requirements from EU directives into national legislation, thus tidying up many things that need to be tidied up. While the thrust of the Bill was actually to deal with employment equality legislation, we are using this vehicle to transpose others in the Bill before the House. I understand from where the Senator is coming. Effectively, the amendment employs legalistic terminology on what is known to be the case already.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The provision brings the Bill in line with the law as it stands. There is effectively no change other than streamlining existing legislation to ensure clarity.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Section 12(7) of the Employment Equality Act and section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 provide different fees, grants and admission arrangements for vocational training and access to education may apply between Irish and EU citizens on one hand, and citizens of other states on the other. The State is obliged under EEA agreements and EU-Switzerland agreements to ensure the benefits extended to EU nationals are also extended to EEA and Swiss nationals in the absence of explicit provision to the contrary in the agreements. In practice, the same benefits are extended to such individuals but the Acts do not reference them explicitly. These amendments are required to provide for an explicit reference.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am going to miss section 37 when it has been enacted. It has been a part of my life for the last three years. This was a long and tortuous process and many of us worked hard on a cross-party basis to bring the Bill to this stage. We are now at the heart of the Bill. I am conscious that it has not been possible to have a real debate on the text and options previously because the Government has not been in a position until now to bring forward its proposed amendments to the Private Members' Bill. To fill that gap and to outline the rationale for our proposed approach, I propose to rehearse the history of the Bill. While some Senators will be familiar with the history, it is important that the details be accessible in the Official Report. The Private Members' Bill as published has been examined carefully by my Department and the Attorney General. It may appear that we are deleting and replacing all of the existing text but we are not. There are technical and drafting reasons for the approach being taken to amending the Bill but our conclusion on foot of a lengthy examination is that the Bill as published is largely constitutionally sound. There is a specific concern that the proposed new section 37(1)(c) in section 2 of the Bill as published, which would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills, to issue direction or guidelines, could constitute an unlawful delegation by the Oireachtas of its legislative responsibilities. Instead of this provision we propose to provide for a list of considerations to be taken into account by employers, as set out in the proposed new subsection (1)(c).The objective is to ensure the bar is set sufficiently high that employers must provide objective justification for any action taken against an employee and must show that the action is related to, and proportionate to, the actual damage to the ethos of the institution and is rationally and strictly related to the employer's religious ethos. The reversal of the burden of proof in the following paragraph (d) is not necessary as section 85A of the Act contains this provision already. On the substance of the Private Members' Bill and the specific amendment, it is critically important we get this right. The existing section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that:A religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of this Part or Part II if--(a) it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee over that person where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or(b) it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.The provision was previously contained in the Equality Bill 1996 which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held the Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance, the better to meet the rights of employees, the Supreme Court's decision outlines the need for a balance to be struck. It is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. We must recognise the right of the religious institutions concerned to prevent the undermining of their ethos and for that reason, I am not able to accept amendment No. 14. It would render the remainder of the amendments apropos section 37 meaningless as they would not link back to paragraph (b). There are going to be disputes and, aside from intervening to an extent that does not potentially raise constitutional concerns, it is unclear how deleting section 37(1)(b) will provide any guidance on how to resolve disputes between employees and employers. It would remain the case that an employer had the right to take action against employees who acted against the employer's best interests and disputes would, following deletion of the existing provision, fall to be resolved in the generally applicable labour relations law. I hope the Senator will accept my rationale. While the provision that is now section 37(1) was found in 1997 to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of employees, on the one hand, and freedom of religion, on the other, there is legitimate concern that, in practice, it has not worked. Primarily its operation is regarded as having a particularly chilling effect on LGBT people in the education system. However, it also affects lone parents and divorcees who are restricted in discussing their private lives with their colleagues in the safety of their staff room. I have more to say on the specific amendments proposed to amendment No. 13, but I will stop there.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Zappone seeks to delete a significant section from the Act. I wish we could do so. I also wish we were not dealing with the existing education system and Constitution or the reality in which we find ourselves. Yesterday, when I met many of the groups represented in the Gallery, I made the point that the education system perpetuates inequality by its very constitution. Since its establishment, the State has abdicated responsibility for education by outsourcing the education system. It was decided to have a State-funded education system, rather than a State education system. Schools were established and the State placed them out for tender and asked patron bodies to oversee the running of them. I do not like this but it is the reality within which we must operate. Unfortunately, whatever manner or means we employ to regulate this area, it will never be perfect and education will never be as equal as we would like it to be. I meet many deputations who raise the issue of equality in the education system. For example, parents ask why they must baptise children to send them to a local school. I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of having a number of denominational schools in a given area, with children going into school through different school gates. We consistently separate children on the basis of religion and gender. Moreover, because the education system is fundamentally based on the idea of competition, it is inevitable that children who are more disadvantaged lose out and those who are more advantaged gain.  I fully agree with the approach proposed by Senator Zappone because the current position is unjust. While the Bill focuses primarily on employees, what is the child of a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, LGBT, couple, a divorcee or a single parent expected to feel in this scenario? I am keenly aware of this issue but what does one do when one is charged with responsibility of legislating within constitutional confines? That is the position in which this Government finds itself and any other Government would find itself. I would love to delete the section, as proposed in the amendment, but I predict that if we were to do so, we would be on the losing side in a case before the High Court or Supreme Court. It is inevitable that a court case will be taken in response to this legislation because that is what people tend to do in these circumstances. This will mean we will be back working off the original section 37, rather than the amended section we are trying to introduce today.  Senator Bacik stated that the mechanism we are trying to insert in the Act would make it almost impossible for any employer to suggest that anyone, on the basis of his or her nature, is undermining anything. By continuing to allow more than 90% of the infrastructure of primary level schools to remain in a religious ethos, we will perpetuate inequality. That is a fundamental reality of the position in which we find ourselves and that position is backed up by the Constitution.  People tell me how wonderful the education system is in Finland and what wonderful literacy statistics it produces. In Finland, there is one school in each school district, which means there are no primary, secondary, boys' or girls' schools. Schools in Finland are like palaces because they reflect the Finnish value system and the beliefs of Finnish people. Regardless of who one meets from the Finnish political system, whether left-wing, right-wing, centre-left, centre-right, far-left or far-right, all of them will tell visiting deputations, and I was a member of one such deputation, that the concept underpinning their education system is equality. Fundamentally, all of them believe in equality. In contrast, the Irish education system is underpinned by patronage and neither the child nor the employee is at its centre. Ideology and the rights of patrons to perpetuate their ethos are at the core of our education system. This approach also impacts on medical institutions.  While we are waiting for a revolution in this area - I will be at the front of it - we must deal with the current constitutional reality. Unfortunately, the constitutional constraints within which we operate mean that the best we can do is raise the bar. Notwithstanding these constraints, what we are doing is no mean achievement. I do not want anyone to conclude that my comments are undermining what the Bill will achieve for people working in the school system or a medical institution who believe they cannot be themselves. I am keenly aware of this issue, having dealt with it myself. While I would love to be in a position to delete section 37, to do so would create an open goal for those who want to do down this agenda and inevitably result in us having to deal with the existing section until we radically overhaul the education system, which could take forever. The European Union is happy for us to constitute our educate system in any way we wish. This is the system we have and I am trying to operate within it. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was unnerved for about 30 seconds when I found myself in agreement with Senator Mullen but then I was gratefully relieved by the rest of his contribution.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On amendments Nos. 1 and 3, it is important to note that the existing section 37(1), in permitting favourable treatment on the religion grounds or action to be taken in relation to the undermining of the institution's religious ethos, does not permit discrimination on any of the other grounds allowed in the Employment Equality Act 1988. However, it has had a chilling effect and it does not offer much guidance on the question of what undermining the religious ethos might mean in practice. We do not have any recent case law to guide us. A central feature of the Private Members' Bill in addressing this issue and which, on legal advice, we consider must be retained, is to distinguish between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes and those providing an educational or medical service to the public which is financed by State funding. We are advised that this is an important distinction that must be provided for to ensure the constitutionality of the Bill. There are competing constitutional rights involved: freedom of religion and freedom of association for religious groups, the freedom to establish and maintain their own institutions of various kinds, and the right of employees to be free of discrimination. There is a balance to be struck and the advice available to me, to present it in a positive way, is that the State has a stronger standing and arguably a duty to ensure persons whose salaries are paid directly or indirectly from the public purse are protected and that, in such circumstances, a stronger intervention in the employee-employer relationship than would be appropriate in the case of purely private religious institutions is justified. For that reason, I am unable to accept amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 13. I hope the Senators will accept my explanation and understand we cannot run the risk of the Bill being found to be unconstitutional on this point. I fear that amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13 would go too far. Are we discussing amendment No. 2? 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Okay. Members can predict what I will say on amendment No. 2.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Norris is holding the space over there. The suggestion that Ireland did not transpose the employment directive properly in section 37(1) has been addressed by the Attorney General in advice to the Department, quoting the text which is relevant here, Article 4.2: Member States may maintain national legislation in force at the date of adoption of this Directive or provide for future legislation incorporating national practices existing at the date of adoption of this Directive pursuant to which, in the case of occupational activities within churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of treatment based on a person's religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which they are carried out, a person's religion or belief constitute a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation's ethos. This difference of treatment shall be implemented taking account of Member States' constitutional provisions and principles, as well as the general principles of Community law, and should not justify discrimination on another ground. I am not seeking to defend the text of section 37(1) but there is no point starting from a false premise. Short of referring to section 37(1) in the text I quoted, the meaning could not be clearer. Article 4.2 was negotiated specifically by the Irish delegation at the time to ensure that the law as set out in section 37(1) would not be altered by the directive and would continue on the basis of a specific protection for its terms. The Commission, as guardian of the treaties, did subsequently institute infringement proceedings in relation to this specific issue and having considered the response from the Irish authorities closed the file on the matter. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We will have to agree to disagree. I do not agree with the Senator. My suggestion would be that an individual, privately funded church or congregation of people who have a particular belief system could legitimately take a case on the basis that it is a private institution, privately funded with a particular belief system and therefore is constrained by what we are trying to do here and could potentially win that case.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A thousand thoughts come to mind. On the amendment, teaching in a religious ethos school is not just about the teaching of religion. It should run through every subject taught and throughout the entire day. Technically, a teacher in a Catholic school is supposed to teach history, geography, mathematics etc. through the Catholic ethos. This is not only about the teaching of religion. In regard to the programme for Government, our determination was to establish a form of patronage and pluralism. The determination then was to examine the entire infrastructure of the school system in Ireland and the reality of there being 4,000 school buildings in a country with a population equal to that of Manchester. It is unsustainable to have that number of school buildings and so on in a country which, as I say, has a relatively small population in comparison with other countries in the European Union. However, some people did not play ball. They wanted to keep things as they are. In this regard, in terms of influence over children and education, this is the last hurrah for people of a certain mindset. On amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13, in my mind what it seeks goes too far. We have to accept that under the Constitution religious groups are free to establish their own institutions and can determine that religion or belief of employees is a genuine occupational requirement, even if the teaching of religion is not a direct feature of the particular post. I am unable to accept this particular amendment. This is an issue, and one not only relevant to religious institutions.What about a lobbying group that believes in human rights which has a reasonable expectation that someone working for it shares its belief system? What about someone working for a gay rights group, a women's rights group or a political party? Is it a reasonable expectation that an individual working in such an institution should share its mindset? It is not easy to nail down, which I totally accept. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on one's point of view, we have to accept that the Constitution is quite clear on this point.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Senator David Norris to our side of the House.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate from where Senator Katherine Zappone is coming. I am reminded of the G. K. Chesterton quote about Christianity, that it would be great if anybody bothered to try it. Addressing amendments Nos. 4 and 11 to amendment No. 13 together, there is a weight of volumes setting out the belief systems of individual churches and other religious groups. There are theological and practice differences not just between but also within particular denominations. There is a line which we should not cross. The State should not, as a matter of principle, involve itself in seeking to define - even indirectly - what individual denominations do or do not hold central to their ethos. If we want to achieve a genuine separation of church and State - I share this objective with the Senators - we should not start with the State putting a mechanism in place to regulate how religious groups define what they believe in.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The State should not find itself having to police these definitions in any way. Even if the State were to take that step, I suspect that, in practice, any such statement would be formulated at a sufficiently high level of abstraction to be of no particular use in dealing with the requirements we are setting out in amendment No. 13. I hope the Senators will accept the reason for my reluctance and not press the amendments. It would be great if we could have this done this evening.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I demand clarification on that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I had to resist the temptation to speculate on the number of individuals that constitute an orgy.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Possibly we should put down an amendment to clarify the matter. Amendments Nos. 5, 7, 8 and 10 take different forms and address the matter in different ways, but they have in common a focus on the employee's right to privacy. My Department has consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and I am happy in light of the consultation to accept the spirit of the amendments. Comparisons are invidious so I ask Members to forgive me, but in so far as a choice must be made, the style of amendment No. 5 conforms to the crisp and precise style in which the legislation is drafted. It captures the objective of the group of amendments without repeating the detail which I am advised is unnecessary. With the agreement of the House, I propose to accept amendment No. 5. On that basis, the other amendments might not be pressed. I understand I should move a verbal amendment at this stage as the insertion of a new subparagraph (iii) in subsection (1C)(c), which is proposed to be inserted by paragraph (b) of amendment No. 13, will require that the existing subparagraph (iii) is updated to subparagraph (iv). It is a consequential technical amendment arising from the acceptance of amendments Nos. 5 to No. 13. Perhaps the House can confirm its agreement to this change in the version of the Bill as proposed by the Seanad to be published after today's debate. Therefore I propose that in paragraph (c) of subsection (1C) proposed to be inserted by paragraph (b) of amendment No. 13, the existing subparagraph (iii) is renumbered as subparagraph (iv).
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendment No. 9 is a difficult one. Elements of what it seeks to achieve are contained within the text on privacy which we discussed earlier. I signalled acceptance of the amendment from Senator Zappone which is in concert with the broad principle of what Senator Averil Power is also seeking to achieve. Other elements cross the line into territory where the Supreme Court is likely to decide that the text should be struck down. As such, we have to be very careful. No employee is free to act against the interests of or campaign against the values or ethos of the employer. That is a fact that goes beyond considerations of whether the employer is a religious institution. For example, civil servants above a certain grade are not free to participate in politics or campaign on issues of political controversy. A similar situation exists for An Garda Síochána. I would like to be able to give definite advice on where the boundary might lie in respect of a range of possible circumstances but it is not possible to do that. The right to privacy encompasses freedom of expression, assembly and association to an extent but not to the extent that the exercise of these freedoms includes campaigning against and, in particular, visibly campaigning against one's employer or the employer's values and beliefs. While I appreciate the motivation behind the amendment, I am, unfortunately, unable to accept it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I disagree with the Senator. We are not afraid of something that is not there but are legislating for something that very much is there. We must be very mindful of it. While many school staffrooms are very inclusive places where people can be who they want, not every schoolteacher or medical professional feels the same, and we must ensure the chilling effect, as it has been described, ends. Senator Norris reminded me of a situation in which I was machine gunned with questions about my private life by students in my class who assumed I was gay because I was teaching in a girls' school. Then I got engaged and they saw a photograph of her.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They said: "God, Sir, your girlfriend is massive." In Sheriff Street, the word "massive" is a compliment. It is very different from Monaghan, where telling somebody their wife or girlfriend is massive has a different connotation. I had to spend a little time explaining that one. I digress. To speak bluntly to Senator Power's reservations, one cannot be seen to have been undermining anything if one answers a question factually. "Are you married?" "Yes, I am." That is not undermining anything, only stating a fact. It is not proselytising, undermining or campaigning. If somebody asks me, as a teacher, if I am running for election, the answer is yes. If somebody asks if I am running for the Labour Party, the answer is yes. If somebody asks if his or her mother should vote for the Labour Party, that is where the line is.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a well-established line. One person's interpretation of what a ring means is different from somebody else's. As Senator Bacik has clearly said, one's family status or civil status cannot be taken into consideration in these matters as undermining anything.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is explicit. There are nuances in schools and wearing a T-shirt with a particular political slogan on it would be considered inappropriate. There are many professions, such as the Garda Síochána and the Civil Service, in which expressions of political preference or ideology would not be appropriate. There is a line. If one answers a factual question and gives information that can be substantiated, it is not undermining anything. It is a statement of fact. “Are you married?” “Yes, I am.”
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is a statement of fact and it is explicit in the legislation that a person is not undermining anything by being who he or she is and having a marriage into which he or she has entered.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The intention of these amendments, which were introduced following consultation with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the environment, Community and Local Government, is to prohibit, in the provision of accommodation, discrimination in regard to a tenant or prospective tenant on the basis that the person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement, or that the person's income in whole or in part is or is not provided by a State as a relevant social welfare payment or by housing assistance payment. However, this will be without prejudice to the landlord's rights under any rule of enactment regulating the provision of accommodation and to the right of a person providing accommodation to require that rent supplement be paid directly to him or her. HAP is paid directly to landlords under separate legislative provisions, which do not need to be repeated in these provisions. The new "housing assistance ground" is drafted such that it applies only to the provision of rental accommodation, so as to avoid any unintended consequences. However, advertising is expressly captured because of the way in which the definition of "prohibited conduct" in section 2 of the 1998 Act operates. It is absolutely appropriate that a person who is in receipt of a rent supplement or assistance payment and can meet the rent set by a landlord should not be discriminated against simply because of the source of his or her income. We have a serious housing crisis in Dublin city and elsewhere in the State. This is a reform for which my Department can and has taken responsibility. It does not pretend it will solve our housing problems, but it is a small and necessary step in the right direction. I commend the amendments to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am very pleased to be before the House to present this Bill which provides for important changes to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 arising from the Government's initiative of 13 May to strengthen support for people in mortgage arrears. The main reform contained in the Bill is the new provision for independent review by the courts where a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, including arrears on the borrower's home mortgage, has been refused by creditors. Senators will recall that the PIA is a debt solution provided under the Act for dealing with secured debt such as home mortgages, and that, while respecting the rights of creditors, the PIA provides significant statutory protections for the debtor. These include keeping the debtor in his or her home where reasonably possible, the right to a reasonable standard of living while insolvent, and protection against any unilateral change to the arrangement. These statutory protections, which were debated at length by the Oireachtas, are not necessarily available to borrowers who enter an informal arrangement with their lenders, or who enter bankruptcy. That is why effective and early access to a PIA, where feasible, is an option of central importance for people struggling with long-term mortgage arrears. The new court review is a key reform, designed to ensure fair and sustainable debt restructuring proposals are upheld for borrowers who want to work their way out of debt with a view to keeping their homes. It will protect distressed mortgage holders from any unfair lack of cooperation by their banks, while respecting the legal rights of creditors. In particular, it will ensure a better balance between the interests of secured lenders and the interests of those facing unsustainable mortgages. It will also be accompanied by flanking support and information measures aimed at ensuring that those in serious mortgage debt can access practical help quickly and effectively. The second important proposal in the Bill is to increase the level of debt which may be included in a debt relief notice, DRN, from the current limit of €20,000 per person to €35,000. Senators will recall that a DRN is a debt solution provided under the Act for an insolvent person who is on a very low income, who does not own a property or any significant assets, and is weighed down by debts which he or she has no prospect of being able to pay. Another amendment removes a possible bar which might prevent a home owner who has entered a mortgage restructure from accessing a PIA if the restructure proves unsustainable. The third important element in this Bill provides more detailed powers for the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, in respect of promoting awareness and understanding of matters related to personal insolvency and bankruptcy and providing information and analysis of their operation in practice. Other provisions develop the ISI's supervisory powers regarding personal insolvency practitioners, in line with best practice regulatory standards. The Bill contains a number of technical amendments of a prudential or clarifying nature which I will come to later in my remarks. By way of background to the new court review, I would like to return to the broader context of insolvency policy and its interaction with the wider question of mortgage arrears. Senators will recall that the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 underlined that high levels of personal debt continue to threaten to exclude thousands of individuals and families from the economic recovery. In its report on mortgage arrears last July, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform referred at recommendations 46 and 47 to concerns about the potential costs of personal insolvency solutions, noted "the public refusal of some financial institutions to engage in any write-down of secured debt", contrary to the Government's policy in enacting the insolvency legislation, and recommended that the insolvency legislation be reviewed to mitigate against such a practice.I am pleased to say the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was able to respond on the issue of fees and costs by providing for a complete waiver of all fees payable to the insolvency service or the courts in respect of insolvency applications, with effect from last October. On the issue of engagement by financial institutions, Senators will remember that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, met the insolvency service and insolvency practitioners in early February this year, and that the Taoiseach spoke publicly after that meeting about the need for banks to co-operate more effectively with the personal insolvency regime. In her Second Stage speech in the Dáil on the Bill last February the Minister welcomed the gradual increase in the number of applications for personal insolvency solutions under the Act. She added that she wanted to see a more fundamental change in the overall number of solutions reached under the Personal Insolvency Act. The ISI statistics for quarter two of 2015 show 384 new personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, applications and 146 concluded PIAs during that quarter, with both rates continuing to increase steadily. However, these numbers remain very small compared with the numbers in serious mortgage arrears. The proportion of PIA proposals approved by creditors is also increasing, and stands at 73% for quarter 2 of 2015. Nevertheless, there remains persistent evidence that some secured creditors have an acknowledged policy of refusing to consider PIA proposals or wide categories of PIA proposals despite an apparent commercial rationale, and that consequently no proposal is ever made in many cases which would otherwise be considered as suitable. This is a serious concern and the need for the new court review arises against this overall background. In the past year we have seen a very welcome decline in the number of home mortgages which are in arrears, particularly in those in short-term arrears. On the other hand, some 38,000 principal dwelling house, PDH, mortgage accounts remain in long-term arrears exceeding 720 days. This substantial group is a source of major concern, as they are likely to be at imminent risk of losing their homes to repossession. The latest Central Bank statistics suggest a slight recent reduction, but we will need to see a very significant fall in these numbers in the coming year. There has also been a significant increase in the number of mortgages which were formerly in arrears, but which have been restructured by an agreement between the mortgage lender and the borrower. However, a cautionary note also has to be sounded regarding a proportion of these informal mortgage restructures which may not be sustainable and where the borrower has not been returned to solvency and risks falling back into arrears. There has also been extensive public debate and concern about recent increases in the number of repossession proceedings issued against borrowers' homes. While the number of actual repossessions remains low, it is a core Government priority that repossession of a borrower's home should remain an option of last resort. Clearly not all insolvent debtors are suitable for a PIA. Each case must be assessed fairly on its own facts. There will be cases in which the borrower does not have the financial capacity - even with mortgage restructuring - to make the necessary level of repayments. Such cases cannot be resolved via personal insolvency legislation, and will need alternative solutions such as expansion of the mortgage to rent scheme. In tandem with this reform to the Personal Insolvency Act, the Government is co-ordinating intensive work across all relevant Departments and agencies to deliver on the wider elements of the mortgage arrears initiative, including arrangements to deliver assistance and advice through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Insolvency Service of Ireland in the courts when repossession actions are taking place; enhanced and expanded arrangements for mortgage to rent; and a nationwide information and publicity campaign aimed at assisting those in serious mortgage arrears to engage with their lenders and with the courts where repossession proceedings have been initiated, coupled with an undertaking that, when they do engage, co-ordinated services will be there to assist them. The access and support measures are being implemented across the system at present, and will be in place for September. I turn now to the specific measures contained in the Bill, first to the new court review contained in section 21. Currently, under the Act, a proposed PIA is voted on by the creditors and must be approved by the necessary majorities of secured and unsecured creditors. If the creditors reject the proposal, there is no provision for a review or appeal. The new court review will change this situation. It applies to a PIA proposal which has been rejected by creditors; and which includes a mortgage on the borrower's home which was in arrears on 1 January 2015 or is a restructure of arrears from before that date. The date of 1 January 2015 is to avoid any negative impact on new mortgage lending. The proposal focuses on home mortgage arrears due to the priority of this particular group, and because the public policy issues arising in this context provide a particularly strong justification for rebalancing the rights of secured creditors. The personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, who prepared the proposal must confirm there are reasonable grounds for a review and that a majority of one class of creditors has voted for the proposal. This requirement for an element of creditor support reflects the approach used in company examinership, which was already signalled in the Government announcement on 13 May. However, it is not limited to the classes - secured debt, unsecured debt, overall debt - which voted at the creditors' meeting. It is a much lower and more flexible requirement. In the context of a court review, a "class of creditors" is widely defined and may consist of a single creditor, or of more than one creditor with similar interests. This flexible test will facilitate finding a solution which is fair and reasonable for all concerned, as it does in examinership, and the court will ensure that it is applied fairly. The Bill also provides for a significant exception to the creditor support requirement. In many cases involving a mortgage, the borrower has consolidated his or her debts with a single creditor. In these "sole creditor" cases, if the sole creditor refuses the PIA proposal, the debtor will not have to show any creditor support before seeking a court review. This exception effectively opens up the whole PIA process to a large number of cases where until now, no PIA proposal has even been made as it was felt that the sole creditor would be unlikely to agree to a deal offering statutory protection for the borrower. In reviewing the proposal, the court will consider whether it allows the borrower to stay in or keep their home if reasonably practicable, and if the costs are not disproportionately large; and whether it gives a reasonable prospect of restoring the borrower to solvency while repaying the creditors to the extent that the borrower's means reasonably allow. The court will also consider whether the proposal is reasonably likely to be one with which the borrower can comply, given the borrower's financial circumstances. If relevant, the court will consider whether the conduct of borrower and lender regarding repayment of the debt in the previous two years is fair and equitable to each class of creditors affected. It will also consider whether the proposal is unfairly prejudicial to any interested party and whether it has been accepted by a majority of one class of creditors which may consist of a single creditor or of more than one creditor with similar interests. This is the same flexible test, as has already been explained. Again, this element is not needed if the debtor has only one creditor.  These criteria have been carefully designed to ensure the review process takes full account of the situation and rights of both the borrower and the creditors, while also taking account of the public interest in restoring insolvent borrowers to solvency, enabling creditors to recover debts to the extent that the debtor's financial situation reasonably allows, and keeping people in their homes where that is reasonably practicable. The new court review will generally be heard by the specialist Circuit Court insolvency judges and will be heard in the High Court only where debts exceed €2.5 million. Delays are not expected. This new review is a major reform which represents a ground-breaking shift from the current position, and will significantly rebalance the position of creditors and debtors to ensure fair and balanced outcomes for both. Section 12 removes a potential bar to some insolvent borrowers being able to make a PIA proposal. It relates to people formerly in mortgage arrears on their homes who have entered an agreement to restructure their mortgage. Under section 91(1) of the Act, a borrower must co-operate with the mortgage lender under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, approved by the Central Bank. If the borrower does so, but is not able to agree a restructure with the mortgage lender, he or she is then eligible to propose a PIA. The question has arisen, however, as to eligibility where a borrower has co-operated in the MARP and has entered a MARP or non-MARP restructure but the restructure has failed or is unsustainable. It is clearly important that such a borrower can make a PIA proposal, and the amendment clarifies that they may do so if they have tried in good faith to comply with the restructure but remain insolvent. A debt relief notice, DRN, is a debt settlement measure under the Act limited to an insolvent person whose net disposable income after reasonable living expenses is less than €60 per month, and who has assets of €400 or less excluding basic household goods or tools, and a car worth €2,000 or less. Currently, the person's debts may not exceed €20,000. Section 3 proposes to increase this limit to €35,000 per person. This amount has regard to the experience of MABS, which acts as the PIP equivalent for DRNs under the Act, that the amount of debt held by applicants otherwise eligible for a DRN is commonly up to €35,000.This change will, I believe, open up the debt relief notice solution to a significant number of people who are not able to benefit from other statutory arrangements and whose debts, while relatively small, exceed the current limit. Section 2 expands the important functions of the insolvency service regarding information, awareness raising and communication in personal insolvency and bankruptcy matters. Sections 23 to 26, inclusive, provide more detailed and effective powers for the insolvency service to supervise the activities of personal insolvency practitioners. The Act already provides powers for the ISI to intervene if there is a complaint or other reason to check for any misconduct or non-compliance by a personal insolvency practitioner with their duties under the Act. This is a reactive power carried out by inspectors whose functions and powers are already provided for in the Act. However, it does not provide in the necessary detail for a proactive supervision power which would allow for routine inspection without any suggestion of misconduct. This is already the best practice standard for equivalent regulatory bodies and the Minister considers it appropriate, given the important statutory functions of PIPs. The Bill, therefore, provides for the Insolvency Service of Ireland to appoint authorised officers who will carry out the proactive supervision function with the appropriate powers. On the technical amendments in the Bill, I remind Senators that these clarify the existing rules for creditor voting but that where a personal insolvency arrangement proposal is rejected by creditors, the new court review will now be available. Their first objective is purely prudential and relates to a possible ambiguity identified in the wording of two sections of the Act, specifying the majority of creditors required to approve a debt settlement arrangement or PIA proposal at a creditors' meeting. The intention of the legislation and the interpretation applied by all stakeholders in practice is that such a proposal can be approved by creditors holding a specified majority of the overall debt. However, legal advice raised a possibility that the wording of sections 73 and 110 could be open to an alternative interpretation, that in addition the proposal must also be approved by a majority in number of all creditors, both for a DSA and for a PIA. Such an interpretation was never intended and would make it unnecessarily complicated to secure agreement on proposals. The relevant amendments remove the ambiguity and put the intended meaning beyond doubt. Their second objective is to clarify the detailed procedures which apply where creditors are deciding on a debtor's DSA or PIA proposal. Normally, the decision is taken by a vote at a creditors' meeting, the standard scenario, for which the Act sets out detailed procedures regarding notice, time limits, and so on. However, the Act also provides for two alternative scenarios. Where only one creditor is entitled to vote at a creditors' meeting, the creditor may notify its decision without the need to hold a creditors' meeting. Where a creditors' meeting is held but no creditor votes, the debtor's proposal is deemed to be accepted by the creditors. The Act does not always specify how the detailed procedures set out for the standard scenario would translate into the two alternative scenarios. The amendments clarify how that would be done. I wish to underline the urgency of those changes in the Bill which arise from the Government's decision of 13 May. We are conscious that many of those in long-term mortgage arrears are increasingly at risk of losing their homes and are often highly stressed by their situation. It is important the court review and the flanking measures I have mentioned are put in place quickly and are fully available by September. Subject to Senators' deliberations, therefore, I hope the Bill will pass all Stages before the summer recess. I look forward to hearing Senators' views on the Bill and I am pleased to commend it to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, rith an seanfhocal a bhíodh ann tráth dá raibh, "Céard a dhéanfadh mac an chait ach luch a mharú liom" - what would the son of the cat do only kill a mouse? When one is dealing with an amoral system, regulations will always be catching up in relation to such amorality. On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Members of the House for the useful exchange of views. It is good to hear that there is recognition on both sides of the House of the necessity for this legislation and that it will improve matters, although I appreciate some Members are of the opinion that it does not go far enough. The Minister looks forward to further discussing the Bill's various provisions with the Senators in the coming period. It is an important piece of legislation and one which is urgently needed. The change to eligibility limits for a debt relief notice will bring immediate help to persons with very limited income who are not property owners and who are weighed down by debts and have no prospect of being able to pay. The new provision for a court review will help, in particular, the substantial number of persons who want to pay their mortgage and remain in their homes but who, in reality, are insolvent and are struggling to pay their debts. It offers a new guarantee that a reasonable personal insolvency proposal put forward by such a borrower under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 will be fairly considered and provides for a refusal by creditors to be reviewed, where appropriate, by the court which will have power to impose the proposal if it finds it is fair and sustainable. The court will decide accordingly to carefully balance the criteria, which ensures appropriate protection for the borrower and for the public interest while taking full account of the rights of all parties concerned. Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill asked why there were so few cases and inadequate responses. The review addresses precisely the two main reasons for the low number of cases which have been identified. First, borrowers do not bring cases because they believe banks have a veto. The new court review addresses that point. Second, those in serious debt do not know where to turn and new independent advice and consistent measures currently being put in place address that difficulty. In terms of why borrowers are not coming forward, there has been extensive consultation with stakeholders, in particular, organisations assisting those in serious debt, as to the reasons borrowers are not coming forward to take forward the options available. The new framework to assist those in mortgage arrears is designed specifically to respond to the reasons identified in these consultations. I would say that the lack of confidence in the ISI was not cited as a difficulty by those concerned. I was asked why the Bill made such a limited range of changes and why it did not simplify the rules for obtaining a protective certificate. The Bill makes a number of urgent priority changes, in particular, the introduction of the court reviews in order that these can be put in place by September. It does not mean that other changes arising from the ongoing review of the legislation will not be made as the question of streamlining procedures for a protective certificate is under consideration in that context, which involves complex drafting changes which cannot be made quickly. Unfortunately, it is a continuing process. In terms of resources for accessing the court review procedure, the Minister is aware of the importance of this question and it is being considered within the ongoing cross-departmental work on a framework for advice and assistance. Senator Aideen Hayden made a number of points about bankruptcy reform. The Minister for Justice and Equality sent a request on 26 May last to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality asking that it might consider the substantial issues under public debate regarding bankruptcy policy, including the role of bankruptcy in resolving indebtedness and the possibility of further reducing the bankruptcy period which is currently three years to one year with the hope the committee might be able to revert with its views before the summer recess. The committee sent its report to the Minister last week and she is considering its recommendations carefully. However, this is not a question which can feasibly be included in this Bill if the review and assistance measures are to be in place by September. Senator Aideen Hayden made a comment about the conduct of lenders. The Senator may wish to note that the conduct of the lender is expressly included in the new provision on court review in section 21 as a factor which the court can take into account in its review. A number of the points were well made during the course of the debate. As some Members said, we are taken with the pressures that are placed on families and individuals and the stresses and strains that occupy their minds when this issue comes to their door. Collectively, we are conscious of that and are working hard to alleviate that pressure. This is a major and important reform. The Minister has indicated it will be accompanied in September by a suite of measures, some of which are being piloted, to ensure independent advice and support are easily accessible to the distressed borrowers in arrears on home mortgages and to help them engage as early as possible and find the best solutions in order that repossession of the borrower's home remains, as always, a last resort.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«In my short time here, I have listened to contributions from both sides that have been constructive. I have also listened to much rhetoric on the issue in the Dáil. While I do not like being party political about it, rhetoric such as "bully tactics", "ruthlessness" and "intimidation" coming from Sinn Féin are galling in the extreme.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Such accusations, coming from Sinn Féin in particular, are remarkable and do nothing to debate properly the issues at hand. The Senator should reflect on the choice of language that was provided for him, from wherever it came.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senators who decided to be constructive in their contributions. The Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill represents a balanced measure which provides creditors with improved enforcement mechanisms for modest debts and provides strong safeguards for debtors. The Bill abolishes imprisonment, an important point to stress and something I assume people would generally be in favour of, and provides two new District Court measures for the recovery of modest debts between €500 and €4,000 in value. The provisions of the Bill will be available to a wide range of creditors, although some seem to be obsessed with Irish Water. The measures are fair and balanced and ensure consideration of a debtor's ability to pay a debt is the key element of the court process. The Bill ensures debtors will not be subject to an attachment or deduction order that would bring their income below a reasonable standard. The Bill does not target any particular group. Debt enforcement and the recovery of moneys owed is part of any normal economic activity. If it were not the case, how would businesses survive? The Bill ensures those who owe money and have the capacity to pay something towards the debt do so. Those who cannot pay are protected by the very significant safeguards the Minister outlined in her opening speech. There have been a number of gross exaggerations, including a suggestion that compliance with an attachment of earnings order would be a bureaucratic nightmare for employers or undermine employer-employee relations. Employers have either in-house or outsourced access to payroll systems. In the operation of these systems, deductions and pay-over is an everyday occurrence, whether for taxes, union subscriptions or credit union payments. Attachment of earnings systems are working in a range of other jurisdictions and have not caused the sky to fall in regarding employer-employee relations. In such situations, employees are protected by employment law protections such as those against unfair dismissals. Some Senators have suggested the legislation makes attachment and deduction orders a first resort rather than a last resort, which is untrue. Before a creditor can go to court for an attachment or deduction order, he or she must first have obtained a court judgment order in respect of the debt. Before this happens, the debtor will have had a full opportunity to make an arrangement with the creditor regarding payment of the debt. Following that, the creditor must go to court a second time to secure an attachment or deduction order. The debtor will have had another opportunity before this to make arrangements to pay the debt. The Bill specifically provides that the court may adjourn an attachment or deduction application if it believes the debtor will pay the debt within a reasonable period. If an attachment or deduction order is made under the legislation, it will be the culmination of a substantial series of processes within which there will have been extensive opportunities for a debtor to make arrangements to settle the debt. The Bill represents a balanced measure on the enforcement of debt and will be a welcome addition to the existing measures available to creditors to seek repayment of moneys owed to them. I will address some of the more constructive questions asked. I was not here for all of Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill's contribution, but will respond to his point about the establishment of a debt enforcement office. We regard this as an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy in the context of the measures. A number of the core issues regarding attachment of earnings and deduction of social welfare, which were raised in the LRC report, are reflected in the safeguards in the legislation. Senator Jillian van Turnhout made a point about the courts guidance on reasonable living expenses, and many people are asking why, if it was included in the personal insolvency legislation, it is not included in this Bill. They are two different concepts. The personal insolvency legislation is framed on the assumption that the creditor is insolvent and is seeking to have some or all of his or her debt written off. The concept of "reasonable living expenses" has a different context in that scenario. The Bill deals with debtors' capacity to pay money they owe to creditors. The provisions ensure courts have sufficient information available on people's financial circumstances. Courts are also obliged to take into account any representations debtors may make about their circumstances. For example, obligations towards family members might be taken into account in assessing their ability to repay debts. The courts already have a body of expertise on the matter. For example, the District Courts have considerable experience of living expenses regarding attachment orders which arise in the context of family law proceedings. It is preferable to allow the court full discretion in assessing a debtor's capacity to repay a debt. Every circumstance will be different, as the Senator will appreciate. Individual circumstances will vary from debtor to debtor, and the courts should be allowed to make their own decisions on these matters. There is nothing to prevent a court from having regard to the insolvency service's guidelines if it so wishes and there is no need to make an explicit provision for it in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien. Section 1(4) applies with equal force to all four Houses of the Oireachtas officer posts under consideration in the Bill. In taking this approach the Government has in mind that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle, would have the latitude in the future to take decisions on the tenure of the relevant postholders which would be in the best interests of an effective and efficient Oireachtas Service. It does not see any justification for making a distinction between the Clerk of the Dáil and the other three posts. It is very conscious that if the amendment were to be accepted, there would be an anomalous position, whereby the occupant of the Clerk of the Dáil post would have a seven-year tenure, while those appointed to the other three posts after the departure of the existing occupants would potentially have a much longer tenure, until they reached normal retirement age. The Government strongly believes this would lead to much inflexibility in the management of the staff resources of the Oireachtas. It would also be at odds with practice in the public service generally. The Government and its predecessor are on record as wishing to afford the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission the opportunity to operate an homogenised management structure in the service. Explicitly mentioning in legislation the authority of the commission to specify lengths of tenure for the four main officer of the Houses posts is a significant step in this direction. The Government believes its proposals will amount to a significant transfer of power from the Executive to the Legislature, as in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The Taoiseach is heavily involved in the process. The commission is representative of parliamentarians and will be fully attuned to their needs and demands. I draw Senators' attention to the fact that under the terms of the proposed legislation successful nominees for the posts of Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the Dáil and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad will be confined to serving members of the Oireachtas Service. This gives me very solid grounds for expecting that the successful candidates will have a wide experience of parliamentary and electoral procedure and the work of the various commissions such as the SIPO and the Referendum Commission, with which they are associated. The Government does not share the concerns expressed about adverse consequences for the work of these commissions or the conduct of elections. When the tenure of the holder of any of the three posts I have mentioned ends, the commission will be at liberty to decide whether to maintain the postholder in his or her posting or transfer him or her to a post in the Oireachtas. A significant number of posts in the service are of equivalent rank such as principal officer or assistant principal officer. In the light of the points I have made, the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senators for their contributions. I appreciate where people are coming from in respect of this issue.  Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned the Ceann Comhairle. The Ceann Comhairle is the chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, not just the Dáil, and the commission is representative of parliamentarians. This Government and the previous one are anxious to give the commission maximum flexibility. That is the motivation behind the Bill. As in every other facet of the public service, flexibility is required, and we are trying to ensure we can maximise the potential for flexibility. In terms of the points being made about fixed terms - I did give the example of seven years - Secretaries General of Departments are also appointed for fixed terms; therefore, there is a precedent for this within the public service.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like to respond to the reasonable questions asked about the office of the Clerk of the Seanad. Under the Bill, there are positions in the Oireachtas to which the Clerk of the Seanad could be transferred. While I appreciate that the Opposition amendment is intended to be constructive, its effect would be to leave officers in office for life without that mobility. It would leave the Clerk of the Seanad, for example, in office for life. I do not think that is necessarily the intention of the amendment, but it would be its effect.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is my understanding, based on the advice we have been given, that it is not unusual for principal officers in the public service to have fixed terms.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I reiterate that it is the intention to fill the posts from within the Oireachtas. The main reason I do not propose to accept the amendment is that the proposal, if implemented, would leave officers in situ for life.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator and I will not agree on this issue. To be constructive, I will repeat the advice available to me. The current arrangement under the 1959 Act is left in place, which means that the Clerk of the Seanad can remain until the age of 65 years.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien and the Leader of the House for coming to an accommodation on the previous amendment. I remind Senators that it is always a benefit to everyone if the hyperbole is kept to a minimum. To suggest this will rock the very foundations of the entire public service is stretching it seeing as the legislation only affects the Oireachtas. On the matter raised by Senator Paul Bradford, it was discussed when the Bill was proceeding through the Dáil. The Government was not prepared to accept the amendment proposed in that Chamber and is not prepared to do so now. It is because it is not believed there is any justification for transferring responsibility for this matter to the Secretary General. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has a statutory function in preparing guidelines for Members in the use of accommodation following dissolutions. The office of the superintendent supports the commission in carrying out its statutory function. Following on from this, the matter of accommodation is for the Chief Whip and the other Whips. In the event of difficulties, the matter is decided upon by the Ceann Comhairle in his capacity as chairperson of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The Ceann Comhairle's decision is final. The proposed amendment will reduce the powers of the Ceann Comhairle and the commission and the Government would be unwilling to become involved in the matter which is for the Legislature to deal with. In addition, implementation of the proposal would lead to the Secretary General and Clerk of the Dáil being caught up in a political matter.My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stated in the Dáil:[T]he proposed amendment would, in my judgment, ultimately reduce the powers of the independently elected Chair of Dáil Éireann to make decisions in the event of disagreements or disputes. My honest view of what is right is this is a better way than giving it to any administrator who would be caught in a political controversy ... and this is not a fair or reasonable place to put any administrator in the House.This remains the Government view and, accordingly, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«In accordance with Standing Order 136, I wish to direct the Clerk to make a number of minor drafting corrections to the text of the Bill. They are corrections of a verbal or formal nature which are being made in the interests of textual clarity and do not result in any change to the substantive meaning of that text. The changes are as follows: in page 3 of the Bill, line 26, to delete the comma after "respects"; in page 3 of the Bill, line 27, to delete the comma after "insolvent debtors"; in page 24 of the Bill, line 8, to delete "the" where it secondly occurs; in page 33 of the Bill, line 28, to delete the colon after "modifications" and replace it with a dash; in page 33 of the Bill, line 31, to delete the semicolon after "arrangement" and replace it with a comma; in page 33 of the Bill, line 33, to delete the semicolon after "section" and replace it with a comma; and in page 34 of the Bill, line 1, to delete "the" where it secondly occurs.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No; the amendments concern different lines in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They were actually notified to the Bills Office.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We can make copies available.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can clarify.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete text from an amendment to section 91 of the principal Act. The effect of the Senators' amendment is to remove the reference in the principal Act to co-operation with the MARP before a borrower makes a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement. I thank the Senators for their amendment, but I cannot accept it. Under the existing section 91(1), a borrower must first co-operate with the mortgage lender under the MARP approved by the Central Bank, before he or she can make a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement. If the borrower does so, but is not able to agree a restructure with the mortgage lender, he or she is then eligible to propose a personal insolvency arrangement. The current provision does not address the situation of a borrower who has been in mortgage arrears on his or her home, has co-operated with the MARP and has subsequently entered a restructure, whether MARP or non-MARP, but the restructure has failed, or is unsustainable, and the borrower remains insolvent. It is important that a borrower in this situation should be eligible to make a PIA proposal. This section of the Bill is designed to expand the categories of person who can apply under section 91 and to ensure there is no bar to an insolvent borrower in such a restructured mortgage situation being eligible to make a PIA proposal. This section, therefore, already seeks to significantly enlarge the categories of persons who may apply for a personal insolvency arrangement and to ensure a person in a restructured home mortgage will be able to do so. To remove the link to co-operation with the MARP for any borrower wishing to propose a PIA goes well beyond the scope of the amendment and would require very full policy consideration, not least due to its possible negative effects on incentives for borrowers to engage as early as possible with their lenders regarding any repayment difficulties.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can confirm that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendment No. 2 seeks to delete section 21(18) of the Bill, which defines "relevant debt" for the purpose of a court review. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to remove the definition of the type of debt that may be the subject of an application for the new court review. I thank the Senator for his amendment, but I cannot accept it. First, this amendment risks creating legal uncertainty. Subsection (1) already provides that the new court review refers to a person with a relevant debt. Removing the definition would risk leaving it unclear who could apply for a review. This uncertainty has to be avoided, particularly given the urgency of making the review available to borrowers in long-term arrears who urgently need solutions. Second, the definition of "relevant debt" in subsection (18) targets the review at those who are most in need - people who are in mortgage arrears on their home or in a restructure of such arrears which has not returned them to solvency. It is the Government's policy to prioritise this group. Removing the definition could open up the review to any person proposing a personal insolvency arrangement, including a person whose difficulties relate, for example, to five buy-to-let properties. This may seem superficially attractive. However, it would carry a risk of legal uncertainty.  I strongly underline that the Government's proposal has been very carefully designed and balanced to take full account of the very difficult legal territory of potentially providing for imposed solutions which could impinge on the property rights of secured lenders. Following extensive deliberation and legal advice, the Government believes the Bill is constitutionally robust. An important element, however, is that the Bill concentrates on risk to the borrower’s home where the social policy justification for Government intervention, both regarding the borrower and the implications for public housing and other public policies, is at its strongest. To make the changes proposed by the Senators would disturb this careful balance and risk opening up the Bill to legal challenges. That would be extremely damaging to the situation of homeowners in serious mortgage arrears who are in urgent need of solutions. For these reasons, the Government cannot accept the proposed amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senator for his contribution. I am advised that the review is limited to arrears before January 2015 or restructures of such arrears to prevent negative implications for new mortgage lending. Extending the new review to arrears built up from this year onwards would risk increasing mortgage interest rates on new lending, something we are determined to avoid.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I will stick to my speaking note, even though I am very tempted to move off script. I understand Senators are opposing this section. I understand they are ideologically opposed to the provisions of the Bill which deal with attachment of earnings and deductions from social welfare payments. I will briefly outline the purpose of section 1. Section 1 is the definitions section of the Bill. Among the terms defined is "net scheme payments", which is required for the purposes of dealing with deductions from certain social welfare payments. "Debt" is defined as not including debts arising from the repayment of loans to a debtor made by a bank, credit union, moneylender or credit card debt. It is important to note that "net scheme payments" is a definition which protects those on social welfare because it ensures the deductions from a social welfare recipient's payments do not dip below the basic social welfare rate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I note that Senators are also opposed to section 2. Section 2 is a standard provision relating to the making of regulations under the Bill when enacted. The Minister for Justice and Equality will be making a commencement order under the provisions of section 27. Under section 7(4), the Minister for Social Protection may, by regulations, prescribe the verifying certificate. In sections 24(1) and (2) the Minister for Social Protection, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality, may, by regulations, prescribe a social welfare scheme for the purposes of deductions under this legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I understand Senators are opposed to the section which deals with the statement of the debtor’s means. I appreciate that they are trying to be as constructive as possible. Section 7 sets out the requirements in relation to the information to be provided to the court by the judgment debtor on his or her financial circumstances. In order for the court to establish the debtor’s capacity to pay, it must have sufficient information on the debtor’s circumstances, including his or her financial circumstances. The judgment debtor, on receipt of a notice under section 6, is required to complete a statement of means providing details of his or her income and financial commitments. Where the debtor is a social protection recipient, he or she will be required to request a certificate from the Department of Social Protection verifying his or her payments. This ensures the court has accurate information on the debtor’s social protection payments to assist it in coming to a view on affordability. This certificate will outline, in particular, what portion of the payment is personal to the debtor, what portion is in respect of his or her dependants, and whether there are any deductions being made from the social protection payment. The certificate will not be disclosed by the court to the judgment creditor. The court is empowered to request further supporting documentation from the debtor, or his or her employer, if so required. The statement of means provided for the court and the verifying certificate from the Department of Social Protection shall be admissible in evidence. Senators also referred to the statement of means.The statement of means will be drawn up under rules of court. It will be along the lines of the forms in use in family maintenance cases and those which will be introduced in the context of attachment of earnings orders for the payment of criminal fines. The debtor’s personal public service number, PPSN, will not be shared with the creditor or the court. This was made clear in the amendments the Minister tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil. It is not possible for these matters to be dealt with in camera. The legal system operates on the basis that justice must be seen to be done in public. Accordingly, there are limited circumstances in which court hearings may be held in camera. It is not the case that an employer will see all of a debtor’s private financial information. The employer will be served with the court order by the creditor. It will set out what deductions must be made over a specified period, as set out in section 10(6). It will not give the debtor’s financial information. Is the debtor having to provide a copy of his or her completed statement of means to the creditor, as well as to the court, a breach of the debtor’s privacy? It is normal in civil cases to have an exchange of documents between the parties concerned. However, the statement of means which is to be prescribed under the rules of court and the verifying certificate which is to be prescribed by the Minister for Social Protection will have to be drawn up carefully in order that sensitive information on the debtor is not disclosed. I appreciate the sensitivity of these issues and hope I have clarified matters for the Senators.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Section 9 provides that an attachment of earnings order and a deduction from social welfare payments order cannot be run concurrently in respect of the same judgment debt. In the event that a debtor is in receipt of a social welfare payment and earnings, the court can only make an order in respect of one income stream.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Before I deal with section 10, I understand a correction by the Clerk is required under Standing Order 136. On page 12, line 9, paragraph (f) of section 10(6), as it stands, contains an incorrect cross-reference to paragraph (c). It should, of course, be paragraph (d). I would be grateful, therefore, if this typographical error could be corrected by the Clerk. Amendment No. 1 seeks the deletion of the existing subsection 10(3) and its substitution with new text which seeks to provide that the court shall be guided by the Insolvency Service of Ireland's reasonable living expenses guidelines when making an attachment of earnings order. I can understand the Senators' concerns around this issue. As I said on Second Stage, there is nothing to prevent the court from having regard to those guidelines if they so wish, but there is no need to make such a provision in the Bill. When I spoke about this matter on Second Stage, I said I thought it was preferable to allow the court full discretion in assessing a debtor's capacity to repay a debt. Individual circumstances will vary from debtor to debtor, and the court should be allowed to make its own decision relating to these matters. While I understand the motivation of the Senators who have proposed the amendment, they may well find that the court has more latitude in determining living expenses and may be more generous to debtors if it is not obliged to have regard to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines.  As I said during the Second stage debate, reasonable living expenses have a different context in respect of personal insolvency. The Bill deals with the debtor's capacity to pay money that he or she owes to a creditor. Its provisions ensure the court will have sufficient information available to it relating to the person's financial circumstances. The court is also obliged to take into account any representations the debtor may make in relation to his or her circumstances. It is important to remember that the courts already have a body of expertise relating to this matter and they will approach it in a sensible manner. There is nothing to prevent a court from having regard to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines, if it so wishes. There is simply no need to make an explicit provision for this in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«While I appreciate that the Senators are coming at this from the point of view of being constructive, we will have to agree to disagree.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the motivation of Senators in tabling the amendments. It is fair enough and these issues should be examined in detail when dealing with legislation of this nature. I have no difficulty with this whatsoever. The section deals with compliance with an attachment order. The employer is required to comply with the order but is not liable for non-compliance during the first ten days. This is to allow for a situation where the person served with the order is not the person's employer, in which case the person concerned is required to notify the court accordingly. Provision is also made in subsection (4) for a situation where the debtor changes employment. Subsection (5) provides that the lapse of an order under subsection (4) does not prevent it remaining in force for other purposes. With regard to employer and employee relations, employees are protected by unfair dismissal legislation and other employment law. The Attorney General has advised that unfair dismissal issues are already covered in Irish law and protections are adequate to deal with any issues which might arise regarding any attempt to discriminate against somebody solely on the basis of being the subject of an attachment of earnings order or, as the Senators mentioned, the possibility that a prospective employer might not employ someone because he or she is subject to an attachment of earnings order. We will monitor the situation very closely because we appreciate the statements made by Senators. Should any difficulties of this nature emerge we will take action to ensure it does not continue. It is important to say attachment of earnings orders are common in other countries such as the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and Australia. Irish employers are already required to implement attachment of earnings orders for family maintenance and recovery of social protection overpayments. This is not necessarily new ground.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Section 6 is a standard provision which ensures a convention judgment in respect of which an enforcement order has been issued shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court. The purpose of the amendment is to make this section subject to section 7 of the Bill. The reason for this is as follows. Section 7 makes special provision for the payment of interest on foreign judgments, with subsection (4) of that section specifying that it is only the provisions of that section which will apply to the payment of interest in such judgments. The background to this is that an award of interest on a claim is an integral part of the judgment and therefore it is appropriate that the interest provisions of the country where the judgment was given shall apply and not the Irish provisions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The new section 9 has the effect of giving an explicit jurisdiction to the Master of the High Court to grant protective measures to a judgment creditor where that creditor seeks such measures in the context of applying to have their convention judgment enforced. In the absence of such a power, there would be a risk that a judgment debtor would be given the opportunity to put assets in Ireland beyond the reach of the creditor before enforcement could take place. Article 7 of the convention makes it clear that interim measures of protection not governed by the terms of the convention and their granting or otherwise are matters to be regulated by national law. Under national law, in the absence of an express provision, the courts would not have jurisdiction to grant these measures in respect of convention judgments.  Following further consideration of this matter, it has been decided that it would not be in keeping with the spirit of the convention if, in the context of an enforcement application, every effort was not made to ensure enforcement would be effective. For that reason, a provision akin to that in respect of the Brussels I Regulation and the Lugano Convention regimes is proposed to be introduced for Hague Convention purposes. Amendment No. 4 is a consequential amendment attendant on the insertion of the new section 9 and relates to the collective citation of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2015.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The effect of the amendment will be to remove the need for a commencement order in order that the Bill will enter into force immediately on enactment.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senator for raising this issue. She will be aware that, in accordance with the Health Act 1970, as amended, full eligibility and a medical card is awarded where a person cannot arrange GP services for himself or herself and his or her family without undue hardship, having regard to his or her financial circumstances. In the situation outlined by the Senator, it is possible for a student who has income of €164 or more to be assessed in his or her own right for a medical card and the medical card status of the parents is not a relevant factor. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has not been made aware of any instances where problems referenced by the Senator have arisen and she has not provided details of any individual case. Should the Senator wish to provide information concerning a specific applicant, the national medical card unit would be happy to undertake a review and revert directly. Eligibility under the medical card scheme for persons aged 16 to 25 years is assessed by reference to the HSE's medical card and GP visit card national assessment guidelines which state that persons aged 16 to 25, who are dependent on medical cardholders, are eligible for a medical card. A 16 to 25 year old is classed as a dependant if he or she is living with parents or a guardian or living away from home attending school or college and has no income or a weekly income less than €164. Where an applicant in this age bracket is earning more than €164 per week, then he or she is assessed as being financially independent. The figure of €164 is the current medical card income guideline for a single person living with family. Where deemed appropriate, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, for example, costs arising from an illness. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE as is evidenced by the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation, which has increased from approximately 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 on 1 November this year. On foot of the Keane report, published last year, the HSE established a clinical advisory group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system. The group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. I hope this clarifies the matter for the Senator and reassures her that the HSE endeavours to operate in a fair manner within its legislative framework.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am not going to read out the report for the Senator. I am not going to go through the 26 recommendations that are covered and those that are not. I am here to speak on the Bill. If the Senator wants me to speak to amendments, I will do so. If he wants me to go through the entirety of the working group report on the protection process, I will not do so. The report is an historic document because it marks the first time in the history of the direct provision system that this issue is actually being reformed. I will not go through each and every recommendation. Many of them are works in progress. I am here to speak on the Bill and to the amendments that have been proposed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is the protection Bill. It deals with a large number of the recommendations set out in the report of the working group on direct provision. The system of direct provision has been a disaster for the families involved. It was a six-month solution that turned into a 12-year or 13-year solution. Nobody who is engaged in this process ever suggested the direct provision system be abolished. I never said it. Nobody I know who has a sense of what the issues are would suggest that it be abolished. If we abolish direct provision, many asylum seekers will end up homeless. That was the reality in 2000 when the system came into operation. There were reports of people seeking asylum in this country sleeping in parks. The system of direct provision was entered into to provide short-term accommodation for individuals who are in desperate need. I could stand over that system if the accommodation was of an excellent standard, if the system was family-centred, if the individuals within the system were treated with dignity and if applications were dealt with speedily, transparently and fairly. I cannot stand over it if the accommodation becomes somebody's long-term home. Is the Senator is suggesting we put everybody who seeks asylum in this country on the housing list or in homeless accommodation?That will be the direct result of the abolition of the direct provision system. The overarching problem with the system of direct provision is the length of stay. I have always said I can stand over a system in which people live with dignity and respect for a period of months in a centre that looks after them and cares for their needs. I cannot stand over a system which effectively becomes an institution in which families and children grow up. The length of stay is the issue. If we abolish direct provision we must prepare for 3,000 applicants a year on housing lists throughout the country and parks filled with people sleeping on benches. That is what we had in 2000 and I will not return to it. I will stand over a system of direct provision as a short-term solution which solves people's accommodation needs as they seek an application for protection in this country. If it is positively received they will have leave to remain and if it is not they must leave. This is the reality. It comes as no surprise to me that those who protest about the abolition of direct provision have slogans with no effect on real life. In fairness, Senators have worked very hard on this issue. There is no far-right lunatic conservative voice in this or the other Chamber demanding a tougher stance. We are all looking for a humanitarian response. Throwing out one-liners and hashtags to abolish direct provision is fine but it is not a solution. This is the solution. This is why I say we should pick through the individual amendments and work collectively to achieve something and not waste our time on grandstanding.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What is the alternative? The Senator does not have one.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What is your alternative?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«You do not have one.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«All of these are Government amendments apart from amendment No. 231 in the name of Senator Denis O'Donovan. They relate mainly to the insertion of references to an international protection officer instead of an authorised officer. Authorised officer had been used initially as a standard formulation. The new insertions better reflect the functions to be carried out by such officers under the Bill. Not surprisingly, therefore, according to amendment No. 1 the old references to authorised officers or persons are deleted. As work is ongoing on the definition, which will be shaped by the functions under the finalised Bill, I will not move amendment No. 3 but instead will come back to it at a later point if it proves necessary. I will not move amendment No. 159 for similar reasons. Amendment No. 231 proposes the insertion of a reference to a valid search warrant. I wish to clarify the purpose of this section is to address a number of loopholes which emerged in the existing section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999 relating to the State's capacity to remove from the State persons who have no entitlement to be here. The existing provisions of section 5(1) of the 1999 Act, which I restate in the proposed replacement section, already permits the arrest of persons against whom a deportation order is enforced on various grounds. The proposed text of the new section 5(11) of the 1999 Act permits entry to a dwelling for the purpose of making the arrest. The provision follows very closely the term of section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999. That section also permits entry to a premises without a warrant. In both cases there are safeguards in that the consent of the occupier will be required, save where the person to be arrested normally resides there or the immigration officer or member of An Garda Síochána believes on reasonable grounds that the person is within the dwelling. Clearly, the provision does not permit speculative entry without consent. It should also, therefore, be borne in mind that if a person leaves the State when he or she is supposed to this situation does not arise.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My information is that the grouping comprises all Government amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 231 in the name of Senator Denis O'Donovan.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator is making a reasonable point.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a timing issue. Amendment No. 230 has to be passed. Our intention is to not move the amendment and then come back to it at a later stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is a group of Government amendments relating to the use of the term "legal assistance" instead of "free legal assistance", as used in the published version of the Bill. The term "legal assistance" is defined in section 2 of the Bill as including legal aid legal advice. Therefore, we are adjusting the wording across the Bill to reflect this.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«These Government amendments are correcting cross-references and numbers across the Bill and, therefore, are of a technical nature.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will go through the responses. The view is not to accept amendment No. 6. The term "Representative" is not used in the Bill and therefore does not need to be defined in section 2. The only reference in the Bill is to a legal representative, which is defined. Amendment No. 7 refers to page 10, line 27. Is that correct? I need your assistance, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can give an individual answer to each amendment, but unfortunately my answers are detailed in respect of their position in the Bill and their numbering. I may need your guidance.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will address amendment No. 7 first. The relevant term does not need to be defined. It is not a term used in the text of the Bill. All children who arrive in the State are protected by the provisions of the Bill and the best interests of the child are paramount. Amendment No. 8 is next. The Bill reflects the EU directive in respect of where a stateless person is not defined and therefore the amendment is not being accepted. I will not accept amendment No. 19. The applicant will be asked his or her date of birth as part of his or her initial interview. That is how the situation will be dealt with. Amendment No. 20 is next in the grouping. My view and the view of the Department is not to accept the amendment. We are concerned that the suggested amendment is too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person. That is not covered in the suggested amended text. Amendment No. 26 would replace “information” and substitute “information, including legal advice” as the basis on which the Child and Family Agency shall arrange for the appointment of an employee or other person to make an application for international protection on behalf of a child in respect of whom he or she is providing care and protection. This reflects the reality that legal advice may be relevant in the operation of the subsection by the agency in respect of an individual child. Amendment No. 27 is next in the group. Is that correct?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not have a note on that matter. I am awaiting a note on that amendment. The Department's view is to accept this. The paragraph should be amended to include the legal advice. I want to ensure I have that absolutely correct.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to be certain I have the right amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My notes refer to lines 36 and 37, but it is the same amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not have a note on that matter. I might come back to amendment No. 27, if that is okay. Amendment No. 136 refers to page 39. Is that correct?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The idea is that section 34(3) already provides that interviews shall be conducted by persons who are sufficiently competent to take account of the personal or general circumstances surrounding the applicant's origin or vulnerability. We will not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 138 is next. The idea is that section 35(c) provides that the report of the personal interview, together with the report under section 38 in respect of the child's application, is prepared by a person with the necessary knowledge of the special needs of minors.Amendment No. 142 is-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The view is that the section provides that the report of the personal interview, together with the report under section 38 in respect of the child’s application, is prepared by a person with the necessary knowledge of the special needs of minors. It may be emphasis or it may be terminology, but the view is that the Bill, as is, is sufficient in that regard. The next amendment is amendment No. 138.

Section 35 provides that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I think that is amendments Nos. 141, 142-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes. Amendment No. 142 affects line 12.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will not accept the amendment because section 35 already deals with these issues.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As Senator Ivana Bacik has outlined, the entire thrust of the Bill is that the best interests of the child or unaccompanied minor is absolutely to the forefront of what we are trying to achieve. I understand the sentiments behind the amendments that were tabled and have no issue with them. However, we have confidence that the Bill is robust in that respect and will serve the best interests of the child or unaccompanied minor in all circumstances. While I appreciate that everybody across the House wants to ensure the Bill is absolutely robust, as has been stated by Senator Ivana Bacik and others, the Bill is framed in that context already. Therefore, individual amendments to underline that fact are not necessary. The Bill does that in its entire form.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am minded that many of these amendments are focused on the status of children. I am not in a position to accept the amendment because the Bill reflects the EU directive where a stateless person is not defined. However, I concur with many of the sentiments that Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh has outlined. The entire composition of the working group that was established to investigate and report back on conditions and the entire nature of direct provision has the rights of children and child welfare at its very heart. In fact, the composition of NGOs and individuals who took part in the working group was central. I will comment on one of the issues that has been outlined by the Senator already, when he spoke about welfare payments that are made to children in direct provision. It is my understanding that the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality are making arrangements to work proactively, in a very short space of time, to ensure the recommendations made in the working group's report on those payments are followed through in very short order. I can appreciate where he is coming from. The idea that a child in the protection system would live in a direct provision centre for years on end is not something we can stand over, and that is the point of this Bill, although there has been criticism of it today.The point is that this issue has been kicked around in these Houses for 12 years or more. A section of the wider Bill has been removed in order to deal with the protection issue.  Senators should be aware that the number of new asylum applications in Ireland is rising again. Applications which numbered in the hundreds in recent years are now in the thousands as a result of the biggest movement of people since the Second World War. The Bill is seeking to change, reform and fix a broken system. The aim is to ensure anyone who seeks protection in this country is dealt with in a speedy and humane fashion. That is the intention of the Bill and children are at the heart of that intention. I concur with the Senator on one point in the context of the referendum that was held in 2004. My party and the Senator's party stood in opposition to that move at the time but the provision is enshrined in the Constitution now and that is the reality of the situation. At that time, the Senator may recall, some of the sentiments expressed were shocking. I remember an Irish-African family were reportedly booed in a polling station when they went to cast their vote. Some of what was said during that referendum campaign, at the height of the boom, was remarkable. It was an unfortunate move on the part of the then Government but in terms of asylum and immigration policy and a collective will to reform this area, no political party in these Houses is standing on an anti-immigration, far-right platform. It is to the credit of this democracy that we do not have the types of debates that are happening in other parts of Europe. We should try to hold onto that and build on it because we cannot be complacent in that regard. These are my comments on the amendment but my commitment to the Senator, in terms of the payments, is that there will be clarity on that matter from the Department of Social Protection very soon.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Again, I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and understand the motivation behind his amendment. However, the technical reality is that children in direct provision are currently in a legal lacuna, as no application for protection can be made on their behalf, but section 15(3) of the Bill addresses that issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I reject that assertion because I have visited approximately 14 direct provision centres and statistics show that since the publication of the working group report, its recommendations are being implemented. The number of asylum applications that have been processed and leave to remain permissions granted has grown by around 60% in that period of time. The recommendations of the report are being implemented. There have been approximately 80 deportation orders revoked since July. The direct provision working group report is being implemented. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh asked for an outline of the number of recommendations being built on within the Bill and I can go through them now if the Senator wishes, although I know we do not have much time left and must deal with many amendments. My commitment to the Senator and this House is that the scandal of direct provision, in terms of the length of time people are living in those centres, will be addressed. The report of the direct provision working group is the only game in town. It is the only document that we are working off. That is the report and it is being implemented.  If the Senator visits the direct provision centres, he will meet families who are getting their papers and who have seen a change in the speed with which the Department operates. An additional €6 million was allocated in the budget to facilitate the recruitment of extra staff to carry out these duties and the statistics show that what we sought to achieve is being achieved. Those who have been more than five years in the direct provision system are having their applications worked on and processed faster. I am glad to see that the rates for people being granted leave to remain have greatly increased and deportation orders have been rescinded in the numbers that I have already outlined. People in direct provision centres know it is happening and I am glad to be part of the process. I am also glad that these Houses have stood up to the plate collectively, as a political entity, to make it happen and it is happening.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They are very different things.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Changed and scrapped are two very different things.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I can speak to amendments Nos. 10, 36, 39, 49 and 215. I will first make some general comments about some of the contributions that have been made. I have to concur with much of what Senator Ivana Bacik said. This legislation is trying to clean up an area of public policy that has robustly failed over quite a prolonged period. We have had a Bill kicking around the place for 12 to 15 years. Finally, we have taken the protection piece out of that legislation in order to ensure new applicants have a more transparent and quicker protection process. The biggest problem with our system has been identified. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh seems to be confusing this Bill with a direct provision Bill. This is not a direct provision Bill. Last week he wanted to abolish direct provision, with no sense of how he was going to house thousands of asylum seekers. He would just leave them go homeless and put them on the housing lists, I suppose, with no provision whatsoever for them. Now he is trying to conflate the two issues again. I stand over absolutely everything I said that the Senator has just quoted back to me, and more. This protection Bill is an effort to ensure we do not have people languishing in direct provision for years on end, or children growing up in it. That is the whole point of the exercise. I will attest to the recommendations of the working group on the protection system, which reported not just on direct provision but on the whole system. That was the whole point of the working group. I hate to remind Senators, but about 4,000 people who are seeking asylum here are not in direct provision. "The early enactment and implementation of a single procedure by way of the International Protection Bill as a matter of urgency" is one recommendation made in the report. Another is: "As an additional safeguard, an annual review of the system with a view to making recommendations to guard against any future backlogs...". Both recommendations are covered in the general aims of the Bill. The report also states: "The review should also look at the option of reducing the five year mark in future years as appropriate." That is in the general aims of the Bill. It also states: "Where the State does not opt-in to an instrument for discrete reasons [...], the State should give full effect to the remaining provisions in order to safeguard important common standards and to promote consistency in the application of protection procedures and standards across the EU". Again, that is in the Bill. "The International Protection Bill 2015 should reflect the general principle contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child"; that is outlined also. "The International Protection Bill should clearly provide that all children have the right to lodge an application for international protection"; that is provided for in sections 14, 15, 34, 35 and 57. "In relation to separated children, work should be undertaken to clarify the position with regard to access to the protection process in practice and age assessment procedures"; that is provided for in sections 14, 24 and 57. I can go on if the Senators wish me to do so. "The International Protection Bill 2015 should be further scrutinised to ensure the rights of the child to be heard are given sufficient expression and protection"; that is provided for in sections 14, 15, 24, 34, 35 and 57. These are all recommendations from the working group report which are dealt with in the Bill. Remarkably, some NGOs and others have contacted me to say the working group report is on a shelf somewhere and is not being implemented. It is the only game and the only document in town. There is no other document or piece of paper from which anybody in the Department, including me and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is working. That is the document we are using to drive though reforms in this area. "The International Protection Bill 2015 should contain a provision requiring decision-makers who take decisions in relation to children and those who interview them to have received and continue to receive appropriate procedural and substantive training"; that is provided for in sections 34 and 35. More of the recommendations are included in sections 15, 34, 35, 47, 57, 61, 62, 64, 72 and so on. Twenty-six of the recommendations are provided for. I might also say some of these recommendations will make other recommendations null and void.This is because if one gets people out of the system within six months, the entire idea of having access to the labour market after nine months will no longer be relevant, because everyone will have gone through the system by then. The entire point of what the Government is trying to achieve with this legislation is to ensure the avoidance of the inhumane reality of people living in centres for years on end. That is the entire point of this protection Bill because, as Members will be aware, the numbers are increasing. That is a fact, not a value judgment. While it used to be the case that Ireland dealt with numbers in the hundreds, it now is dealing with numbers in the thousands. This is simply what is being dealt with and is the way it is. This year, the number should be something greater than 3,500. That is not a value judgment; it is simply a statement of fact. The Government is trying to clean up the system under which there are 34 asylum centres nationwide, and has acknowledged that Ireland must opt into a system from which we previously had an opt-out clause. We must opt in and accept 4,000 refugees into Ireland because that is the humane thing to do, and meanwhile, an increasing number of people are coming here to claim asylum. The Bill will enable the Government to deal with that situation in a much more humane and compassionate fashion than has been the case in the past. I ask the Senator to not confuse the two issues - direct provision and the protection Bill. I am talking about what the Government is trying to do. The assumption is that somehow, within this legislation, the Government can deal with the system of direct provision. The entire point of this legislation is that people can be assessed quickly, humanely and transparently within a short time in order that they are not obliged to spend endless years in direct provision centres. I might also note that it does not matter what conditions are available in direct provision - I absolutely agree they must be robustly changed and improved in many of the centres - because people do not wish to live in them; they want to get a decision on their application. This is what they seek. The last point I will make, because the suggestion was that the Government is somehow keeping from people these recommendations and their effect on the Bill, is that officials from the Department worked on that document over the weekend to ensure it was available for Senators today. The documents were sitting in a pile outside the Chamber when I came in, which some Senators obviously did not notice on their way into the Chamber.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On amendment No. 10-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On amendment No. 10, I unfortunately cannot agree with Senator Jillian van Turnhout’s proposed amendment, which links with the recommendations of the working group. While the recommendation is desirable and I fully support its intent, the working group did not consider the potential impact on other areas of this Bill, including the fact that the Bill refers to the protection process and certain immigration provisions. Following extensive legal advice, I am satisfied the provisions in the Bill both ensure the intent of the recommendations and fulfil the policy of a Government that enabled such a protection to be included in the Constitution, as the Senator mentioned. The Senator’s amendments do not legally satisfy the advices the Government has been given and would have unintended consequences beyond the scope intended, which the Government cannot resolve at this Stage. The Government will continue to explore avenues to reassure all those who rightfully advocate for children’s rights that this Bill will ensure the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in the Irish protection process, ensuring that the best practice followed in our process will be embedded in the practices that result from the enactment of the Bill. While the Government was minded to accept this amendment and wished to so do, the advice of the Attorney General was to the contrary. However, the Government will not leave matters there and will work collectively with the Senator and others to ensure it can go some way towards what Senator Jillian van Turnhout is trying to achieve at a further Stage of the Bill. I cannot agree with amendment No. 36. Accompanied children are in the care of an adult who is taking responsibility for their care and protection, while unaccompanied children are in the care of the Child and Family Agency which has adequate safeguards for the best interests of the child.  I cannot agree with amendment No. 39, as it is appropriate that this legislation provide for the taking of such fingerprints, if necessary, under appropriate supervision. Unfortunately, I cannot agree to the proposed amendment No. 49. The appropriate safeguards in this regard already are in place and if there are doubts with regard to the age of an applicant, the Child and Family Agency is contacted immediately. Members of An Garda Síochána and immigration officers are well trained in this area and can be expected to err on the side of caution in dealing with matters in this regard.  I, unfortunately, cannot agree with amendment No. 215, as to include a general omnibus provision as suggested would amount to partial incorporation in the State of Article 33(1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.This would give rise to potentially discriminatory aspects in respect of Article 8 ECHR decision-making.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Not at all.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator cannot do that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh spoke to the Bill-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator clearly does not understand what he is talking about. I am embarrassed for him.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am embarrassed for him. He does not know what he is talking about.I cannot debate an issue with a Senator who does not know what he is talking about.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator does not have a clue what he is talking about.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is the International Protection Bill. It is not a Bill that deals with the direct provision system. I will try to explain it to the Senator in the simplest possible terms. The direct provision system is one in which a person resides while awaiting a decision. The International Protection Bill is about the system through which the person can get that decision. They are two very separate issues. If the Senator does not understand that then-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment as the Bill already provides for the service of documents to legal representatives where appropriate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is a minor amendment which deals with the revocation of the list of statutory instruments which are part of the existing legal framework for international protection. An additional four statutory instruments are added to the list by the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I totally understand the motivation behind these amendments. I do not, however, agree with them. In respect of amendments Nos. 13 and 14 this section of the Bill is in line with the EU qualifications directive. The list contained in section 7 is not exhaustive. Amendments Nos. 201, 203, 204, 211 and 212 relate to permissions given to family members of qualified persons. The category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available, either by changing his or her residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999. In respect of amendment No. 214 the list contained in this section is not exhaustive. Other forms of violence or abuse will be taken into account when dealing with international protection applications from vulnerable persons. I can appreciate the sentiment behind the amendments but cannot accept them.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will not accept the amendment, although I appreciate the sentiment behind it because the list provided for in the Bill is not exhaustive and is in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Bill is in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive. Whatever is in it, we are in line with. The list as provided for in the Bill is not exhaustive and, therefore, it can be used a defence or a ground for asylum application.It is not listed because having a list of such groups would indicate that any element that was omitted would not be grounds for such an application. The point is that the list in the Bill is not exhaustive, but we are in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are not accepting the amendment, as all applicants are entitled to legal assistance within the meaning of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«These are largely technical and drafting amendments. There are some differences between each one, which I can go through in detail, if Senators require. In general, these amendments are technical in nature and their purpose is more appropriate drafting.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can speak to amendment Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, together?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We cannot accept the proposed amendment as we are concerned that the suggested amendment is too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person not covered in the text of the suggested amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I, unfortunately, cannot accept the proposed amendment. The purpose of this provision is to stop applicants making claims on behalf of their children in their own right after their own cases have been completed, in an effort to frustrate the process and delay their removal from the State.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will not agree to the amendment as a person arriving at the frontier of the State who is an unaccompanied minor will be referred to the Child and Family Agency which will decide what is in his or her best interests. It will make a decision on his or her behalf based on the information and legal advice available to it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have huge sympathy with the amendment as laid down. With all the groups I deal with in regard to my equality brief, be they Travellers, migrants or in the gender equality or LGBT sphere, the issue of work is central to people's sense of self-worth and I agree that we are out of step with international best practice when it comes to allowing asylum seekers access to the labour market. This has led to misinformation and to a misunderstanding within the wider Irish public of the rights and entitlements of those who come to Ireland seeking protection. When they are not seen to be working and actively engaged in the labour market, there is an assumption that they are not willing to work. This is an issue we need to address. Unfortunately, the amendments will not be accepted today because they are linked to recommendations in the working group report. An analysis of the recommendations contained in the report of the working group has been prepared for the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform but no decision has been made on the issue. There are economic and social implications to the provision that extend outside the remit of the Bill, so we are waiting for the Cabinet committee decision on the matter. I understand the Senator's reasons for pushing this amendment and would do the same in his position. However, the issue is not dead, it is for consideration. If we are successful in the implementation of this Bill and if we succeed in bringing about a system where people do not remain in it for more than six months, the recommendations set out in the amendment for access to the labour market within nine months would automatically follow.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will speak to the amendment again. On the one hand, there is a suggestion that we have not done anything while, on the other, there is a suggestion this is being rushed through. As Senators have said, I assumed this position in July 2014. Since then, regardless of the number of visits I have made to individual centres, we made two cast-iron commitments in the statement of Government priorities at the time. One was the enactment of a protection Bill. Time is running out for the Oireachtas. We could easily say we have a range of other things we need to work on and this is something we just have to leave. That would not be the responsible thing to do. I completely accept that people may be frustrated by the length of time and the number of amendments we have to go through on a Monday in the Seanad before the Bill goes to the Dáil. However, as a person with responsibility in this area, I feel keenly that we should do it, take responsibility for it and ensure this Government does it. I hope we will be in a position to form a Government in the next Oireachtas, but I cannot be sure about that. While the Minister and I have responsibility for this area, it is our duty to oversee legislation that will take a much more humane approach to people who come to this land and seek protection. The second point relates to the absolute commitment we made in terms of direct provision. People are again suggesting that the direct provision report on the protection process is on a shelf somewhere. It is being implemented. In respect of the quote that the more conservative recommendations are being implemented-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----we do not have hierarchies of recommendations. We go through recommendations and take every single one of them very seriously and-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are implementing the report and its recommendations.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If Senators want to join me in visiting the centres I visit, they will see the difference that is being made, the percentage of applications that are being processed in a favourable manner, the number of deportation orders that have been quashed and the fact the implementation of the working group's report is being felt in centres throughout the country by people affected by this. There has been a 60% increase in the number of applicants getting leave to remain since July while more than 80 deportation orders have been revoked. The implementation of the working group report is a priority for the Government. It is the only game in town and it would be a derogation of duty if we did not oversee the implementation of the Bill which will ensure we do not have people languishing in centres such as direct provision centres because their applications will be processed in a speedy fashion. On the amendment, I completely accept and understand where Senators are coming from. This is an issue I will pursue, not in the context of the Bill but outside it. I appreciate the sentiments that have been expressed. We are outside the European norm when it comes to workplace rights in terms of those seeking protection in this country. To suggest that by voting down the amendment, we are somehow rejecting the right to work does not stand up.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is more than just this Bill when it comes to the working group's report.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am pre-empting the Senator's-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have a good guess.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In response to Senator David Norris, the rights of the child are implicit and explicit throughout this Bill. As for amendment No. 31, I again revert to the entire point of the Bill, which is that someone who is seeking asylum in this country, be that an asylum seeker or someone seeking protection, will, as a result of the Bill, be in the system for six months. Therefore, all these reasonable issues that have been raised will only be for a relatively short time and not the years and years as in the current position.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Members are giving examples from the current position which is not working, as opposed to the position the Government hopes and expects will work when somebody is in the system for a number of months only. I also note it is very seldom that an applicant is made subject to reporting requirements and there normally is a good reason for this. In practice, An Garda Síochána already takes account of the person's circumstances in this regard.  The Government cannot agree to the Senator's amendment as the existing provision adequately balances the needs of the State and the circumstances of the individual. However, to again underline the point, in the Bill the Government seeks to ensure the avoidance of people spending years in the system. Instead, they will spend six months in the system and, therefore, all those other circumstances being raised by Members will not be as big an issue because the length of time will be reduced greatly.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In effect.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not specified in the Bill that applications will be processed within six months. There is no specific timeline in the Bill but the entire intent of the Bill is to ensure the putting in place of a single procedure to avoid a repeat of what I might suggest is the current chaotic system.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The intent is for six months. I totally accept the Senator's point that the system of direct provision, for example, was supposed to be a six-month holding measure, but it has turned into a long-term solution, if one likes. It is just like how, when rent allowance initially was brought in, it was meant to be an emergency payment for people at risk of homelessness but has turned into a 12 year or 15 year social housing provision. The intent is that a new application will be processed in the first instance within six months and then processed to finality within 12 months. As that is the intent, we no longer will have these six, seven, eight, nine or ten year scenarios. The entire purpose of the Bill is to ensure the provision of a much faster and more transparent process. People have suggested unfairly that the Government's intention is that it will be quicker to deport somebody. As for asylum applications, asylum is a sacred status that is afforded to an individual when given by any country. If a person is awarded asylum status in Ireland or any other country, it is an internationally-recognised sacred status. Consequently, it is not something that is given out lightly. However, in any application process, some people succeed and others do not. That is the system as it will be anywhere in the world and it will be the same system here in Ireland. Some people will be successful and others will not. However, the intention of the Bill is that an application will be processed in the first instance within six months and to finality within 12 months in order that people will not be languishing in a centre or within the system for a prolonged time. I also remind Members that while approximately half of those who seek asylum in Ireland are in direct provision centres, approximately half are not. While Members keep returning again and again to the issue of direct provision, and I understand the issues are linked, it is not central to the Bill, which is dealing with a new application process. Approximately 4,000 of those people are outside the direct provision system in Ireland and, therefore, one must be aware this legislation is for every applicant who comes into Ireland and it will be a much more speedy process, which is what the single procedure is all about.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will not be responding further.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not usual in legislation of this nature to have timelines installed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not what is generally done. That is the whole point of the Bill. There would be no point in having a Bill with a single procedure unless we were trying to speed up the entire process and make the system work an awful lot better. The biggest problem that people come back to us with repeatedly is the length of time. The whole point of this Bill is the length of time; therefore, to suggest we include a definite timeline in the Bill is wrong because that is not how legislation works. The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the length of time issue. Of the 173 recommendations in the working group report, 78 relate to the protection process, 26 of which are dealt with in the Bill, 51 relate to the system of direct provision and 44 relate to other supports. We are implementing the direct provision report on the protection process.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I cannot agree with the Senators’ amendment as all applicants have access to legal assistance within the meaning of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I cannot agree to the proposed changes as section 20 clearly provides for the circumstances in which an applicant can be detained. Section 20(1) states:(a) poses a threat to public security or public order in the State,(b) has committed a serious non-political crime outside the State,(c) has not made reasonable efforts to establish his or her identity,(d) intends to leave the State and without lawful authority enter another state, or(e) without reasonable cause—(i) has destroyed his or her identity or travel document, or(ii) is or has been in possession of a forged, altered or substituted identity document.The section makes it clear that a person cannot be detained for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant for international protection. Specific reasons are laid out in section 20 on page 22, as I have outlined. A person cannot be arrested for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant for protection. It is not provided for in the Bill, nor should it be.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The garda or immigration officer has to comply with one of the reasons as stated in the Bill. The very suggestion somebody would be arrested for the sole reason of seeking asylum is preposterous.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is the determination that we give the garda to make a reasonable case in that regard.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In all these cases, gardaí will have to show reasonable cause. This is what happens in all these instances. They cannot arrest somebody without reasonable cause whereby one of the listed criteria is met. Without reasonable cause, they would be outside the remit of the Bill. They have to establish reasonable cause.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With regard to amendment No. 42, I cannot agree to the deletion of the reference to “arrest without warrant” at the start of section 20. This is a necessary first step and provision is also made for a person having been so detained to be brought before the District Court as soon as is practicable. The court would have to be satisfied as to the justification of the detention. I cannot agree to amendment No. 43. The use of the words “him or her” is fine in this instance and avoids repetition.I cannot agree to the proposed amendment to section 20.  In respect of amendment No. 44, I cannot agree to the removal of the words “altered or substituted” or to the removal of the words “or substituted” from section 20(1)(e) as suggested in Senator O'Donovan’s amendment No. 45. These issues that can arise in the context of travel documentation need to be comprehended by the Bill. I could continue but essentially I am not agreeing to amendments Nos. 46 and 47.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is a minor amendment to subsection (14) to effectively replace the term "solicitor" with the term "legal representative". The term "legal representative" is preferred because it is defined in the interpretation section of the Bill as meaning a practising solicitor or barrister.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is unavoidably detained on other important business.  The Bill aims to tackle persistent offenders charged with multiple offences of burglary of homes. It will enhance the provisions for refusal of bail in appropriate cases and provide for consecutive sentencing for repeat offenders. Burglary is an invasive upsetting crime which is not simply about theft or property. When it occurs in the home it strikes at our peace of mind in the one place where we should feel most secure. Article 40.5 of the Constitution highlights the importance of the home, "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law". The courts have long recognised that the burglary of a person's home is an egregious crime. In his judgment in the 2006 case of DPP v. Barnes, Mr. Justice Hardiman stated, "The offence of burglary committed in a dwellinghouse is in every instance an act of aggression, an attack on the personal rights of the citizen as well as a public crime and is a violation of him or her." On account of her concern about a rise in the number of domestic burglaries, the Minister initiated a review of the response of the criminal justice system to the problem. The review examined legislation, the management of prolific offenders, policing and crime prevention. It involved the Garda Commissioner, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service. The Minister has been consistent in her view that serious and serial offenders must continue to be imprisoned in appropriate cases. Public safety is of paramount importance. However, it is equally clear that imprisonment is only part of the solution. Locking people up and forgetting about them is not an effective way to reduce reoffending or protect communities and reduce victimisation. The review highlighted the fact that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Senators will be aware that approximately 25% of offenders are responsible for 75% of property offences. There is also evidence of a high rate of recidivism for burglary. Data from the 2013 Irish Prison Service recidivism study shows a rate of over 79% among persons imprisoned for burglary and related offences. Data from the 2008 to 2013 Probation Service recidivism study shows a recidivism rate of 49% among persons engaging with the Probation Service for burglary and related offences. These are the highest rates for any offence group. Offenders pass through the hands of the Garda, the courts, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service. The criminal justice system cannot be effective if it is disjointed. The Minister is keen to ensure it handles offenders in a co-ordinated way from beginning to end. Last week the Minister launched the joint agency response to crime initiative, JARC, an inter-agency response to the management and rehabilitation of offenders. It involves the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service and An Garda Síochána working in collaboration with statutory, community and voluntary partners. The JARC strategy aims to target those recidivist offenders responsible for the majority of crime. To reduce crime and enhance public safety, the nominated prolific offenders will be managed through the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research between the organisations. It makes sense that by targeting identified prolific offenders with such cross-cutting initiatives, which address their criminal behaviour and the harm it does, crime will be reduced and public safety increased. The people concerned require a specific programme in the community if they are to make better choices. In this context, targeting the relatively small group of repeat burglars has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of burglary and the harm it causes throughout the country.In addition to a more co-ordinated approach to offender management, the review I referred to identified two key problems which can be tackled by legislation. One relates to repeat offenders who are granted bail despite being charged with multiple burglaries and who often commit further burglaries while on bail. The other relates to the fact that relatively short sentences can be imposed by the courts when multiple burglary offences are taken into account. This Bill will address these problems. Of course, before one can prosecute or manage offenders, one has to respond to burglaries and investigate them. Tackling crime and burglaries remains a top priority for the Government and An Garda Síochána. Operation Thor, a new multi-strand, national, anti-crime and anti-burglary operation was recently launched by the Garda Commissioner. An extra allocation of more than €5 million has been committed by the Government to support Operation Thor, which entails a broad range of activities to tackle crime, particularly burglaries, in urban and rural communities nationwide. These include additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of high-powered vehicles by the armed regional response units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce reoffending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign; targeted crime prevention advice for local communities; and enhanced supports for victims. Since Operation Thor commenced last month, there has been a range of arrests and persons have been charged as part of planned operations. These include arrests in Dublin, Dundalk, Cavan, Dunboyne, Mullingar and Birr, as well as a large-scale search of 12 locations in the Limerick area as part of a targeted operation against organised crime groups in which drugs and firearms were also seized. The Minister expects to receive ongoing reports on the impact of the operation throughout the country. Special targeted patrols have been implemented with the assistance of Garda national support services against criminal groups. These arrangements have also targeted the use of motorways by criminal gangs and have contributed to the arrest of a number of high-priority suspects. It is also important to note that the sustained Garda response under the previous Operation Fiacla has produced many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminal activity. As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 persons charged. The everyday tasks of An Garda Síochána and the specialist operations all have to be resourced. The Government has prioritised investment in the Garda and all aspects of its work. More than €34 million has been invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with more than 640 new vehicles coming onstream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. The Government's capital plan for 2016 to 2021 provides for a further €46 million of investment in vehicles, as well as the recently authorised allocation of €1.8 million for the replacement and upgrade of equipment on the Garda fixed-wing aircraft. The capital plan contains an additional €205 million for Garda ICT systems and technology. This will bring overall Garda ICT funding to €330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan. A few weeks ago, the Minister, together with the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, Deputy Simon Harris, announced details of the Garda building and refurbishment programme, which includes more than €60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the Government capital plan for 2016 to 2021, as well as a major public private partnership project. Last month the Minister commenced the DNA legislation that saw the launch of a new state-of-the-art DNA database system, based in Forensic Science Ireland in the Phoenix Park. The DNA database represents a significant development in assisting An Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime. This high-quality intelligence and investigation tool will be invaluable in the fight against a whole range of crimes, including burglary. The most important resources the Commissioner has at her disposal are the members of the force whom I commend for their brave, compassionate and dedicated service, none more so than Garda Tony Golden who went far beyond the call of duty and gave his life to protect a vulnerable victim of domestic violence. He, with the 87 other members of the force who have given their lives in the line of duty, did so out of a sense of service, a vocation to care for and protect their fellow citizens. There are no words of sorrow or gratitude equal to that service and sacrifice. We can, as legislators and a Government, show our support for the members of An Garda Síochána in a practical way by giving them the resources they need to do their work. I have spoken already of the investment in vehicles, equipment, buildings and technology being made by the Government. The Bill we are debating will be a valuable legislative tool for gardaí in their work to tackle burglary. We also need to address Garda numbers. The Garda College in Templemore was reopened to new recruits in September 2014. Six intakes of new Garda trainees have since entered the Garda College, giving a total intake of 550 recruits. Of these, 295 have already attested and are now working in communities nationwide. The Minister recently announced the opening of a recruitment campaign for new members of An Garda Síochána in 2016. This new campaign underscores the Government's commitment to seamless ongoing recruitment to An Garda Síochána to ensure the service is renewed and has the capacity to deliver an effective, responsive police service throughout the country to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends. This additional recruitment will bring to 1,150 the total number of Garda trainees recruited under the Government between September 2014 and 2016. The 2016 campaign will include a special stream for eligible members of the Garda Reserve who give their time on a voluntary basis to support the work of An Garda Síochána. Community-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Neighbourhood Watch and Muintir na Tíre are key partners of An Garda Síochána in the fight against rural crime. Part of Operation Thor is to raise awareness in the community as to how they can work together to prevent crime. The funding being provided to support community alert and Crimestoppers is being doubled, with a total allocation of €397,000 in 2016. I will now outline the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 seeks to ensure prolific burglars can be refused bail in appropriate cases. It is necessary to recall that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proved guilty. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 which gave effect to the 16th amendment of the Constitution permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. Burglary offences are designated as serious offences for the purposes of the Bail Act. However, it is clear that prolific burglars with numerous previous convictions are repeatedly granted bail, despite Garda objections, even when charged with a series of burglaries. Section 1 will add new provisions to section 2 of the Bail Act 1997. The new provisions will apply where a court is considering a bail application from an adult charged with a relevant offence alleged to have been committed in a dwelling. A relevant offence is defined as a burglary or aggravated burglary offence contrary to section 12 or 13 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, respectively. For the purposes of bail applications in such cases, the court must consider previous convictions for domestic burglary, coupled with pending charges or recent convictions as evidence that the accused person is likely to commit a further domestic burglary. Turning to the detail of the provisions, the new subsection (2A) applies where a court is deciding whether it is reasonably considered necessary to refuse bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence by a person who is charged with a burglary alleged to have been committed in a dwelling. In such a case, if there are certain circumstances, as set out in subsection (2B), the court must consider the existence of these circumstances as evidence that the person is likely to commit a further domestic burglary. These circumstances are that the person has a previous conviction for domestic burglary committed in the five years before the bail application and that the person has been convicted of at least two domestic burglaries committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the alleged commission of the offence for which he or she is seeking bail, the person has been charged with at least two domestic burglaries allegedly committed in the same period, or the person has been convicted of at least one domestic burglary committed, and charged with at least one other domestic burglary allegedly committed, in the same period. The provisions, while making it clear that prolific burglars should be refused bail in the circumstances set out in the Bill, will leave the courts all necessary discretion to vindicate the constitutional rights of an accused person in relation to bail. The new subsection (2C) provides that a reference in subsection (2B) to a conviction for a relevant offence includes a conviction that is under appeal. The new subsection (2D) provides that subsection (2B) will not prejudice the operation of section 258 of the Children Act 2001 which provides for the non-disclosure of certain findings of guilt relating to offences committed by persons under the age of 18 years. A new subsection (4) will be inserted into section 2 of the Bail Act to define "dwelling" and "relevant offence" for the purposes of the new provisions. Section 2 seeks to deal with the related problem of concurrent sentences being handed down for multiple burglaries. In many cases, relatively short sentences are imposed when multiple burglary offences are taken into account by the court. Section 2 will insert a new section 54A into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. The new section will require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively. The new section applies only to a relevant offence, which means a burglary or aggravated burglary. The provisions will apply only to adults previously convicted of a domestic burglary committed in the five years before the burglary offence for they are being sentenced. Subsection (1) of the new section 54A will apply where an adult is being sentenced to imprisonment for a domestic burglary, was convicted of another domestic burglary committed in the five years before the offence for which he or she is being sentenced and was sentenced to imprisonment for another domestic burglary committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the burglary offence for which he or she is now being sentenced.In such a case, any sentence of imprisonment which the court chooses to impose for the burglary for which the person is being sentenced must be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment imposed for the prior domestic burglary offences. Subsection (2) makes it clear that where a prior burglary offence would come within paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1), that offence may be considered for the purpose of satisfying either paragraph (b) or (c) but not both. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply only where the burglary offence for which the person is being sentenced was committed after the Bill comes into operation and will apply whether the other offences were committed before or after that date. Subsection (4) provides that the aggregate term of imprisonment for consecutive sentences imposed by the District Court under the new provisions can extend to but not exceed two years. No such restriction will apply to the Circuit Court. Subsection (5) provides that a reference in subsection (1) to a conviction for a relevant offence includes a conviction that is under appeal. Subsection (6) defines "dwelling" and "relevant offence" for the purposes of the new section. The discretion of a court whether to impose a custodial sentence will not be restricted by the new provisions. Section 3 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill. The Bill targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat offending. It is one part of a broader co-ordinated strategy to tackle burglary and other crime through investment in Garda resources, increased recruitment, specialist operations such as Operation Thor, co-ordinated offender management through the joint agency response to crime, JARC, investment in community initiatives like text alert and investment in crime fighting technology, including the DNA database. The key objective of the legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others. I commend the Bill to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the contributions made across the House and the support for the Bill. I listened with interest to what Senators had to say and thank all those who contributed to the debate. It is clear that all of us here are of the view that burglary is an odious offence, particularly when it interferes with what should be the peaceful haven of a person's home. In tackling burglaries, the Government is particularly focused on serious and repeat offenders in terms of sentencing and in smarter and more co-ordinated offender management and investing in the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle such offenders.  The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, commissioned a review of this area earlier in the year and the Bill is directly informed by the concerns identified by An Garda Síochána. Officials from the Department met the detectives tackling burglaries so that they could hear first hand the difficulties they face to identify the improvements in the law which have been delivered in the Bill. Gardaí noted the particular challenges they face in tackling repeat offenders who obtain bail, despite having multiple convictions or facing multiple charges. Such offenders often commit many burglaries while on bail and then push to receive a sentence for as few offences as possible while having many more taken into consideration. The Bill addresses both ends of the problem.  The constitutional right of liberty of accused persons is carefully balanced with the constitutional right to inviolable dwelling. Multiple offences of domestic burglary or multiple pending charges or a combination of both will be considered as evidence that the person is likely to commit further domestic burglary. The courts will be empowered to deny bail to such prolific offenders in appropriate cases.  As regards sentencing, multiple offences committed within the same 12-month period cannot simply be taken into consideration or rolled up into a single concurrent sentence of imprisonment. If a court is minded to impose a sentence of imprisonment it would be obliged to impose it consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment for domestic burglary committed within the same 12-month period.  Work is progressing on the drafting of a new bail Bill which the Minister intends to bring forward as a matter of priority to strengthen other aspects of the law and to protect the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. Legislation is only part of the solution. Results on the ground are delivered by the men and women of An Garda Síochána. Gardaí ensure our laws are enforced and that the rights of vulnerable victims are upheld. It is important that we equip the gardaí to do their jobs. I wish to outline the significant investment the Government is making in Garda equipment, ICT, vehicles, buildings and the new DNA database. The Government's capital plan is providing a major investment in 21st century policing to tackle crime. An additional €46 million has been provided for vehicles, €60 million for buildings and overall ICT funding of €330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan. The Minister secured an extra allocation for the recruitment of 600 new gardaí. I have already mentioned the effect of Operation Thor. I listened with particular interest to the concerns of all Members of the House to particular cases mentioned by colleagues. I sympathise with all victims of burglaries. In addition to resourcing An Garda Síochána to tackle the offenders, we are putting in place supports for victims. The general scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill has been published and the Bill is being drafted. Victims of crime will be placed at the heart of the justice system for the first time. Victims will have a right to receive clear information on the criminal justice system, their role within it and the range of services and entitlements they may access. The Bill provides the right to receive written acknowledgement of the making of a complaint as well as details on how further information can be obtained. Victims will be able to request information concerning the progress of the investigation in any court proceedings. The information must be provided by a prison service on the release and escape from prison of an offender serving a sentence for an offence against the victim if requested. Victims will also have the right to individual assessment of the measures necessary for their protection from further victimisation. An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service and the Garda Ombudsman Commission will all be obliged to train staff members in the needs of victims and to enable them to deal with victims in a respectful and professional manner. On the closure of Garda stations, policing has a lot more complexity to it than where a station is located. Recent statistics show no correlation between station closures and a rise in burglary. The number of burglaries has, in fact, fallen in some areas where stations were closed. I understand the concern expressed at the closure of Garda stations. It can appear that resources have been withdrawn from an area when this happens, but that is not the truth. The closure of Garda stations was not about saving money. It was done to enhance service delivery and efficiency. We have heard again in recent days from the Garda association and the Garda Inspectorate about the need to release gardaí from paperwork for front line duties. The rationalisation programme put in place by Garda management shows front-line gardaí to be deployed with greater mobility and flexibility, particularly for targeted police operations. As a result, communities benefit from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which improves the police service to the public. The network of more than 700 Garda stations inherited from the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police reflected a 19th century model that predated the invention of the motor car. Can anyone seriously argue that a 19th century policing model should be applied to 21st century crime? The Garda strategy which the Minister supports and has resourced is to ensure a dynamic policing response that has enabled it to tackle crime where and when it happens and the appropriate equipment. The Garda cannot drive a desk to a scene of a crime to apprehend criminals or move that desk to the other side of the county in response to changing crime patterns. However, a garda in a patrol car or a high-powered response vehicle can both engage with the local community and attend the scene of a crime. We must support a 21st century model of policing.  On the issue of tagging, the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring as a condition of bail at the discretion of the court. However, due to issues relating to the operational effectiveness of untargeted electronic monitoring, these provisions have not been commenced. Evidence in other jurisdictions has shown that electronic monitoring has significant limitations. For example, the report on the Scottish electronic monitoring has a condition of bail where neither the aims of increasing public safety perceptions nor reducing the custodial remand population have been achieved in any significant way.  I thank Members for their support for the Bill. The Bill was developed, having sought the advice of gardaí on the ground and in the light of the challenges they face. It represents a targeted response to those who think they can repeatedly burgle the homes of innocent victims with impunity. Suggestions that people's right to free legal aid should be curtailed are not consistent with the values of a republic. One may not like it and we may find it difficult to accept, but if we believe in living in a free and open democracy and in a republic, there are certain rights and entitlements that go with living in that republic. It is a constitutional right.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It represents in this Bill, a short Bill, a technically complex Bill which carefully balances constitutional rights to ensure the Garda and the courts can respond fairly but effectively to the crime caused by prolific burglars. This legislation, together with Operation Thor and the joint agency response to crime, is focused on tackling and managing prolific offenders. It forms part of a comprehensive package aimed at reducing the scourge of crime and burglaries, in particular. There is a wider debate to be had about the root causes of crime and issues of inequality in that respect, but that is for another day.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I thank Senator Sean D. Barrett for bringing forward this amendment. It arose from an interesting point he made on Second Stage regarding the appropriateness of attaching the name "St. Patrick's" to a place where young persons were detained in view of the circumstances under which St. Patrick had been reputedly brought to Ireland and subjected to forced labour. Senators will appreciate the Government is fully committed to and will very shortly achieve, finally, the closing of St. Patrick's Institution. Accordingly, it is now a matter of when, rather than if, St. Patrick's Institution will be closed. Subsequently, there will be an end to the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities. While recommending in 2013 that St. Patrick's Institution be closed, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention also recommended that the name "St. Patrick's" be consigned to history. The Bill will do this by providing not only for the complete closing of St. Patrick's Institution but also through the general removal of references to St. Patrick's Institution from the Statute Book. In particular, the Bill will repeal all the legislative provisions that specifically enable the courts to order the detention of young persons in St. Patrick's Institution. The term "place of detention" has a specific meaning in prisons legislation. Section 2 of the Prisons Act 1970 provides that the Minister for Justice may, for the purposes of promoting the rehabilitation of offenders, provide places other than prisons for the detention of sentenced persons. These places are known and referred to as "places of detention". Wheatfield Place of Detention, as it is now called, is one such place. Therefore, the Senator's amendment would not prevent a children's detention school or prison from being given the name "St. Patrick's". More generally, I imagine Senators understand the attachment of the name "St. Patrick's Institution" to the premises which is the subject of the Bill was of its time and would not happen today. In the circumstances, while she fully appreciates the sentiments behind the proposed amendment, the Minister does not believe it is necessary or that it should be included in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«We are making a little history today. I thank all of the Members who contributed to the debate on the Bill. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I are grateful for the support of Senators for the proposals contained in the Bill. The Prisons Bill finally delivers on the calls to close St. Patrick's Institution which have been made for the past 30 years. The Government's unprecedented programme of reform in closing St. Patrick's Institution and developing national children detention facilities at Oberstown will allow young people sentenced to detention to be placed in a secure environment that will offer them a better chance, as stated in the Children Act 2001, to take their place in the community as persons who observe the law and are capable of making a positive and productive contribution to society. Before concluding, I advise the House that the Minister intends to table amendments to the Bill in the Dáil to provide for two further matters. The amendments are linked with High Court proceedings in connection with prison-related matters. Unfortunately, it was not possible for the drafting of the amendments to be completed in time for their inclusion in the Bill, as published, or for them to be tabled on Committee Stage. The first arises from the judgment of the High Court earlier this year in the case of Mr. O v. the Minister for Justice and Equality. In that case the High Court considered the legality of the temporary release of a prisoner who had been subject to a deportation order and deported immediately after his release from prison. The High Court decided that section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, which governs the temporary release of prisoners, did not permit the temporary release of prisoners who were subject to deportation orders for the purposes of their deportation or removal from the State. Given the practical implications of the Mr. O judgment for the deportation process, the Minister believes a clear legislative basis is needed to allow non-national prisoners to be taken from prison by members of An Garda Síochána or immigration officers for the purposes of giving effect to deportation orders under the Immigration Act 1999 or removal orders under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. She, therefore, proposes to bring forward an amendment to make new and specific provision for this purpose. Second, arising from an issue that has emerged in recent High Court proceedings, the Minister considers it appropriate to bring forward a technical amendment relating to warrants issued by courts in Dublin for the committal of persons to prison. Dublin District Court committal warrants are addressed to An Garda Síochána in accordance with the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851. However, District Court Rules permit committal warrants in Dublin to be addressed directly to the governor of the prison to which a person is to be committed. It has always been thought that this was permitted under the 1851 Act and the courts have operated on that basis. However, in a judgment in the recent case of Grant v. Governor of Cloverhill Prison the High Court judge expressed the view that the relevant provision of the District Court Rules might be inconsistent with the 1851 Act. As this opens up the prospect of uncertainty in the legal position, the Minister proposes to table an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil to declare that the committal warrant issued by the District Court in Dublin can be addressed to the governor of a prison. This is the position that has been taken to apply in Dublin for many years. The Prisons Bill is expected to complete all Stages in the Dáil on Monday and I understand arrangements will be made for the Bill to be returned to this House later next week in order that it can complete its passage through both Houses and be signed into law by the end of the year.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«The purpose of the proposed new sections is to amend the law relating to judicial appointments but with only one dimension of the law considered, that is, making legal academics eligible for appointment as judges of all courts by extending to them the qualifying and eligibility provisions which currently apply to practising barristers and solicitors. Effectively, the amendments would equate a legal academic with barristers and solicitors who, subject to having the relevant practice experience, are eligible for appointment to all courts. The first amendment defines a "qualifying legal academic" as a member of the academic staff at the King's Inns, the Law Society, universities and other legal training institutions. The second amendment would make such legal academics eligible for appointment to the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. The third amendment would make them eligible for appointment as temporary judges. The fourth would make them eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court; the fifth would make the same provision in respect of the District Court, while the sixth would have the effect of including such legal academics among those whom the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board may consider suitable as persons whose names could be submitted by it to the Minister under the appointments procedures set out under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. The amendments, given that they deal with appointments as judges, are outside the scope of the Bill. The Government is conducting a wide-ranging review of all matters concerned with judicial appointments that will allow the necessary full assessment of all aspects of the issue. It is committed to bringing forward legislative reforms in this area and a judicial appointments Bill which is being prepared is the subject of a commitment in the agreed programme for Government. The subject of the amendments, that is, the eligibility of legal academics for judicial appointment, is one of a wide range of matters included within the scope of the review I have mentioned.Legislation in this area that might have regard to only one aspect of eligibility for judicial appointment is unlikely to complement the overall reform process needed in the area which is balanced and considered and which, as I have mentioned, the Government proposes to bring forward as soon as practicable. The question of appointing academic lawyers is not new. From time to time, calls have been made to tap into the deep academic experience and knowledge of professors of law and similar. Often, these are persons with a great level of expertise in particular areas of the law or who research the law extensively. They teach the subject and, in some cases, they have authored legal texts and engaged in public discourse on matters relating to the law. I am confident the merits or otherwise of such a measure will be fully explored in the context of the judicial appointments review I have mentioned. It was understood on launching the review and the public consultations that it would be worthwhile to consider opening up the eligibility criteria for appointment as a judge, perhaps in so far as the experience of academic lawyers is concerned, but perhaps also to reflect the depth of experience in other areas where great legal expertise is evident without the required practice experience. The consultation process last year reflected the fact the appointments system, including the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, while a model of best practice in its day needed reviewing almost 20 years after its establishment. Arising from the consultation process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update the judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by the Department as such legislation is part of the agreed programme for Government. The Minister has indicated that reforms will be brought forward in 2016. On this basis I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment in favour of fully comprehensive reform of the law in the area of judicial appointments as the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. I undertake to refer the Senator's amendment to the Department for inclusion as a matter for consideration in the work of the review I have mentioned.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My understanding of the amendment is that its desired effect is to standardise the retirement age of District Court judges with all other judges to a fixed retirement age of 70 years. I have been informed the Minister has been in consultation with the Judiciary on this matter and agrees the retirement age of District Court judges should be raised to 70 years, but I do not believe the amendment would achieve this or that any such amendment should be inserted in the Courts Bill 2015. The position is that District Court judges are required to retire at 65 years of age and may, subject to annual review, be permitted to serve until age 70. Supreme Court judges, Court of Appeal judges, High Court judges and Circuit Court judges retire at the age of 70 years with some exceptions. These exceptions relate only to those serving judges who were judges before the reduction of the age of retirement from 72 years to 70 under the Court and Court Officers Act 1995. The relevant provisions include section 30 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 which provides that the age of retirement of a District Court judge shall be 65 years. Section 2 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1949 provides that a warrant may be made by a committee comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General to allow a judge to continue in office for an additional year if the judge is not suffering from any disability which would render him or her unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of the office. Subsequent warrants may be made to allow the judge to remain in office until he or she attains the age of 70 years. The Minister is inclined to agree that an annual review system for District Court judges between the ages of 65 and 70 years is, when compared to other judges, anomalous and unsatisfactory. There are no grounds for believing that all judges should not be subject to the same retirement regime. To this end, I have been informed that the Minister has instructed the Department to review the relevant statutory provisions and bring forward a comprehensive amendment at the earliest possible opportunity. I anticipate such provision can be brought forward early in 2016. Changing the retirement age to 70 years would require amending the sections I have mentioned. Amendment of other provisions may also be required, for example, to section 1 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1988. This section makes provision for warrants to be made retrospectively. Additional provisions also require consideration. There would be implications for the pension arrangements of judges arising from a change in the retirement age which would need to be carefully considered and the relevant scheme and pensions legislation are being considered. In this connection, I would be most reluctant to bring forward or accept any amendments in this area until all of the implications are fully assessed. As I have indicated, I anticipate this work, which is at an advanced stage, will be concluded in the near future. Section 72 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 was repealed by the provisions of the Court of Justice (District Court) Act 1946 which was, in turn, repealed and replaced by the provisions to which I have referred in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961. Apart from the technical difficulties to which the amendment gives rise and the fact the subject matter of the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill, the overriding position is that the substantive issue which the amendment seeks to address is the subject of review by the Department and relevant comprehensive measures are being prepared, while the administrative implications, for example, on pension matters are also being examined. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment on the basis that its intention can be fully reflected in a comprehensive fully analysed set of provisions which, as I indicated, are in preparation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As has been stated, the principle behind the amendment is accepted; it is just the mechanisms around it on which we may be in disagreement. I am informed the review is due to move forward in the early part of 2016.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The desired effect of the amendment is to provide for the eligibility of District Court judges for appointment to the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. I have been informed that the Minister has been in consultation with the Judiciary on this matter and is inclined to agree that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment beyond the Circuit Court. However, this is not an appropriate amendment and no such amendment should be inserted in the Courts Bill. Dealing with the District Court judge promotion question without more broadly addressing arguably equally pressing judicial appointments issues, as the Government is committed to doing under the agreed programme for Government, would be an unwise step. The Minister's preferred approach is to defer the issue for consideration in the context of wider reform of the law on appointments, a matter to which I will return. Section 5(2)(a) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as inserted by section 4 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 and relevant amendments in the Court of Appeal Act 2014, provides that a person shall be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court if he or she is, for the time being, a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than 12 years standing who has practised as a barrister or solicitor for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately before such appointment. Section 5(2)(c) of the 1961 Act provides that a judge of the Circuit Court who has served as a judge for a period of not less than two years should be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court. Therefore, such a judge is not precluded from consideration by the requirement that the person be a practising barrister or solicitor at the time of appointment to the higher courts. As there is no provision equivalent to section 5(2)(c) in respect of District Court judges, they cannot qualify for appointment to the higher courts as they were not considered to be practising at the time of appointment. A similar provision would, therefore, be required to make District Court judges eligible for appointment to courts higher than the Circuit Court. Transitional provisions and other consequential amendments may also be required.  I am aware that the Judiciary is of the view that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the High Court. As I have indicated, the Minister agrees with this view and careful consideration needs to be given to the question of whether District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. Judges of certain European and international courts are also eligible for appointment to the superior courts. For example, a person who, during the period of two years immediately before the appointment concerned, was a judge of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is eligible for appointment to the High Court or the Supreme Court. This provision also applies to a judge of the European Court of Human Rights, the International Criminal Court and certain other European and international courts.  The Minister accepts that there appears to be no good reason that, of all the various categories of judges, the only group specifically excluded from the possibility of appointment as a judge of the High Court or above are District Court judges. She has asked her Department to prepare relevant provisions to make District Court judges eligible for elevation to courts higher than the Circuit Court. However, this is being done in the context of a full, ongoing review of the entire system of judicial appointments. The Government is committed to introducing legislative reforms in this area and a judicial appointments Bill which is being prepared is a commitment in the agreed programme for Government.  The subject matter of the amendments, namely, the eligibility of District Court judges for judicial appointment, is one of a wide range of matters included in the scope of the review to which I referred. As part of this review, a consultation process on the system of judicial appointments was conducted in early 2014. There was a significant response to the call for submissions, with substantive and wide-ranging views received on the legislative framework that provides for eligibility for judicial appointments and the process of appointments. Legislation in this area which may have regard to only one aspect of eligibility for judicial appointments is unlikely to complement the overall reform process required in this area which must be balanced and considered and which, as I stated, the Government proposes to introduce as soon as is practical. On this basis, I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendment in favour of a fully comprehensive reform of the law in the area of judicial appointments which will include changes in the eligibility conditions for serving District Court judges. The amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. The position is similar to that on the previous amendment in that while it is sound in principle, the issue as stake is the mechanism by which the objective is to be achieved.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senators for their contributions. The issue at hand is agreed and the principle behind the amendment is accepted, but it is a question of how we achieve what is proposed. A judicial appointments Bill is being prepared and due to be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas early in 2016. That is the vehicle by which we feel this issue might best be addressed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am told it will be ready early in 2016, which is when the Bill to which I have referred will be introduced.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am informed it is at an advanced stage. It must be presented to the Government in the form of a scheme of a Bill. Early 2016 is still my response.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senators for their comments. When debating the Bill, we all are united in our attempts to tackle this most heinous of crimes. The Senator refers to explicit material. There is a deliberate attempt among commercial enterprises to sexualise young people and children, to shorten their childhood and to make them aware of their sexual power above any other power. It is quite disturbing. It is something that must be addressed because it is completely disempowering and is warping the young minds of boys and girls as early as possible for commercial benefit in the "legitimate" commercial and corporate sphere. This is something we may be able to return to between now and Report Stage because I am taken by the comments that have been made. I will give the technical response, but perhaps this is something on which we can work. The effect of the amendments would be to substitute the term "child sexual abuse material" for "child pornography" throughout this Bill and other Acts in which it appears. As the Senator will be aware, the language used in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and this Bill reflects that contained in the EU directive to which the Bill, among other matters, is giving effect, as well as the Council of Europe Convention on Child Sexual Exploitation. It is also a term used in other EU instruments, including the Council decision to establish Europol. The amendments are proposed on the basis that the term "child sexual abuse material" more accurately reflects the horrific abuse involved and avoids the idea of some form of consent which may be implicit in the term "pornography". In terms of the wording of the amendments put forward, there is a technical difficulty, which means that I would be unable to accept them. The term "child pornography" appears in the Statute Book outside the 1998 Act and any general amendment to that term throughout the Statute Book should be carefully made. I am advised that a general amending provision, as proposed by the Senator in amendment No. 25, would not suffice. Rather each provision in the Statute Book containing the term which it is proposed to amend should be individually identified. While it is not unusual to amend one form of words with another, it is done through individual identification of each instance. This is an important safeguard, particularly where the provisions relate to the criminal law. The amendments proposed also raise other technical difficulties such as the effect on the Short Title of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. I am advised it is not appropriate to amend the Short Title of an existing Act by an amendment in subsequent legislation. The Act should be substituted and repealed. For these reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment on this occasion. The Minister would, however, fully support including the Senator's proposal in any future review of child pornography legislation. It is a technical reason. Perhaps we might look again to see if we can overcome this technical matter because the language the Senator has proposed is stronger and most likely to be more appropriate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to allow the court to impose a fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment on a person who is convicted on indictment of an offence under this section. A fine is already available as a penalty or part thereof for summary convictions under this section but was omitted in respect of convictions on indictment. It is unusual to provide for both a fine and a term of imprisonment in the available penalties, particularly where financial gain may be a motivation in the offence. This is consistent with the framing of other penalty provisions contained in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is standard legal practice, it is not unusual. To not do it would be an anomaly. The amendment is a standard framing of penalties in the State. A range of penalties are available for offences in the Bill and it is a standard in the drafting of penalties for offences. It is not in any way to suggest a fine in this area is an appropriate sentence, it is just the way that legislation in the State is framed across the Statute Book in every single circumstance. Reference was made to the report of the Garda Inspectorate.
The office of Internet safety within the Department provides a hotline service for the reporting of crime and the Minister has completely accepted the report and is examining it in detail. The prosecuting of child pornography is a technically difficult type of investigation which can involve different jurisdictions, unnamed people and unnamed vulnerable victims. As it is Internet based, it is particularly difficult to prosecute. However, there have been a number of recent sexual exploitation cases which were successfully prosecuted. It is given the highest priority, but in order to execute a conviction one must have a proper, robust investigation. Unfortunately, that can take time because of the complex nature of the offence.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«To clarify one matter, I do not live in the leafy suburbs but in Ballybough, an area that has leaves.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes, although my house is not as big as the Senator's.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not wish to diminish the seriousness of the topic we are discussing. On the issue of fines and mandatory prison sentences, mandatory imprisonment is limited to a small number of offences, namely, certain drugs and firearms offences. The sexual exploitation of a child is addressed in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and carries a penalty of a life sentence. We are dealing today with an offence that is in part financially motivated. Therefore, the addition of a fine, as provided for in the amendment, is appropriate. It should be noted, however, that the amendment has been passed.It is a worthy debate, but we have work to do.  In terms of the sections, as outlined by Senator David Norris and on the apparent discrepancy in the definition of what constitutes a child, these are technical issues and relate to international law. Section 3 is an EU directive requirement and, therefore, the age is 18 years. Section 4 is a passive form of sexual assault and the age below which one cannot consent to an act which may amount to sexual assault is 15 years. Section 5 stipulates 17 years which reflects the age of consent in national law generally.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I refer Senators to the comments I made previously. If further clarification is required on the issue of additional fines and imprisonment, we will be happy to provide it on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We can examine it in the context of providing clarification and I have no difficulty doing so. As Senators stated, the definition is a sensitive issue. It is also a difficult one because different instances require different responses. In order to ensure clarity, we have no difficult in doing, as I have outlined.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The amendment has been passed.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The amendment has been passed and the justification for the amendment has been given. I have given an undertaking on the language provided in respect of the uncertainty of some Senators on the question of fines versus imprisonment, as well as in respect of the definition of a child. We are happy to return to this issue on Report Stage to allay whatever fears Senators have.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue in respect of age of consent is addressed in section 17. The proposed section 17 includes a new section 3(8) of the 2006 Act and provides for a proximity-of-age defence where a person is charged with an offence against a child between the ages of 15 and 17 years. It shall be a defence that where the child consented to the activity and the accused is younger or less than two years older than the child or the accused, he or she is not considered to be a person in authority or there is no intimidatory or exploitative element to the relationship. Effectively what I am saying is that the issue Senator Jim Walsh has raised is dealt with in section 17.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendment No. 4 brings additional clarification to section 8 which creates an offence where a person communicates by means of information and communications technology with another person for the purposes of facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child. The offence is committed whether the perpetrator contacts the child directly or contacts a third person to facilitate the sexual exploitation of the child. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the other person referred to in the provision includes the child, the victim. While implicit in the reference to "other person", the amendment makes it explicit.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Article 2 of the EU directive obliges member states to define child pornography as: "any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct". In other words, it covers the case of any real depiction of a child. The definition also includes:Any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes; or"any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or"realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, regardless of the actual existence of such child, for primarily sexual purposes".In this context, the term "a child or someone depicted as a child" is appropriate as determined by the EU directive.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister thanks Senator Jillian van Turnhout for this amendment and will re-examine the drafting of paragraphs (c) and (d) to ensure they cover comprehensively all persons who are or have been in a position of authority through a relationship with the parent of a child.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This addresses a concern about whether a reference to being charged with an offence should refer to a defendant being charged or a person being charged. Substituting the wording "Where, in proceedings for" removes this concern and is consistent with the approach already taken in section 17(4).
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On Second Stage the Minister informed the House that she would introduce amendments to Part 3 of the Bill relating to the purchase of sexual services that further decriminalised the women and men involved in prostitution by removing those who offered sexual services from the existing offences of soliciting and loitering for the purpose of prostitution. Amendment No. 26 makes the necessary provision, while amendment No. 30 ensures no inadvertent consequences may arise from it. Section 7 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 criminalises a person who, in a street or public place, solicits or importunes another person for the purposes of prostitution. Section 8 of that Act creates an offence where a person is loitering in order to solicit or importune another person for the purpose of prostitution and fails to leave that place when directed to do so by a garda. "Soliciting" is defined to include all parties whether male or female, prostitute or client or third party, such as pimp, and includes curb crawling. There have been a number of calls, including from organisations associated with the Turn Off the Red Light campaign, for the removal of those selling sexual services from these offences. The effect of such a change will be that only those people who solicit the sexual services of others, that is, the buyers and pimps, will be prosecuted for the solicitation and loitering offences under the 1993 Act. The primary rationale for decriminalising the sale of sexual services is that those offering the services involved in prostitution are highly vulnerable, often from impoverished backgrounds and frequently with addiction and other issues. It is often the case that those involved in on-street prostitution are among the most vulnerable and marginalised within an already vulnerable group. Retaining criminalisation for solicitation is to penalise this high-risk group. Decriminalisation will also allow people to report violence experienced on the street without fear of prosecution and encourage them to seek appropriate support services. The decriminalisation of on-street prostitution will bring the Irish approach further into line with that of Northern Ireland and the Nordic approach generally. Amendment No. 26 deletes the current paragraph (a), which reads, "offers his or her services as a prostitute to another person", from the definition of "solicits or importunes for the purposes of prostitution" in section 1(2) of the 1993 Act. The effect of the amendment is to remove the persons offering sexual services from the offences under sections 7 and 8 of that Act of soliciting and loitering, respectively, in a public place for the purposes of prostitution. These offences will still apply to any person who solicits a prostitute, that is, the buyer or pimp, or any person who loiters in a public place for the purpose of soliciting a prostitute. The inclusion of this amendment by itself gives rise to concerns that the Garda would be left with no means of combating any public nuisance if sexual offences were to be offered, for example, in a residential area. There is also a concern that the provision could be exploited by criminal gangs or others. Amendment No. 30 addresses these concerns. Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides that a garda may direct a person who is behaving in certain ways, for example, intoxicated, threatening or abusive, to stop behaving in that way or immediately leave the specific area. It is an offence under section 8 to fail to follow such a direction.This amendment will add loitering for the purpose of offering services as a prostitute to the behaviours subject to a direction under section 8. The effect of the proposed amendments will be that on-street prostitution will not itself be an offence, but the Garda will still have the power to move on from a public place when necessary a person or persons offering sexual services. The remaining amendments in this group have been proposed by Senators and I will respond to them after they have been moved.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join others in commending the Turn Off the Red Light campaign for the manner in which it has approached and campaigned on this issue locally, nationally and internationally. This proposal is being made following an examination of the Swedish approach by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The Minister and I have deliberated on the matter with various interest groups in this area. The Swedish approach comes from a Parliament that is 45% female. The issue of gender equality in parliamentary representation is an important one. We should think about that when we discuss the issue of gender quotas also. I accept Senator Ivana Bacik's well made point that we cannot take legislation from another jurisdiction without resourcing and funding it, providing for a process of training with regard to it and discussing with the Garda and others how it will be managed and how it will come into effect. I assure Senator Jim Walsh that we are not going to revisit this issue. I disagree with him and Senator David Norris. They are entitled to their opinion, but I disagree with it, as does the Government.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Arguments are always welcome. The argument for decriminalisation is that the seller is the vulnerable person. Prostitution is a demeaning, undermining and nasty industry. There is nothing glorious or glorified about it, contrary to what seems to have been suggested.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am given to understand that in some circumstances the impression is almost being given that this is a liberating profession. It is an industry that undermines, devalues, dehumanises and demeans those involved in it, most of whom are women but some of whom are men.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In this amendment we are attempting to decriminalise these individuals to ensure they know they can approach the authorities, that help and support are available to them and that they are not criminals by virtue of having been lured or forced into the industry. The great majority of those involved in it are involved in it for reasons of poverty or addiction.The amendment criminalises the buyer, which is an appropriate response. That enables the Garda to tackle the issue properly in a proactive and realistic fashion. I thank the Senators who have spoken about this issue. While I appreciate that people have come to it with different perspectives, the issue of prostitution is one that has been with us for a very long time. To suggest we continue to approach it as we always have does not stand up to scrutiny any more. There are movements across the world to address the issue differently. The Swedish and Northern Irish approaches are being adopted here. As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames said, this is a good day.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senators for their support.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I disagree. The intent is to end demand.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«One tackles demand.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Our effort in order to tackle demand is to criminalise the purchaser and decriminalise the seller in an attempt to ensure the vulnerable seller of sexual services feels society takes a compassionate view of the situations in which they find themselves, that support services will be available to them, that they can approach gardaí without fear of criminal sanction, that they can find a pathway out of prostitution and that the resources of An Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system are channelled and funnelled toward the demand side of the equation. That is the purpose of the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will outline for the House the organisations that have been involved in this campaign, which have been described as radical feminists and right-wing extremists. They include AkiDwA, Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance, Doras Luimní, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Focus Ireland, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, IMPACT trade union, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, my party, the Labour Party - perhaps we are radical feminists - One in Four, Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, the Public Service Executive Union committee, Rape Crisis Network Ireland, SIPTU, Sport against Racism Ireland, Unite and Women's Aid.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Rather than dismissing those groups of individuals who have come to this point of view-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----we should accept that they have come to this view because, like all in this House, they are trying to do what is best. I have only listed a number of organisations, but they should not be dismissed as having any motive apart from what is best for those who find themselves in a very vulnerable postion.  The amendment inserts a review provision into the Bill in respect of one section only, namely, section 20, which criminalises the purchase of sexual services. I assure the Senator that all the provisions in the Bill which, in addition to dealing with the exploitation associated with prostitution, address the sexual exploitation of children and protections for victims in the criminal process will be kept under continuous review. While I appreciate that there is a similar provision in the Northern Ireland legislation, the provisions in this Bill are too important not to be fully and properly implemented and I have no doubt it will be kept under review, with or without the proposed amendment. It is also the case that the information sought should be available on request at any time without the need for a future review provision. Given the considerable debate on these provisions, I fully expect the information to be sought from my Department well in advance of a two-year review. In so far as the amendment sets out particular matters to be reviewed, since 2009 the anti-human trafficking unit of my Department has been providing annual reports on trafficking in human beings in Ireland. These annual reports are available on a dedicated anti-human trafficking website blueblindfold.gov.ie. Information on the extent of prostitution offences is available from the CSO and is regularly published. I certainly expect issues impacting negatively on the safety and well-being of prostitutes to be addressed as they arise, but, as I have said and while there has been much discourse and narrative on this point, there is no substantive evidence showing a negative impact on the safety of those who provide sexual services in those jurisdictions where a similar approach has been implemented.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«For these reasons and because of a minor drafting difficulty with the amendment, I am not in a position to accept it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I did not say that. I said all-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I did not say it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I said all legislation was kept under constant review. With regard to this amendment, it clearly has been cut and pasted from the Northern Irish legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The word "Assembly" appears in the amendment and it would have to be amended before it could be considered.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am ready for the Senator. Bring it on.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sections 20 and 21 provide for two offences in the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services. The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute and the second is the more serious offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a trafficked person. These provisions are the result of considerable and extensive public consultation by the Department of Justice and Equality but primarily by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which recommended similar proposals in 2013. The matter has already been the subject of considerable debate both inside and outside these Houses and even beyond the State. In deciding on these provisions the Minister considered all sides of the debate and the experience of those states that have introduced similar measures and those that have addressed prostitution in a different way. The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution. Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking. However, even to leave aside this unquestionable objective, there is undoubtedly evidence of wider exploitation of persons involved in prostitution outside those trafficked such as those coerced or otherwise forced through circumstances to engage in the activity.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The most direct way of combating this form of exploitation is to send a message to those who pay for these services and those who ignore the exploitation of the women and men that their behaviour is not acceptable and supports the exploitation of others. Senator David Norris raised many aspects in the debate today. He raised issues about the impact of the provisions and the safety, health and well-being of those who work in prostitution. The Minister is well aware of the arguments and concerns. In deciding to put forward her proposals, she listened to all sides of the debate and is convinced that targeting the exploitation associated with prostitution requires targeting those who demand prostitutes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senators for the amendment. It proposes to increase the penalty for the organisation of prostitution. The Minister supports the aim of the Senators' proposal. There have been calls to review the existing penalties for offences relating to prostitution. The Minister has concerns about some penalties in this area, for example, the maximum penalty for living on the earnings of prostitution of another person, pimping, is only a maximum of six months imprisonment. The Minister has asked for a review of the penalties for all offences relating to prostitution. On Report Stage she will be increasing the penalty for loitering and will bring forward other amendments where a forum is appropriate.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senator. The Minister appreciates the purpose behind the proposed amendment, but she has initial misgivings about it. The purpose of the provisions in sections 22 and 23 is to remove the existing gender anomaly relating to the penalty for incest by a male as opposed to by a female. Otherwise, they reflect the provisions of the Punishment of Incest Act 1908. When offences of this nature occur, generally an adult and child are involved. The 1908 provisions were undoubtedly intended to protect children within the family, but they were also motivated by the potentially adverse effects on any children born out of such relationships and eugenic considerations generally. For this reason, the Act and the amended provisions proposed in the Bill limit the offence to an act between persons where pregnancy is most likely. The Senator's amendment would broaden the offence in this respect. For instance, the current offence of incest by a male includes a male who has carnal knowledge of his granddaughter but not a male who has carnal knowledge of his grandmother. Equally, in so far as there is an offence of incest by a female, it may occur where there is carnal knowledge with her grandfather but not her grandson. Obviously, where a person engages in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years, the existing defilement offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 will apply. However, where it is an offence of incest, the relationships within which the offence may arise are limited to those most likely to result in pregnancy. Therefore, the Minister wants to examine this aspect of the amendment to ensure that it does not unnecessarily extend the offence of incest. The amendment would limit the offence to persons over the age of 17 years where currently that limit only applies to females and not to males. The amendment would exempt males under 17 years of age from the offence, thus restricting its scope while expanding its extent by unifying the categories of prohibited relationships for both sexes. We must be careful not to bring about unintended or unnecessary consequences. The Supreme Court has adjudicated that the Oireachtas is entitled to protect girls under the age of 17 years from the risk of pregnancy because a girl potentially carries a greater burden from the act physically and emotionally should she become pregnant. The Minister is concerned that accepting the amendment may preclude, where appropriate, the prosecution of a male of, for example, 16 years of age. The amendment also would delete subsection (2) from the offence of incest by a male. Under subsection (2), a male cannot rely on the consent of a female as a defence to a charge of incest. While there is no similar provision in the offence by a female, it would not be correct to suggest that the offence by a female can be defended by the consent of the male. The nature of the offence by the female is different than that committed by a male. The offence by a female is committed where she permits a specified male relative to have carnal knowledge of her. Consent on the part of both parties is, therefore, implied and an element of the offence. Relying on the defence of consent on the part of the male would not arise. The offence by a male is committed where he has carnal knowledge of the female. A provision clarifying that consent of the female is not a defence is, therefore, required and brings it into line with the offence by a female. Removing this provision from the offence by a male would mean a male could rely on consent as a defence but a female could not. For these reasons, we cannot accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a difficult discussion to have and I understand that it can cause great upset to people who have been victims of this offence or affected by it. In a technical sense, the offence of incest is limited to those relationships that may result in pregnancy. On that basis, sexual intercourse between two brothers would not be considered to be incest.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No, the Senator is right. A female under the age of 17 years cannot commit an offence. Someone who is 16 and three quarters years of age would not be committing an offence.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In any legislation dealing with an age limit, this matter will always arise. One could say it is nonsensical for somebody who is 17 years and 364 days old not to be able to vote, but that is the reality of our current arrangement. It features in this legislation also. It is the Supreme Court adjudication that the Oireachtas is entitled to protect girls under the age of 17 years from the risk of pregnancy as a girl would potentially carry a greater burden from the legislation physically and emotionally should she become pregnant. The Minister is concerned that accepting the Senator's amendment may preclude, where appropriate, the prosecution of a male of, say, 16 years. While I can understand the Senator's examples, the law draws a line in the sand when it comes to somebody's age. That is the way it has been and the way it always will be.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are not saying that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Again, the language is quite clear. The legislation refers to protecting girls from the risk of pregnancy. The Oireachtas has a responsibility to protect girls from the risk of pregnancy. We are not in any way suggesting that somebody under 17 years cannot become pregnant. Such a suggestion would be preposterous. The Supreme Court adjudication dates from 2006.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is why we are protecting them. My point has been made. It is our responsibility as legislators to protect a girl under the age of 17 years from a risk of pregnancy through a sexual violation, sexual assault, rape or incest. That is what we are dealing with. In a manner, we are dancing on the head of a pin, but essentially the point has been made.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Section 33 regulates the disclosure of the content of third-party counselling or therapy records in sexual offence trials. The disclosure of counselling or therapy records in the context of criminal proceedings, especially with regard to sexual violence, touches on several sensitive issues and balancing of rights. The right to a fair trial for an accused must be respected. However, so too does the right of the victim not to feel further violated in the criminal justice process. This section establishes a process for the disclosure of such records, where appropriate. Since the publication of the Bill, the Minister for Justice and Equality has received several submissions proposing changes to this section. Notably, submissions from the Ombudsman for Children, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and Q4, representing the child sexual assault units in Temple Street and Crumlin children’s hospitals, are being considered by officials in the Department of Justice and Equality. The necessary balancing of fundamental rights involved in the disclosure of sensitive personal records requires careful consideration from both a legal and operational perspective. The Minister expects to be in a position to address several concerns raised about this section by way of amendment as the Bill progresses through the Houses. For example, the Minister intends to accept one proposal raised in the submissions of Q4 and Rape Crisis Network Ireland, namely, the removal of all references to the competence of the complainant or witness to testify, as she is persuaded that counselling records are not relevant to competence. With regard to the specific amendments proposed, I thank Senators Jillian van Turnhout, Denis O’Donovan, David Cullinane, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly for their amendments. The Minister fully appreciates the points they have made. Senator Jillian van Turnhout’s amendments Nos. 35 and 43 propose a separate disclosure regime to apply to children. The Minister is concerned that difficulties would arise in applying two regimes simultaneously but will consider the particular protections applying to children as part of the review of this section. As to amendment No. 36, there are several difficulties with the definition of “relevant record” proposed. The proposed amendment deletes the reference to the prosecutor having sight or knowledge of the record, making it almost impossible to identify which records would be subject to a disclosure application and pre-trial hearing. Requiring, by definition, that the record has some probative or evidential value also raises the question of how this can be determined in advance of a pre-trial hearing and may create a presumption in favour of the disclosure of the record at a hearing. These are matters appropriate to the hearing. Amendments Nos. 37 to 41, inclusive, seek changes to the list of assertions in section 33(4) which, on their own, will not establish the relevance of a record, and the factors in section 33(9) which the court must consider in determining whether to disclose a record. These are issues which have also been raised in the submissions the Minister has received and the two subsections in particular are being reviewed. The Minister is minded to take on board some of the changes proposed. However, it is important to emphasise again that a careful balancing of rights is involved to ensure the disclosure provisions are constitutionally sound.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senator for bringing forward these amendments. This question of introducing a statutory definition of consent has been raised by a number of groups, in particular those who work with and support the victims of sexual offences and also by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in terms of domestic and sexual violence. Moreover, this is an issue which does not appear to have received any significant consideration since Law Reform Commission's proposals in 1988. I know that the Minister is of the view that the question of providing a statutory definition of consent is overdue for review and that she has directed officials within her Department to undertake that work. There is a clear understanding of the arguments favouring a statutory definition, including the clarity and understanding it will bring, as well as the assistance it could offer jurors, particularly in cases that may be difficult to adjudicate. However, there are also concerns that a statutory definition of consent may mean the flexibility of the common law system would be lost. Aside from whether there should be a statutory definition of consent and if the answer is "Yes", what that definition should be, there are also a number of other questions which must be considered. Other common law jurisdictions have adopted different approaches to what is or is not consent. For instance, in the United Kingdom consent is defined with the addition of listing both evidential and conclusive presumptions about consent. While not defining consent itself, the New Zealand approach is to list the circumstances under which allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent. The Canadian model defines consent, as well as setting out those circumstances where no consent is obtained and those circumstances under which a defendant's belief that consent was given would not be a defence. While other jurisdictions share a number of similarities in their approach to the question of consent to a sexual act, there are differences, and Ireland should adopt a model appropriate to this jurisdiction. That is a complex matter which warrants a comprehensive review and appropriate consultation with those involved in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. While that process is ongoing, the Minister is currently unable to accommodate Senator Denis O'Donovan's amendments today but, again, I thank him. The approach adopted in these amendments will also form part of the further consideration of this issue.

Is fíor go bhfuil cúraimí Gaeltachta agus oileán leagtha ar an Aire Stáit sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta.Cuireann an Roinn fóirdheontas ar fáil chun seirbhísí iompair a chur ar fáil chuig na hoileáin a bhfuil cónaí orthu thart timpeall an chósta. Tá na seirbhísí seo comhdhéanta de sheirbhísi farantóireachta paisinéara agus lastais. In theannta sin, tugann an Roinn fóirdheontas chun seirbhís aeir a chur ar fáil chuig na trí Oileán Árann, ar a n-áirítear Inis Mór, faoi chonradh oibleagáid sheirbhís phoiblí, nó PSO, mar a deir an Seanadóir féin. Mar chuid de seo, cuireann an Roinn cúnamh ar fáil don seirbhís bainistíochta do na haeradróim atá lonnaithe ar na hoileáin. San iomlán, tá seirbhísí taistil fóirdheonaithe á maoiniú ag an Roinn do 19 oileán i nDún na nGall, Maigh Eo, i nGaillimh agus i gCorcaigh. Cinntíonn an tacaíocht sin go mbíonn córas taistil sábháilte rialta ar fáil do na hoileáin don bhliain iomlán. Leis an gcúnamh sin bíonn feabhas ar chaighdeán maireachtála na n-oileánach a thacaíonn le pobail inmharthana agus a chuidíonn le turasóireacht. Anuas ar an méid sin, tá an Roinn, ó nios luaithe i mbliana, ag maoiniú na struchtúir bhainistíochta ar na hoileáin neamh-Ghaeltachta. Bhí buiséad de €5.9 milliún ar fáil don Roinn sa bhliain 2015 le caitheamh ar chúrsaí taistil do na hoileáin. Meabhraím don Seanadóir agus don Teach gur caitheadh 57% den bhuiséad sin ar sheirbhísí iompair do na hOileáin Árann. Maidir le hÁrainn, nó Inis Mór, tháinig deireadh leis an gconradh farantóireachta paisinéirí don oileán sin ar 31 Eanáir 2013. Chuaigh mo Roinn i mbun phróiseas tairisceana poiblí sa ghnáthshlí, chun conradh nua cúig bliana suas go dtí an 31 Eanáir 2018 a aontú. Ní bhfuair an Roinn aon tairiscint i leith na seirbhíse laistigh den sprioc-am, áfach. In éagmais tairisceana, bhí comhráití idir oifigigh na Roinne agus an farantóir a bhí ag cur na seirbhíse ar fáil, chun plé a dhéanamh ar an bhféidearthacht teacht ar réiteach chun conradh nua a aontú ar na téarmaí céanna is a bhí sa chonradh roimhe sin. Faraor, níor éirigh leis na comhráití sin mar nach bhféadfadh an Roinn géilleadh d’éilimh an fharantóra go mbeadh ardú substaintiúil ar an bhfóirdheontas ar sheirbhís atá, de réir cosúlachta, eacnamaíoch gan fóirdheontas. Pé scéal é, lean an farantóir ar aghaidh ag cur na seirbhíse ar fáil ag an am. Ansin sa bhliain 2014, bhí sé ráite ag an bhfarantóir céanna nach mbeadh aon rogha aige ach éirí as an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil ó Shamhain 2014 mar bhí caillteanas á dhéanamh ag an gcuideachta agus ní fhéadfaí Ieanúint ar aghaidh. Chinn an Roinn go mb'fhearr tairiscintí poibli a lorg sa ghnáthbhealach do chonradh níos faide a thiocfadh chun críoch ar an 31 Deireadh Fómhair 2017, an t-am céanna a chríochnódh an conradh le Aran Ferries Teo do sheirbhís Inis Meáin agus Inis Oirr. Fuarthas tairiscint amháin ó Aran Ferries Teo. Cuireadh coiste le chéile chun measúnú a dhéanamh ar an tairiscint sin. Bhí cruinniú idir an Roinn agus an comhlacht ar 22 Deireadh Fómhair 2014 mar chuid den idirbheartaíocht agus tar éis go leor plé rinne siad féin cinneadh go bhfágfaí rudaí mar a bhí, gan aon chonradh leis an Roinn, agus go leanfadh Aran Ferries Teo ag cur na seírbhíse ar fáil tríd an ngeimhreadh chomh maith leis an samhradh. Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an farantóir sásta Ieanúint leis an tseirbhís bhliantúil i gcónaí ag an mhinicíocht chéanna gan fóirdheontas ón Roinn. Tá éisteacht tugtha ag an Roinn don chuideachta agus tuigim go bhfuil an deacracht atá ann faoi Iáthair ag eascairt as na fodhlíthe até le cur i bhfeidhm ag Comhairle Contae na Galllimhe. Ba mhaith liom a shoiléiriú don Seanadóir go bhfuiI an tAire oscailte d’aon chéim réasúnta a thógáil a chuideodh le réiteach a fháil ar an gceist ata ardaithe aige. Tuigim nach bhfuil an farantóir ag éileamh fhóirdheontais ón Roinn ach go bhfuil sé ráite aige nach mbeidh sé in ann seirbhís a chur ar fáil sa gheimhreadh má chuirtear na fodhlíthe i bhfeidhm. Is léir don Aire mar sin go mbaineann an cheist áirithe atá faoi chaibidil ag an Seanadóir le Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe agus an farantóir. É sin réite tá an tAire Stáit le freagracht as na hoileáin, sásta tathant ar na páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla teacht le chéile chun a chinntiú go leanfar leis an tseirbhís farantóireachta chuig Árainn. Is féidir liom a chinntiú don Seanadóir go leanfar le gach iarracht chun a chinntiú go mbeidh seirbhis farantóireacht rialta do phaisinéirí chuig an oileán i rith na bliana agus go bhfuil an Roinn ar fáil aon am le haghaidh comhráití.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as an méid sin. Tá sé ag iarraidh a rá go gcaithfimid a bheith réasúnta agus níl i gceist anseo ach cruinniú a shocrú idir na páirtithe uilig. Labhróidh mé leis an Aire Stáit. Dar liom féin, is plean réasúnta é sin ar bhealach agus b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn dul síos an bhealach sin. Beidh mé ag caint leis an Aire Stáit agus inseoidh mé dó an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Senator is aware, the Government approved the publication of the heads and general scheme of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2015 last July. The Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operates on the basis of presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible. The Bill will, for the first time, provide a statutory basis for the provision of information related to both past and future adoptions. It will provide clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided. Efforts have been ongoing for many years to address the issues related to the provision of a statutory entitlement to identity information, in particular an original birth certificate to adopted persons. The overall policy objective in bringing forward proposed legislation on adoption information and tracing has always been to provide access to as much information as possible to adopted persons. The adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2015 provides that where an adoption was effected prior to the commencement of the Bill, the information required to apply for a birth certificate will be provided for an adopted person when he or she has signed a statutory declaration agreeing to respect the privacy of their birth parent and not to contact their birth parent or ask anyone else to make contact on his or her behalf. There will be no requirement for an adopted person to sign a statutory declaration where birth parents have indicated a preference for contact or have consented to the release of the information or where it is established that the birth parents are deceased. The Bill also provides that where an adoption is effected after the commencement of the Bill, an adopted person will be entitled to their his or her certificate once he or she is aged 18 years or over. The Bill also provides that the Adoption Authority of Ireland will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and the safekeeping of adoption records, including information on informal adoptions and persons whose birth was incorrectly registered. It will set out the information that must be retained by the authority for future adoptions and, in so far as it is available, for past adoptions, persons whose adoption is registered in the register of inter-country adoptions, informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations Persons who were the subject of incorrect birth registrations will be given access to service provision. The Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny and the committee published its report recently. The committee’s key recommendations were that the definition of "compelling reasons" be further clarified and more tightly defined in the Bill. In cases where non-disclosure is sought citing compelling reasons, this should be supported by medical evidence. Consideration should be given to excluding the statutory declaration provision from the Bill. This could possibly be replaced by an alternative provision where the applicant is required, before the birth certificate is released, to attend one preparatory session to discuss and explore the issues concerning privacy and respect. Consideration should be given to reducing the lead-in to a much shorter time period and to holding a shorter, more intense information awareness campaign over a six-month period, to include engagement with social media and a wide range of community groups which can help to raise awareness about the new register. In the case of the illegally adopted, consideration should be given to establishing a dedicated unit to investigate those cases actively and a review of service requirements arising from the Bill should be undertaken. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, welcomes the report of the Oireachtas committee and believes it is a valuable contribution to the debate on this important Bill. He has examined the recommendations of the committee very carefully and will shortly finalise the Bill in the light of the committee’s recommendations. The heads will be submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel very shortly with a request to draft the Bill as a matter of urgency. In view of the size and complexity of the Bill, the Minister does not want to offer any guarantee about how quickly it can be finalised. However, he wishes to assure the Senator that he will work closely with the Attorney General to facilitate the Bill's completion as soon as possible.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Senator's commitment to this issue and her own personal connection with it. I will endeavour to discuss the issue with the Minister, Deputy James Reilly. I am sure that whatever progress can be made on the Bill before the ending of the term of Parliament will be made.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who regrets that she cannot be here, I am very pleased to present the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill to the House and look forward to hearing Senators' contributions. It is a very significant reforming Bill, and I will highlight its main objectives. The Bill proposes three key changes to bankruptcy law in Ireland, as follows: the normal duration of bankruptcy is reduced from three years to one year; the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order - the payments a court may direct the bankrupt person to make towards his or her creditors - is reduced from five years to three years; and a bankrupt person's legal interest in his or her home will, in general, transfer back to him or her automatically three years after bankruptcy adjudication, if the official assignee in bankruptcy has not taken steps to sell it before that date. These are important changes. They recognise that bankruptcy is not an easy option and that the large majority of bankrupt people never intended to end up in bankruptcy and have already co-operated in an open manner with the bankruptcy process and handed over their income and assets towards repayment of their debts. For these people, the reforms contained in this Bill offer a second chance. They will be able to exit bankruptcy and return to normal economic activity much more quickly, in line with the position in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is good for them and the economy. The Bill ensures significant sanctions to deter and penalise anyone who tries to abuse the bankruptcy process or to conceal his or her income or assets from creditors. In such cases, the High Court will retain the power to extend the bankruptcy term to up to eight years, and to extend the duration of a bankruptcy payment order to up to five years. A new provision will allow the High Court to extend the bankruptcy term to up to 15 years, where it is satisfied that there has been particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment. The Bill modernises key aspects of bankruptcy procedures. It will achieve the following: abolish the outdated requirement for an extra High Court hearing, the so-called statutory sitting, in all bankruptcy cases; enable the official assignee to disclaim onerous properties, which would effectively impose net costs on the taxpayer; and ensure that the official assignee has clear powers to demand and investigate electronic records relating to a bankrupt's assets and affairs. While these changes are procedural, they are, nevertheless, vital, given that they will remove unnecessary costs and delays, free up court time and resources and allow more efficient and effective bankruptcy administration. The Bill provides for appropriate transitional arrangements; therefore, people already in bankruptcy will also get the benefit of these reforms subject, at maximum, to a six-month transitional period. The Minister for Justice and Equality has already acknowledged in the Dáil two major contributions to the thinking behind this Bill. One was the Private Members' Bill, sponsored by Deputy Willie Penrose, which was published in March this year and the provisions of which have been incorporated into this Bill, subject to some necessary amendments. The other was the report on bankruptcy reform by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which was undertaken last summer at the Minister's request. The joint committee held a public consultation and examined over 100 submissions before providing the Minister with its report in July which, likewise, recommended reducing the bankruptcy term to one year. The Minister wishes to again express her appreciation to the joint committee for its extensive work, as well as the Oireachtas joint committee on finance and the many stakeholders and individuals who made valuable submissions. The Bill to reform bankruptcy law will not operate in isolation, but will complement the significant reforms the Minister has already introduced to personal insolvency law, with the enactment earlier this year of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act and the commencement in recent weeks of its new independent court review of the so-called “bank veto”, where creditors reject a personal insolvency proposal. A number of review cases have already been lodged with the courts. The Government has also taken important steps in recent months to reduce costs and increase accessibility of insolvency and bankruptcy procedures. This includes the Minister's decision to waive court and insolvency service fees for insolvency cases, and to substantially reduce bankruptcy costs. It also includes the implementation of a nationwide network of dedicated mortgage arrears services in Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, centres. MABS and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, with the co-operation of the Courts Service, are already ensuring a presence at all Circuit Court hearings around the country for repossession, to provide information and support for those in mortgage arrears on their homes. This is a very important initiative. On behalf of the Minister, I urge anyone worried about debts, particularly anyone at risk of repossession, to contact MABS which will put them in touch with the help they need. I will outline the thematic provisions of the Bill. Under section 10(a) of the Bill, the normal duration of bankruptcy will be reduced from three years to one year, as recommended by the joint committee in its report. This will also correspond to the position in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The joint committee report expressed concern that reducing the bankruptcy term should not benefit bankruptcies which appeared to be deliberate or fraudulent. The Bill responds to this concern by retaining provision for a considerably longer bankruptcy term of up to eight years where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt is not co-operating with the bankruptcy, or has tried to conceal assets or income. The Bill also allows for longer extension in particularly serious cases of non-co-operation or concealment. Bankruptcy payment orders are court orders made on the application of the official assignee which require a bankrupt to make payments for the benefit of his or her creditors from any surplus income or assets after reasonable living expenses for the bankrupt and any dependant. Section 12 will reduce the normal maximum duration of a bankruptcy payment order from five years to three years. However, the maximum five-year duration will still apply in cases where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt has not co-operated with the bankruptcy, or has tried to conceal assets or income. When a person becomes bankrupt, his or her interest in any property he or she owns, including his or her home, passes automatically to the official assignee, whose duty is to sell it, if feasible, to repay creditors. Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act protects any spouse or civil partner of the bankrupt, by requiring the official assignee to apply to court for leave to sell the home if it is a family home under the Family Home Protection Act 1976, or a shared home under the Civil Partnership Act 2010. The official assignee will try to dispose of the bankrupt's interest in the property, preferably to the spouse or civil partner. However, in many cases, and particularly where the property is in negative equity, no purchaser can be found. Section 10(c) of the Bill proposes a practical solution in such cases, by providing that the bankrupt's interest in the home will automatically revest in him or her three years after the bankruptcy adjudication, unless the court orders otherwise, the bankrupt and the official assignee agree otherwise, or the official assignee has sold it or applied for a court order authorising sale before that date. A similar provision already applies in England and Wales. This applies to the bankrupt's home at the date of bankruptcy adjudication, whether it is his or her family home, shared civil partnership home, or principal private residence as a single person. This will also allow for more efficient and cost-effective administration of bankruptcy cases, particularly those with very limited resources. Given that the bankrupt's interest in his or her home remains subject to any mortgage, the position of the mortgage lender is not affected. The Bill introduces at section 11 a new power for the court to extend the bankruptcy term up to a total of 15 years on application by the official assignee, where the court considers it just to do so in cases of particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt. This arises because a relatively small number of bankruptcy cases feature particularly serious and flagrant levels of such conduct by the bankrupt, for which there is currently no adequate deterrent. The new 15-year maximum term is modelled on the approach in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the USA a bankrupt's debts are only discharged if he or she has co-operated with the bankruptcy trustee, which is equivalent to our official assignee. In the United Kingdom legislation allows the bankrupt to remain subject to a bankruptcy restriction order in cases of non-co-operation, which continues bankruptcy restrictions for up to 15 years. Section 4 will abolish the requirement under the Bankruptcy Act to hold an additional sitting of the High Court in every bankruptcy case some weeks after adjudication, which must be attended by the bankrupt, the creditors and the official assignee. The original purposes of the statutory sitting are now superseded. It is widely seen as an outdated formality which is a major strain on court resources. It also creates unnecessary legal costs and workload for creditors and the official assignee and further stress to debtors who are largely unrepresented and have already gone through a public adjudication hearing. Its abolition will free up considerable time for the courts and the official assignee and will also benefit the parties involved. Sections 6, 7, and 15 will clarify the wording of several provisions in the Bankruptcy Act to put it beyond doubt that electronic as well as paper records are covered by the powers of the court or the official assignee to demand accounts and records for the purposes of investigating a bankrupt's affairs. This is important to assist the official assignee in investigating a small number of high-asset cases in which a bankrupt may have concealed assets. The next item is the power of the official assignee to disclaim onerous assets, which is an important provision. Section 8 will allow the official assignee effective power to refuse to accept responsibility for any property of the bankrupt which is likely to generate substantial costs and where there are no funds in the bankruptcy estate to cover these costs. When the official assignee takes over a bankrupt's property, he or she becomes legally responsible for any costs and liabilities arising from it. These can include unpaid rates, property tax, management charges, essential repairs, ongoing security and insurance for properties which may not be generating any revenue. At the same time, the official assignee has no power to compel any contribution from the secured lender who is entitled to receive any proceeds from the sale of these properties. Consequently, these costs risk being imposed on the State and the taxpayer. The current provision for disclaim in the Bankruptcy Act effectively only applies to liabilities arising under a lease, which does not cover the many types of liability mentioned above. In the United Kingdom this problem was addressed by the Insolvency Act 1986, which gives the official assignee a broad power to disclaim any onerous property. It means that such costs are, more appropriately, the responsibility of the secured creditor who will receive the benefit of the property concerned. The proposed amendment in the Bill follows the same approach. It will generate considerable savings for the State and the taxpayer, as well as improving the overall efficiency of bankruptcy administration.
In terms of transitional arrangements, any bankruptcy already existing when the Bill comes into effect will also benefit from the changes introduced by this Bill, subject to a six-month transitional period. This reflects the six-month transition period that was provided previously when the bankruptcy term was reduced from 12 years to three by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. It is needed to ensure a smooth transition and to enable the official assignee to make any necessary applications to the court for extension of time in cases which raise issues of non-co-operation or attempted concealment. Under the transitional provisions and assuming that there are no grounds for extension, the following occurs. First, an existing bankruptcy which is to terminate three years after adjudication and is due to terminate less than six months after the commencement date of the Bill will terminate on its due date. Other existing bankruptcies will now terminate one year after adjudication or six months after commencement, if that is the later date. Second, an existing bankruptcy payment order due to expire five years after it was made by the court, if it is already due to expire less than six months after the commencement date, will terminate on its due date. Other existing bankruptcy payment orders will now expire three years after they were made or six months after commencement, if that is a later date. The provision for re-vesting of the bankrupt's interest in his or her home applies to a bankruptcy at the date the Bill comes into effect. Re-vesting would take place, subject to the exceptions that I have already outlined, either on the third anniversary of adjudication or six months after the commencement date, whichever is the later. I will briefly mention the specific provisions of the Bill. The technical content and effect of each section is set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.
 Sections 3 to 5, inclusive, abolish the mandatory requirement for a statutory sitting. They replace references to the statutory sitting in other sections of the Bankruptcy Act. Sections 6 and 7 amend sections 19 and 21 of the Bankruptcy Act. They clarify that the powers of the official assignee and the High Court to require the production of a bankrupt person's accounts and records extend to electronic records. Section 8 is the provision for the official assignee to disclaim onerous properties. Section 9 clarifies section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act regarding the protection of a family home under the Family Home Protection Act or a shared home under the Civil Partnership Act 2010. These changes will aid the interpretation of section 10 of the Bill regarding the re-vesting of the bankrupt's home. Section 10 contains the important provision for reduction of the bankruptcy term and re-vesting of the bankrupt person's home with the relevant transitional arrangements. Section 11 provides the new power for the court to extend the bankruptcy term for up to 15 years in cases of particularly serious non co-operation or concealment. Section 12 reduces the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order from five years to three years, with the relevant transitional arrangements. If the court is satisfied that there has been non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt, however, the maximum duration remains at five years. Sections 13 and 14 are consequential amendments and both replace references to the statutory sitting. Section 15 is a further amendment to clarify that electronic records are included in section 123 of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides that it is an offence for a bankrupt person to withhold, conceal or falsify records of their affairs. As every Senator in this House is aware, the background to the economic crisis means that those now entering bankruptcy, or already in bankruptcy, have already struggled with unsustainable debt and managed on very restricted incomes for several years. The measures in the Bill will provide the people concerned with a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel and an earlier return to normal economic activity. As the Small Firms Association underlined in its submission to the joint committee's bankruptcy review, reducing the term to one year will, in particular, provide that vital second chance for a small entrepreneur to restart in business. At the same time, the Bill includes strong provisions to ensure that any bankrupt person who tries to conceal his or her resources from creditors or evade his or her obligations will end up with a longer bankruptcy term and a longer bankruptcy payment order. The Bill makes important changes to modernise bankruptcy procedures, reduce unnecessary costs and ensure the official assignee has effective powers to focus on the small minority of bankruptcies in which there may be issues of fraud and concealment. The Bill is a further example of the Government's commitment to bringing forward reforms to ensure a more enlightened, less punitive and less costly approach to addressing intractable debt, and a fair balance between the interests of debtors and creditors. I commend the Bill to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senators for their interest in the Bill and for their contributions to the debate. This is a significant, reforming Bill which will complement the reforms already introduced to personal insolvency legislation. The most important element of the legislation is the reduction of the bankruptcy term from three years to one year, a fundamental change which follows the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality as well as the efforts of my party colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose. This will ease the impact of bankruptcy on people who have already been struggling with unsustainable debt and living on very reduced incomes for several years. The provision for revesting the family home, if steps have not been taken for its sale within three years of bankruptcy, is another practical and humane solution. At this stage, a bankrupt would normally be discharged from bankruptcy and cleared of any unsecured debts which can help in making mortgage repayments more affordable.The High Court's new power to extend the bankruptcy term to 15 years in serious cases of non-co-operation or concealment of assets is significant and will address the small minority of situations where a bankrupt person seeks to hide assets or income from creditors. Another very important change is the new power for the official assignee to disclaim properties to avoid a situation where standing liabilities must be borne by the taxpayer when any proceeds of sale are retained by secured creditors. There are also the traditional provisions which ensure people already in bankruptcy can benefit directly from the changes introduced by the Bill with a transitional period of up to six months. It is essential to underline that bankruptcy is never an easy option and is not the right solution for everyone. Bankruptcy does not wipe out mortgage arrears. Personal insolvency solutions may work better for some households which is the reason section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act requires the High Court to consider whether a personal insolvency solution would be more appropriate to a debtor's circumstances before agreeing to the application to be adjudged bankrupt. Senator Aideen Hayden asked about personal insolvency reviews. The court review contains an express provision exempting a case from the requirement to show consent of a class of creditor if there is only one creditor. This is an important features of the review. Where there is only one creditor, the court passes directly to considering the fairness criteria of the review and does not need proof of consent from one class of creditor. I appreciate Senator Averil Power's support of the Bill. As I indicated earlier, with regard to her question on the transitional arrangements and the risk of backlogs, the Bill will put in place arrangements for a smooth transition for all existing bankruptcies. The official assignee and the insolvency service have been fully consulted on the transitional arrangements and we are satisfied the provisions of the Bill are manageable. Additional measures in the Bill to reform and streamline bankruptcy procedures will also free up resources in the courts and for the official assignee and will further ensure no backlogs arise. Senator Paschal Mooney raised a number of issues, but he is no longer in the House.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I apologise. How dare I suggest he is no longer in the House and that he is no longer interested in the debate?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know what that feels like. On the points Senator Paschal Mooney raised and the statistics he quoted on those in bankruptcy losing their family homes, a small study was carried out by official assignees in respect of initial cases in bankruptcy. It is important to note many of the families had surrendered their homes to the banks before they entered bankruptcy. Certainly, personal insolvency solutions protect the family home better than bankruptcy. The Government has always emphasised the home is at risk in bankruptcy but the 70% statistic needs to be seen in context and may overstate the risks. With regard to measures taken on mortgage arrears, there is a decline in mortgage arrears exceeding 90 and 180 days, which is to be welcomed. The most serious category of home mortgage arrears are those which exceed two years, and while arrears remain far higher than we would wish to see there is a clear positive trend. This group of arrears has stopped increasing and the latest quarterly statistics show even the most difficult category of arrears is reducing, which is a welcome indicator. I accept the points made to the effect that more needs to be done. I appreciate the efforts of individual Senators and Deputies and thank Senators for their contributions. The Bill is a very important and far-reaching reforming legislation. It is well balanced and will bring immediate practical advantages to many households which have gone through some very dark and difficult years. I welcome the general support of the Bill expressed by Senators. I again apologise to Senator Paschal Mooney for not realising he was sitting behind me. I might have a very short life in politics if I do not realise who is behind me.

AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Government, I thank Senators Fiach Mac Conghail, Jillian van Turnhout, Katherine Zappone, Averil Power and Mary Ann O'Brien for tabling this Private Members' motion and the opportunity to update the House on developments in the systems that operate in the State to offer protection and shelter to those in the asylum application process. It is important to always state in this House that what is good about this Parliament is that when questions are asked about immigration policy and protection policy, they come from a position of compassion. We are not having in Ireland what they are having in Denmark. We are having a conversation in Ireland where the Government is being pressed to have potentially a more humanitarian approach. We do not have political posturing on an anti-immigration type platform. That is something we have to hold on to and about which we do not become complacent. The issue does not become a feature of general elections nor does it become a feature of the political discourse at that difficult time for candidates. I believe that is appropriate and hope we can hold on to that. The term "direct provision" describes the system whereby the State directly provides accommodation and other ancillary needs for those who apply for asylum in Ireland. When an applicant presents himself or herself for protection, the State is in the position to immediately offer an applicant a place to stay, shelter, a bed, three meals a day and other services on a voluntary basis. The fact that Ireland, even at the height of its financial challenges, has maintained its commitment to a system of directly providing for applicants' needs is important and clearly demonstrates the State's commitment to support those fleeing persecution. The Government acknowledged that what was to be a temporary system of shelter and provision has evolved into a more long-term provision and it is here that many challenges have arisen. The Government established a high level working group in October 2014 to report to it on improvements in the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. A comprehensive report, including 173 recommendations was submitted to the Government by the chairman, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, and published on 30 June 2015 and it is good to see him in the House this evening. This Oireachtas and those living in direct provision centres owe him a great debt of gratitude. The report's key conclusion was that the system of directly providing for applicants' needs had evolved from being a short-term measure into a long-term one primarily as a result of the multi-layered determination and appeals process. The document held up by Senator Fiach Mac Conghail is the only one the Department is working off. Anybody facing into the general election should make the commitment that document is the only one that any of us, on returning to these Houses and I hope to government, should seek to implement in its entirety. Applicants are involved in a sequential process where each element of their refugee application is considered, appealed or judicially reviewed and exhausted before any other information such as their qualification for subsidiary protection, can be considered. The sequence of appeal and review is then possibly repeated and exhausted before any other humanitarian matters can finally be considered for permission to remain. This sequential application system has meant that some applicants' needs are directly provided for by the State for long periods of time. The report urged action to address this length of time issue and the Government, with the approval of this House, passed the International Protection Bill on 18 December 2015, in the process addressing 26 of the 78 recommendations made in the report specifically in relation to the protection determination process.The successful implementation of this reform should ensure that in the future delays in the processing of applications will not be the cause of persons spending lengthy periods in direct provision centres. While the International Protection Act's scope did not extend to what is called direct provision, it deals with the application process and by extension those in direct provision centres and the length of time they will spend there. There have been calls for direct provision to be abolished, but these are consistently made in a context of an absence of any alternative system being proposed. As a Government responsible for protecting vulnerable people, we cannot leave them to their own devices or to some unspecified system that those who call for abolition have never set out a practical alternative. Regarding the operation of the direct provision centres, all contracts entered into by the Department follow approved tendering procedures. We would welcome applications from groups or organisations which have expressed great concerns about the standards in direct provision to submit their proposals to provide, run and manage such centres. As recently as last August, the Department invited expressions of interest from persons interested in providing accommodation and ancillary services for persons seeking asylum in the State. The Department continues to welcome such expressions of interest. It is my understanding an open, transparent and competitive tendering process will commence shortly for the management of State owned accommodation centres. For the information of the House, I have visited many of the centres - two in Waterford, three in Dublin, Mosney, Laois, Galway, two in Limerick, Clare, Mayo and Sligo; therefore, I know what I am talking about. The State funds the service providers and I reiterate once again that it is open to any group which feels a better service can be provided to make such a proposal and it will be processed properly through the approved tendering procedures. In the meantime, it is clear from the working group report that the current system has challenges that must be met, especially for those who rely on this accommodation and support for longer periods than planned. The working group was particularly concerned about the impact long-term institutional residency has on children. Many of the contributions here were made in terms of the impact it has on children, rightly so. The International Protection Act takes the reforming step of introducing a single application procedure which will significantly simplify the system of determination and allows for all information to be considered in the first instance without any dilution in best practice in proper procedures or due process. This delivers on the commitment given in the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016, "to legislate to reduce the length of time the asylum applicant spends in the asylum determination system and consequently in Direct Provision through the establishment of a single applications procedure", The Act is in compliance with the United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees and with the related EU directives on asylum procedures and qualification into which Ireland has opted. From the outset, the Department of Justice and Equality placed the "best interests of the child" at the centre of discussions with the Attorney General's office in preparing this Act and ensured this value was placed in a number of specific provisions of the published Bill. The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I repeatedly assured Oireachtas Members that this principle is at the heart of the Act and will be embedded in best practice in the protection process arising from the introduction of a new single application procedure. These matters were given careful scrutiny by the Council of State and the President signed the Bill into law on 30 December 2015. In the motion before the House Senators have rightly drawn attention to the context in which we operate. The Government through a referendum passed by the people have ensured children now have full constitutional protection. This Act must be read in the context of the constitutional obligations set out in Article 42A(1). It is also to be read in the context of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including Article 24(1) which states: "in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the child's best interests must be a primary consideration". I acknowledge the serious and helpful engagement of Senator Jillian van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance with departmental officials and their combined efforts to ensure children's best interests are protected in the Act and the protection system. This debate follows on from that co-operation. The Department, on publication of the International Protection Bill, set out its commitment in this area and ensured the "best interests of the child" was placed in sections 24, 35 and 57 in the original Bill presented to the Oireachtas. In the Seanad the Department introduced a further amendment requiring Tusla to consider legal advice, as well as its own information as to when a child in its care should become an applicant - section 15(4). As a result of the constructive engagements in both Houses and with NGOs which engaged with the Department, a number of further amendments were accepted by the Government to the Act to give further assurance as to the Government's bona fides on protecting children in the protection process. As a result, to offer further reassurance to advocates who rightly promote the best interests of the child, the "best interests principle" or child positive amendments have been incorporated in sections 15(4), 20(7), 24, 27, 35 and 52 to 57, inclusive. The Government has also provided more resources for the processing of applications in the system five years or more and there has been a noticeable acceleration in grants of status and in addressing legal challenges arising in respect of older applications in the current system. As Minister of State, during the summer, I completed the work of a task force designed to assist those granted status in leaving direct provision centres and I am pleased to report that despite accommodation pressures, 57% were found to be able to leave within three months and this rose to 86% within six months of being granted status. I confirm the statistics as outlined by Senator Marie Moloney. Since the publication of the report and because of the extra resources afforded to the Department in the last budget, between 60 and 80 people per month in direct provision centres are getting leave to remain. I add that more than 80 deportation orders have been revoked since publication of the report, which is welcome. This is considerable constructive activity and welcome to all in the protection system or who advocate on their behalf. The work is continuing and these matters are the subject of ongoing deliberations in the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy and public service reform. Important progress has been outlined above in implementing the report's recommendations notwithstanding the significant challenges faced by Ireland and the European Union arising from the migration crisis in the Mediterranean area occurring in the months following the report's publication. The Department is involved in an audit of progress on the implementation of recommendations to update the Cabinet sub-committee. The motion asks for updates on specific recommendations of the working group with which I will now deal. In response to the Senators' query on recommendation 5.30 that the direct provision weekly allowance for adults should be increased from €19.10 to €38.74 for adults and from €9.60 to €29.80 for children, I am pleased to inform the House that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, jointly sought and obtained Government approval to increase the weekly allowance to be paid to children by €6 earlier this month. This amounts to a more than 60% increase on the previous level, acknowledging that this allowance had not been increased since its introduction. These recommendations remain on the Cabinet sub-committee's agenda for further consideration. The changes are good, but I concede they are not good enough. The Minister for Health's implementation of the waiving of prescription charges has also eased another serious financial pressure on parents who had to meet those costs from their direct provision allowances. Senators referred to the potential oversight role of the Ombudsman for Children. I confirm to the House that the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is meeting the Ombudsman for Children next Wednesday to discuss this and other issues. In addition, I welcome the swift implementation by the Minister for Education and Skills of the working group's recommendations in regard to children living in direct provision accommodation to be supported to access third level education which positively impacted on children during this academic year. In regard to recommendation 3.263, the International Protection Act's implementation will involve a thorough review of all materials, guidelines and agreements to ensure best practice. Interviews with unaccompanied minors are conducted in specially designed child-friendly interview rooms in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, on Mount Street. A representative from the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, attends the interview with the child applicant and assists them throughout the whole asylum process, including helping them with their initial application and with explaining to them what to expect in the protection process. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal will become the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. To date the tribunal has not had any appeals from unaccompanied children or minors. The tribunal published a guideline on dealing with child applicants in the past year. This followed extensive consultation with various interested parties, including the Ombudsman for Children, and a two-day inter-agency training course on dealing with child applicants. The Legal Aid Board has an information leaflet, written in plain English, on the service it provides to asylum seekers. This leaflet is translated into various languages and is also contained on the board's website. The leaflets are made available to applicants in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on registration. Specialised legal information including early legal advice is given to all unaccompanied minors in the care of Tusla via a dedicated unit in the law centre in Smithfield. In regard to recommendation 4.199, the working group was fully aware that a welfare strategy was already in place both in terms of liaison structures and also in terms of individual case management. Tusla reports that a document outlining this strategy and a protocol governing same is being further developed jointly by themselves and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, which is responsible for the centres. This updated protocol will be available from mid-February. It is important that we be clear and that the working group was fully aware that Tusla and the RIA have had structures in place for several years to assist in collaboration on inter-agency communication, information and case management both in regard to the general population of children and families in direct provision centres and also with "aged out" unaccompanied minors. Their recommendation was designed to ensure his best practice would be embedded in the system and we are happy to offer such reassurance.This collaboration is achieved both through organised inter-agency meetings and on an ongoing basis in respect of individual case management. Tusla also advises that it is progressing the arrangement to identify a named social worker on its child protection team both internally within the line management structure and in collaboration with the HSE and the RIA. It is intended that there would also be a linkage between the child protection social worker and the social workers on the mental health and primary care teams with the staff member in each centre who is identified by the RIA as the designated officer for Children First. This arrangement will be put in place by mid-February. The HSE is in the process of strengthening links with its mental health division to ensure the mental health needs of people living in direct provision centres are adequately addressed. The HSE sits on a high level group chaired by the RIA comprising statutory representation from the Department of Social Protection, Tusla, etc., and it works collaboratively to address any issues emerging or that have been escalated. These agencies were represented on the working group and the HSE is working towards enhancing linkages across the operational system in order that there is a named person in each community health organisation to whom queries in respect of direct provision centres in that catchment area can be directed. In respect of recommendation 4.226, inspections of direct provision centres are carried out by the RIA and an independent contracted private company. These regular and unannounced inspections are made to ensure services provided for residents are satisfactory and that all health and safety requirements are being met. The services that each centre must provide for residents are also set out in the RIA house rules, which were revised around the same time the working group report was published and were distributed to all centres. A new complaints system was introduced by the RIA in 2015 allowing for complaints to be appealed to an independent officer. Complaints made since have been addressed locally and the appeal officer has not received any request to intervene. It is important to monitor the impact of these improvements and we are doing so as part of the report's consideration process. Establishing another inspectorate or extending the remit of an existing body to carry out inspections in direct provision centres will require further operational consideration. The establishment of any new body will naturally have resource implications while extending the remit of an existing body may necessitate a legislative change. For these reasons, this recommendation remains under active consideration and the officials in my Department will continue to explore the available options as to how this might be progressed. In respect of recommendation 4.135, I again note the progress being made by the RIA's new and more independent complaints system to swiftly address issues that arise. Extending the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children may also require a legislative change in addition to having resource implications for staffing levels in both offices to deal with the increased functions. Discussions between officials of my Department and the Office of the Ombudsman took place in December last. It is expected that similar discussions will take place with the Ombudsman for Children next Wednesday. I hope progress can be made quickly on this matter. In respect of recommendation 4.75, while the recommendation of the working group that we should provide all families with access to cooking facilities and their own private living space is certainly desirable, it is not easy to implement in the short term. The impact of a substantial increase in demand for accommodation which coincided with the publication of the working group's report cannot be understated. We have seen a 120% increase in protection applications in 2015 and with our acceptance of a further 4,000 applicants under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, IRPP, this has brought a further demand on the resources available in the market place to meet the needs of increasing numbers and our commitment to establish emergency reception and orientation centres for the new arrivals under the IRPP. We have no reason to believe this trend will not continue in this and in subsequent years. Reconfiguring the existing centres to provide communal kitchens and private living space at a time of rapidly increasing demand would, as I understand it, involve a significant restructuring of the property portfolio currently held by the RIA in the Department. It may also have the unintended consequence of reducing bed capacity at a time when the number of daily asylum applications being made in the country is increasing significantly. We must also acknowledge that there is a shortage of accommodation in the State generally which also impacts on our ability to tender for suitable accommodation which may need to be procured. It is important to note that 15 direct provision centres already provide access to a communal kitchen where residents can prepare their own meals and we are looking to extend and enhance such provisions, where possible. Four of these centres have their own self-contained catering units for each family. All accommodation centres have access to kitchenette facilities where residents can heat food or make tea and coffee. The Department is examining logistical solutions in respect of existing property and is consulting the Office of Government Procurement on the best approach to future tenders for direct provision accommodation. In considering changes to accommodation centres, special attention must also be paid to ensure continued compliance with all planning, health and safety and fire regulations, etc., as recommended in the report of the working group. It is clear progress is being made and that we are meeting the challenge to considerably reduce the time applicants are dependent on the system of direct provision for their needs by that ensuring a quality driven single application procedure - the most significant reform of the protection process in a decade - is deliverable through the International Protection Act. Meeting the needs of those in need of protection requires more than one-line solutions. The working group did a thorough job in recommending changes in key areas of the protection process, including direct provision and support services. Important progress has been made in six months, most especially in the key pillar of positive change and legislation for a fair and efficient single application procedure which addressed the matters raised by 26 of the working group's recommendations. I am confident that the current review of progress on the working group's recommendations being undertaken by my Department will yield further cross-departmental progress and that the ongoing deliberations by the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy and public service reform will agree more significant progress in an area which has been of concern to the Government. In initiating the first review of this area through a high level working group, delivering on implementation of its recommendations and in passing the single most important reform of the cumbersome sequential application procedure - the root of so many challenges in the protection process - we have been a Government the practical response of which to a system that has been unchanged for 15 years will yield progressive results in the years ahead. We are prioritising the delivery of a protection system which is fair and efficient, providing for the needs of those in need of our protection at a time of challenge and change which we must meet across Europe and beyond. It is to the eternal credit of this House that this issue has been constantly raised. I thank Members from all sides on behalf of the children and those living in direct provision centres for their tenacity in pursuing this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senators for raising this issue. When the history of it is written, Seanad Éireann and those in it who have advocated for children will be acknowledged. Those in direct provision centres will be thankful for what has been said. I remind Senators that the system was set up at a time when the people who came to this country seeking protection were living in parks and sleeping on benches, with no facilities available to them. That was the reason the direct provision system was established initially as a short-term measure. It should have been radically reviewed within five years, but during those five years there was a citizenship referendum which focused on those coming to the country from abroad. I ran for election for the very first time at the time of that citizenship referendum and it upset me. It was my first foray into politics and the emotions stirred at the time were quite despicable. This should have been done an awful long time ago. At the time we had 10,000 asylum applicants a year. That was the nature of the system trying to cope. The reality is that although we had a fantastic opportunity to do this a number of years ago when resources were available, it was not done. Now we find ourselves in a situation where we are trying to sort out the situation as numbers increase. In 2015 there were over 3,000 applicants, a doubling of the number the previous year. We have committed to accepting 4,000 refugees from the Syrian crisis. I never made a commitment to abolish this system and do not believe it can be abolished. Some Members of the House have said we should abolish the direct provision system and that there are alternatives being offered. I have not seen one that is viable. For me and people working in the Department who care about the issue deeply, abolishing the system would mean sticking 4,500 people on a housing list or asking them to find private rented accommodation for themselves. That is not a viable option. I would stand over a system in which people lived in an excellent centre for a number of months but not one in which they grew up or raised a family.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is the intent behind the reforms we are overseeing. The tragedy of direct provision, as with other aspects of public policy that have failed, is that a short-term measure becomes a long-term solution. When given responsibility for this area, I did not just want to read reports and engage with NGOs, but wanted to see, smell and taste the centres myself. I have seen, smelt and tasted the desperation in these centres and know exactly what is happening in them. However, NGOs now tell me they see a change. They see the letters being sent to people who have been in direct provision centres for over five years. They know that there is a sense of hope arising because of the report of the direct provision protection working group. Now they can see, because of the resources that have been put in by the Department of Justice and Equality in the most recent budget, that more people are getting leave to remain and more are moving out of the centres and building lives for themselves. Some 60 to 80 people a month are getting leave to remain and moving out of the centres There is a challenge in that regard because we had approximately 450 cases of people with leave to remain who were still in direct provision centres because they could not find accommodation elsewhere. We had approximately 18 cases of people who remained in direct provision centres for one year after they had obtained leave to remain. The solutions are not simple. However, I agree with Senator Jillian van Turnhout that it is about nudging and edging our way out from a catastrophic policy disaster towards providing individuals, families and children with a sense of hope and expectation. It is much more than throwing slogans around. It is actually dealing with situations humanely and properly.  I contend and agree with everybody here that permission to work, the right to work, permission for individual payment, the right to education and the right to prepare food are necessary. The right to prepare food may sometimes be dismissed as a trivial issue, but it is not. It is central to parenthood and central to how a child understands connectivity within the family. The working group's report is the only game in town. It is the only document on which anybody is working and is not sitting on a shelf but is live and being implemented. I would love to have the opportunity to come back after the general election to work with others in these Houses to ensure we implement the report because in this commemoration year, children living in direct provision centres need a commemoration that speaks of something better and brighter for their lives. I assure Senators this is happening on an incremental basis.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to address the House. I have just returned from Paris where I spent a few days and want to advise Members of this House that we should be very proud of the travelling supporters who are doing the country's name great service as supporters of the Republic of Ireland soccer team and also the supporters of the Northern Ireland soccer team in the European championship. I extend best wishes to them. I wish to raise two issues. I was taken aback by the response of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to Senator Lynn Ruane's Commencement matter today on the nature of addiction and drugs issues. It appears that the Minister is intending to separate the Misuse of Drugs Act into two pieces of legislation, which I do not think is necessary. What is needed in this House is a more elongated debate on the nature of addiction, drugs and drug crime and to put the issues on a proper footing, which would be in keeping with the international move towards decriminalisation and having a health rather than a criminal justice response.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On my second point, I stood in this House on a number of occasions as Minister of State and what impressed me most about it was that it stood and spoke with one voice. The House was never more powerful than it was on the issue of direct provision. I believe Members will know, regardless of their political background, that this House was very impressive and managed to move that debate onto a higher platform when Members all stood together and tried to move the issue along. Once again, I was very taken aback when I saw a deletion from the programme for Government. It was a line from the draft programme for Government which referred to implementation of the McMahon report. Many Members of this House had difficulties with the report and possibly felt it did not go far enough. They believe the direct provision system should have been abolished, but at least the McMahon report was the first proper report on the direct provision system in 15 years and it would have gone a long way towards helping the lives of those in the system. The recommendation made in the draft programme for Government that the McMahon report be implemented was deleted and does not feature in the actual programme for Government. I ask that the House again use its campaigning zeal to seek reform of the direct provision system. Collectively and regardless of political backgrounds, all Members believe these reforms and the McMahon report need to be implemented in full.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Today is Bloomsday. I note that Senator David Norris, a great Joycean scholar, has left the Chamber. I add my voice to that of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins on the status of the arts in Ireland, particularly with their perceived, if not real, downgrading from a Department structure perspective. There is the lack of a Minister of State with responsibility for the arts. One of the Taoiseach's nominees to this House five years ago, former Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, director of the Abbey Theatre, added greatly to the debate on the cultural importance of the arts sector to social and political life.That is also an omission. Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue of arts funding and the importance of the arts? This is the only country in the world that has a musical instrument as its national symbol. While we often view the arts and cultural life as being somewhat of a luxury, from my work in the equality field, I know that those on the edges of society often do not have any other means of expressing the lives they lead and their trials and tribulations. The only way they can do so is through the arts.  Following on from what Senator Catherine Ardagh outlined, there is quite a level of unease and disquiet on the issue of waste charges. I heard on radio this morning that the Minister intended to meet various private sector companies next week to discuss the issue. It would be a good idea to have a calm debate on the floor of the House because when there is a vacuum, fears can be raised. As Senator Catherine Ardagh rightly said, people have fears about how they can meet bills as the situation continues.  I hope we can progress the issue of the arts and their importance to the country. I also hope we can have clarity on the issue of waste charges. To this end, we should invite the relevant Ministers to come to the House to further the debate.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his elevation to his new role and congratulate the Minister on her appointment. As anybody who has run a primary school will find running a Department to be very easy, I wish the Minister the best of luck. Comments have been made in the Chamber on how, statistically, we have done much better in recent years in bringing down the unemployment rate, which obviously is to be welcomed. In that time the previous Government also managed to provide many protections for workers' rights. It not merely increased the national minimum wage twice, but I also refer to the reintroduction of the joint labour committee, JLC, system, the employment regulation orders, EROs, and collective bargaining legislation. Consequently, a threshold of decency was provided for in the economy. However, I remind the Minister of the Private Members' motion that was passed by Dáil Éireann only two weeks ago. It was in the name of the Labour Party and written by Senator Gerald Nash who did a huge amount of work in the Minister's Department in the previous Government. The motion reads:That Dáil Éireann:affirms that, as economic conditions continue to improve, it will stand up for working people and ensure that employees secure a fair share of growing national prosperity;accordingly calls for a programme of incremental increases to the national minimum wage until it is pegged at 60% of median earnings, and for a living wage of €11.50 per hour to be adopted throughout the public sector;believes that, alongside tackling low pay, we must address the root causes of insecurity at work, commit to further protections for vulnerable workers in precarious employment and bring an end to exploitative employment contracts that foster increased casualisation of workers;calls therefore on the Government to prepare and introduce a legislative package that will protect and enhance workers’ rights by:- ending the abuse of "if and when" contracts;- combating bogus self-employment;- ensuring freelance workers have the right to collectively bargain;- extending the transfer of undertakings regulations, TUPE, to workers in services such as catering and security;- protecting workers in "informal" insolvencies and collective redundancies;- providing statutory redress for the victims of workplace bullying;- promoting employment standards and the living wage in public procurement; and- preventing unilateral reductions in pay;notes in particular the University of Limerick report to the Government, Study on the Prevalence of Zero Hour Contracts among Irish Employers and their Impact on Employees, and, commissioned following the outrageous treatment of Clerys workers in June 2015, the Cahill-Duffy Expert Examination and Review of Laws on the Protection of Employee Interests When Assets are Separated from the Operating Entity; andcommends the recommendations set out in both reports and calls on the Government as an urgent priority to prepare legislation for their implementation.As the Minister is aware, the motion was passed by the Dáil, the main House of the Oireachtas. I would like to hear her comments on it because I may have misheard, but I have been led to believe she is not minded to accept the report from the University of Limerick. If that were the case, it would fly in the face of the expressed will of Dáil Éireann and what is right and just, particularly given that the Clerys workers are this week marking the first anniversary of their disgraceful treatment. I will touch on the issue of dignity of work and how work is so important for those in the vulnerable sectors of society, which is often forgotten about in the economic debate. During the turbulent time when unemployment levels crept up it was often said unemployment cost the Exchequer €27,000 for every person unemployed, including the loss of VAT receipts and welfare payments, but this completely misses the point. It is the loss of dignity and self-worth that is the major deficit caused by unemployment. There are sections of society that are not necessarily benefiting from the Action Plan for Jobs. During the Celtic tiger period more than 100,000 people were in consistent unemployment. Whatever action plan the Government comes up with and whatever efforts are made to reduce unemployment, they do not seem to permeate into every sector of society. The comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities should have been part of the Action Plan for Jobs, but during the tenure of the last Government the Department did not really want to know about the strategy which effectively was run as an equality measure within the Department of Justice and Equality. That is disappointing because if one looks at certain sectors of society such as those living in disadvantaged areas, members of the Traveller community, people with disabilities and migrants, one can see that there are particular barriers and issues that they face in gaining employment, being protected in work and ensuring their employment rights are enhanced. In the context of that comprehensive employment strategy, perhaps the Department might again look at how it can engage with and drive it and be more positive about it because when I was involved in putting it together, I felt the engagement of the Department was less than positive.  I wish the Minister well in what she is trying to do. The threshold of decency is everything. Having statistics that we can roll out and being able to say unemployment has come down are laudable and all very well, but dignity in work and the threshold of decency in the economy are everything. Workers' rights and the sense of dignity a worker has every morning in getting up and going to work are what keeps society together. I reiterate my request to the Minister that she deal in a positive manner with the Labour Party motion that was passed in the Dáil with the support of other parties two weeks ago.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Ivana Bacik, Kevin Humphreys and the entire Labour Party group in the Seanad, in expressing our condolences to the family of the late Jo Cox, MP. I am keen to emphasise what she believed in, which is far more important than what the person who murdered her believed in. She was a person who believed in the human dignity of all individuals, regardless of who they were or from where they came. This is something on which we should reflect because often in Irish society and public discourse we tend to label people and undermine their humanity. This leads to inequality, prejudice and fear. It is important that anyone who is thinking of entering politics, especially young women, be inspired by Jo Cox and not fearful of what happened to her. We live in an era in which there is harsh public discourse. Sometimes it is difficult to get across a nuanced point of view. Some political campaigns can be quite nasty and personalised. Elements of the media are intent on degrading politics and the public discourse in which we engage. It is important that anyone listening to those of us in this House, the other House or any parliament throughout the world should agree that politics can be the noblest of causes. For a person to follow a campaign and believe in something so vehemently that he or she is willing to spend his or her life or career in pursuit of that aim is good and decent. We must protect public discourse and those who wish to engage in it with everything we can.  I again join my colleagues in expressing sympathy. I am keen to reassure young men and women who believe in politics that the beliefs and values of Jo Cox will win out.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well in her endeavours. It is a positive to have a Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy with the background she has, that she has no other responsibilities and that this issue will be her main focus. The Bill arises from the High Court case of March 2015. We have, therefore, been waiting for this legislation for over a year. I agree with Senator Lynn Ruane's overall remarks that this legislation flies in the face of what every other western democracy seems to be moving towards - decriminalising the addict and the user and focusing attention on the pusher and those who benefit and profit from the drugs trade. I do not believe having legislation that criminalises someone for possession of an illegal substance does anything for that individual. In the debate I have heard words such as "zombies". Other words are used in media to describe people with an addiction. A number of months ago two individuals died from a heroin overdose within a couple of hundred yards of each other, one in the toilets of Connolly Station, while the other, a man, was found after being exposed to the open air for a number of nights. They did not make the news. There was no march, petition, public outcry or media interest. At some level collectively, we seem to have decided that addicts are the authors of their own misfortune and, therefore, that their deaths are somehow self-inflicted. If we continue with that narrative, we are destined to repeat the failures of the past. I do not believe it should be a criminal offence for a person to be caught in possession of something to which he or she is addicted. That is a waste of Garda time. I also do not believe this legislation should separate the issue of injecting centres. In my previous role as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I felt I had gone a long way down the road towards getting cross-party agreement on the part of the Bill relating to injecting centres. It had been passed by the Cabinet and was due to be included in the Bill. With the best will in the world, I do not understand why it has been separated to be dealt with at a later stage. It does not make any sense. My suspicion is that the responsibility of the Government to react to the High Court case of March 2015 is foremost in the minds of those in the Department, the Minister of State and the Government and that any progressive, forward-thinking way of tackling the drugs issue has to take second place. I am concerned and hope the Minister of State can dampen these concerns and reassure me that the Government will give the same priority to the injecting centre model as it is to this legislation. However, it is very disappointing that the issue has been separated it out. If we reinforce what we have always done, we will always get what we have always had. People have always taken drugs and it is quite likely that they always will. To demonise and criminalise someone with an addiction problem is, in many respects, to criminalise marginalisation. A disproportionate number of those who engage in drug misuse come from areas of social disadvantage and are people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, migrants and Travellers. Statistically, it can be proved that the further people are disconnected from the mainstream of Irish society, the more likely they are to be sucked into addiction. When we criminalise the possession of substances for personal use to feed a drug misuse habit and an addiction, we are criminalising marginalisation. That is effectively what we are doing. I invite the Minister of State to go to the drug court, if she has not done so already. It is a good initiative with limited success. Effectively, what one sees there is a bunch of sick people sitting in a courtroom. Sick people do not belong in a courtroom; they belong in a medical facility. It is pointless in the extreme to continually suggest the solution to the drugs problem in Ireland is a criminal justice one. It is not; it is a health solution. We will eventually come to the conclusion that what has been done in Portugal is a much more humane and potentially successful approach because it puts the needs of the addict at the centre of public policy and does not dehumanise him or her by using words such as "zombie" or terminology that others in the media use openly and without censure, effectively categorising him or her as being little more than junk. While my party and I are happy to see the Bill progress to Committee Stage, I am disappointed at the separating out of injecting centres. This move feeds my suspicion that the commitment to them is not as strong within the Government as it was in the previous one, notwithstanding the Minister of State's personal commitment to deal with the issue. I have no difficulty with controlling substances and continuing to control substances that are causing intense harm. However, if we continue to criminalise the possession of substances to which people are addicted, because their bodies are crying out for them, we will continue along the road that has led to so much hurt. There were 679 drug and alcohol-related deaths in Ireland in 2013. Not all of them were drug-related. Many were traffic related and many were suicides. Everybody in this Chamber should ask why he or she did not hear about the two individuals who had died from a heroin overdose in a toilet in a train station and a few hundred yards away on Foley Street only three months ago. It may be because we continually blame the person who is the victim.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the Leas-Chathaoirleach sure?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join with Senator Ó Clochartaigh on two points. He has previously asked for a debate on the Irish language in this House and that is something we should definitely have in the coming weeks. Will the Leader arrange it? It is an important debate. I say that deliberately in English because it is a debate for all Members of this House. We should be inclusive about the discussion on the status of our native language. I also join with him in congratulating the Irish team which came back from the European Championship yesterday. I am delighted that we are having a debate later today about Brexit because, just when we feel the world is falling apart somewhat, sport can always cheer us up. In particular, the Icelandic football team last night gave us all great reason to cheer another "Brexit" that was perhaps not expected. We should have a debate on sport. It may be that it enters our political consciousness only at times of great competition or achievement, but sport means a huge amount to people throughout the country. It brings people together and provides a fantastic opportunity for communities to come together. It can be an opportunity for those on the edges of society to participate. It reflects well on us. Given the great achievements of the Irish soccer team as well as the Northern Irish soccer team in the European Championship, perhaps now is the time to have cold reflection on the state of the game of football in Ireland, including the League of Ireland, the women's game, the under age game, the game throughout the island, and where we go from here. Participating in sport is about representing one's town, place and parish, and there is an awful lot to be positive about. What can the political circle do in terms of investment or strategy for the next five, ten or 15 years? I am thinking of the volunteers throughout the country who line the pitches, put up the nets and take the training sessions for the under-7s and under-8s. These are the real heroes when it comes to participation in sport in Ireland. Could we have a debate in the coming weeks with either the senior Minister or the junior Minister in the Department to see what support we can give to develop football and other sports in Ireland over the coming years? The potential for an all-Ireland team has been mentioned, which is something I think I would support. There are other strategic things we could do in the short term with regard to an all-Ireland league when comes to progressing football in Ireland. Sport is not an add-on or a luxury. It is integral to the life of people in Ireland. People get excited about it, and if people get excited about it it has to be considered important. I suggest that the House have at an appropriate time a debate on sport and discuss exactly what can be done in the long term and in a strategic fashion to support and promote games of whatever kind in Ireland.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister for this important debate. The vote by the British people is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. I have not been as depressed about a political event in a considerable time. It proves that if one decides to focus one's attention on a disenfranchised or disconnected group of people and tells them anything one wishes to conjure up in one's head and point at another group of people and say they are the problem, one can secure a political win.I fear for politics internationally. Austria came within an ace of electing a far-right President. We can see in America and even here that the centre ground is being hollowed out and the people and the political discourse are going to the far left and far right. It seems anything can be said and a victimhood mentality rules the day across Europe and in Ireland. Much of the debate centred on immigration. People in this House do not have any right to be sniffy or to pretend that such a debate could not happen here in Ireland. The very first election I ran in was the local election in 2004 which coincided with an unnecessary referendum on citizenship promoted by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and supported by Fine Gael which brought out some pretty nasty emotions. We have not had any general election centred on the issue of immigration but let us not pretend that cannot happen in the future because it happened on that occasion.  I worry about the European project because it was a collection of European nations standing together to collectively face the issues of the world, issues that affect the global South, climate change and the refugee crisis, for example. The British people have effectively said they want to turn their back on those issues. How can we now face these world issues collectively and effect some change? It is devastating and disappointing that this has come to pass. British politics is in terminal decline. Both mainstream parties are in a massive state of disintegration. Now is the time for us, while talking about commerce, trade, tariffs, exports and imports, and financial considerations to do so on a humanitarian basis. The EU was founded because the people of Europe said they could not let the continent descend into war again but we have returned to a situation where extremist rhetoric is winning the day, where the emotions of people who feel disaffected with mainstream society can be stirred up and a faceless enemy can be identified and becomes the basis for a political win. Victimhood is winning the day. There are very serious questions to be answered and reflection to be had about what we stand for in this Republic. If the only rhetoric we come up with is based on tariffs and trade, economics and money, we have missed the point because the European project was born out of a sense of despair about where humanity was going. I have that sense of despair now so can we please readjust our rhetoric to talk about humanity and our collective response to the global issues of the day and stand up for what is decent and right? Ireland is in a particularly good place to do that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are very few issues in public policy that I feel more strongly about than this. I was in the position of the Minister of State not that long ago. In public life, it is very rare to come to the conclusion that everything we are doing is wrong. We have come to the conclusion that the issue with drugs lies with the substances and that if we just control them, everything will be fine. Addiction, however, is not just about the substance, it is about circumstances, disconnection and marginalisation. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we still think it is a good idea to effectively criminalise marginalisation and addiction.What my amendment is trying to achieve - it is very similar to Senator Ruane's amendment - is to stand by what the programme for Government said that drug policy would take a health-centred approach and not a criminal justice one. It makes absolutely no sense to try to dissuade somebody from a life of addiction by criminalising him or her for his or her drug use. My amendment clearly states that it should be a defence for anybody caught in possession of an illegal substance to argue that it was for his or her own personal use. As Senator Ruane has quite correctly said, Ireland could follow the example of Portugal by saying to individuals that we understand they are addicted, they have a medical need and that they need help and compassion and that we are not going to blame the victim. What happens in this Republic is that we blame the victim and all the resources that could be spent dealing with the pushers and the trade are being spent on the victims of the trade. There are silent victims of this industry who nobody ever hears about. I mentioned in the House a couple of weeks ago that in March of this year two people were found dead on the streets of our capital city from heroin overdoses but that never made it into the newspapers. One gentleman was found dead in the public toilet of Connolly Station and another gentleman was found dead after two nights in the open air in Foley Street. The stories did not make it into any newspaper, there was no protest and there was no political comment about it because on some level, in this society, we have decided that these people are to blame for their own addiction. We blame the victim and criminalise the victim. If one speaks to any group from the equality sector, whether the LGBT community, the Traveller community, people with disabilities or migrants, they will all say that there is disproportionate drug usage issue in these communities because of disconnection and marginalisation. When a person falls into addiction, surely our response should not be a criminal justice one but a health one. I am not sure if the Minister of State has been to the Drug Treatment Court, which is an initiative to try to keep people away from the criminal justice system, but all one sees there is a bunch of sick people sitting in a court room. It makes no sense whatsoever. Fundamentally, what we are trying to achieve here is to ensure the victim of this trade, the addict or the drug user, is not a criminal because of his or her drug use. The people who sell, trade in and profit from drugs should be criminalised. They should be taken out of circulation and we should use the criminal justice system to do that. However, the victim, the addict or the user, should not be criminalised because of his or her medical need or medical condition. What we propose is common sense. It would shift the whole drugs issue away from a moralising pathetic attempt to say Ireland is black and white to actually humanise the individual who is affected by this. I refer to our friends in the media. We, in Ireland, constantly use terminology that dehumanises people who need services and resources, and the media is culpable in this. We call them names; we call them junk. When we do that it inevitably results in the public consciousness believing that, in some way, these people are less worthy of resources. Let us take a course of action that might actually work because what we are doing at the moment is not working. We should look at what they do in Portugal and we should say to citizens that they have an addiction and they are not criminals but that they are patients with a medical need and we will treat them as such.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I understand that we are taking Report Stage tomorrow. I withdraw my amendment on the basis that I shall resubmit it tomorrow on Report Stage. Therefore, I give the Minister of State 24 hours to consider my amendment. I am a bit taken aback by Fianna Fáil's suggestion that unnamed community groups are jumping up and down because they have been upset by this proposal. That is not the case for the groups that I have dealt with such as Citywide, the USI and Peter McVerry. The political parties in both Houses have changed their position all of the time such as the Green Party, People Before Profit and AAA. Also, the justice committee of these Houses, as indicated by the Minister of State herself, also supports this position.I am not convinced that we will have this conversation at a later stage because the legislation was also supposed to include the provision for medically-supervised injection centres and that measure has been separated from the Bill. I do not accept the suggestion either that the Bill is a response to what is happening in the north inner city because the Bill before us is a reaction a year later to the High Court case of March 2015. I do not accept the suggestion that the Bill is motivated by the recent murder spree in the north inner city because it is a response to a legislative need arising, as I indicated, from a High Court ruling. It is not acceptable to constantly state we can have the conversation some other time. I got support from the Minister of State’s colleagues in Cabinet in the previous Government. The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was very supportive of the idea to have injection centres. The initiative was passed by the Cabinet and was to be included in the Bill before the House but it has been separated and we will have to deal with it another time. The Minister of State indicated the Bill would be likely to come before us in the autumn. She said we would deal with decriminalisation at some other stage. There were 679 drug and alcohol-related deaths in 2013. Addicts have very limited access in terms of having a voice. What Senator Ruane, Senator Black and others have said is that it is surely a humane approach - that in the cold light of day in a courtroom situation, it should be a defence for somebody to admit to being an addict and that he or she is in possession of drugs because of the addiction. I am sure any prosecuting garda, judge or jury would be able to make a determination that the nature of the addiction is a reasonable defence for the individual. To reinforce what we have always done because we have always done it does not stand up to scrutiny. I will press the amendment on Report Stage tomorrow. I urge the Minister of State to reflect on her position between now and then. I also ask those Members who have spoken against the amendment to think again about it and perhaps to re-engage with people who know what they are talking about. I mentioned the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign, Fr. Peter McVerry, and the report that was done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. USI has again come out in favour of the decriminalisation of drug use. We are not resiling from the ideal of a drug-free society. That is absolutely not the case, but what we want is for it to be realised that somebody with an addiction needs help, support, compassion and medical attention, and does not need to be sitting in a courtroom or have a criminal conviction because of the nature of his or her medical need.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will resubmit it tomorrow.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 2:In page 5, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:
“Possession of controlled drugs for personal use
8. Notwithstanding anything in the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2015, in any proceedings for an offence under those Acts it shall be a defence to prove that the defendant had in his or her possession a controlled drug for his or her personal use and for no other purpose.”.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No. I will withdraw it with a view to resubmitting it on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. I am genuinely delighted by his appointment. I also welcome the officials from the Department with whom I worked. One of the reasons I changed my mind about the validity of this Chamber - which Senator Norris will be delighted to hear - relates to the issue of direct provision. When I was Minister of State, it was the collective will of the people in this Chamber that something should be done about the issue. I was greatly impressed by the campaigning zeal of Senators across the Chamber to ensure that something practical could be done. In fairness to the Houses of the Oireachtas, unlike other parliaments in Europe, when legislation such as the International Protection Bill 2015 and other issues relating to direct provision are brought before the Houses for discussion, the amendments and questions put down in this Chamber and in the Dáil are always on the humanitarian side, never on the conservative side. In the case of the legislation to which I refer, an amendment to try to restrict access or play the race card was never tabled. We should take comfort from that without being complacent about it. There is a collective will in the Houses, across all parties, to do the right thing, which is to be commended. The International Protection Act 2015 envisages that any new applicant for asylum in Ireland would be dealt with in a speedy manner - within six to nine months - through a single procedure mechanism in order to ensure that we do not have people in our asylum system for years on end. Much has been done recently to deal with direct provision. Many have been moved out of the system. There was a logjam and people were not able to get out - even when they had leave to remain in the country - to access housing and other services. I was genuinely horrified when I read the programme for Government. When I read the draft programme, I was delighted to see a commitment to implement the working group report. Many people think the report does not go far enough. It does not end direct provision. I do not believe we can end direct provision because when we go beyond the one line hashtag of "#end direct provision" and dig deeper into the situation, we have to remind ourselves of what happened 15 years ago when direct provision was initiated because asylum seekers here were effectively homeless and without services. Direct provision was created as a short-term measure but, as happens sometimes in Irish public policy, a short-term measure became a long-term reality. The system that was envisioned as lasting for six months remained in place for ten and then 12 years. Children are growing up in this system. I visited 13 of these centres - some better than others - across Ireland. I could envisage myself spending time in some, in others I would not spend a night. There is one in Waterford that particularly sticks in my mind and we are overseeing this. We should have a system that has excellent facilities, with proper oversight, with food preparation that is culturally sensitive, where children can play and people have community links and stay for a maximum of six months. The working group report contained the same vision. The Minister of State’s officials signed off on it. The reason I was horrified was that the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which engaged in that process took a risk to come inside the door to work with officials and sign off on proposals that could be implemented. They were implementable because the officials signed off on them, from a right to work, to food, to education, to health care, etc. One NGO walked away. The rest stayed in the system and with the process and signed off on the report in order to try to have it implemented. The draft programme for Government stated that it would be implemented but in the actual programme, that line was deleted. Somebody said this line about implementing the report - which Department officials had stood over and which NGOs had taken a great risk to be involved in to protect possibly the most vulnerable children in the State - had to be deleted. I would love to know who said that. It was not the Minister of State because this predated his appointment. Somebody in the political system or the Department decided this report could not be implemented in full. I want to know why because everybody took a risk. Why would any decent NGO trying to make a difference by working with the system engage with the Department of Justice and Equality again?Why, if another working group was set up to deal with any issue, would an NGO come inside the tent, take a risk and do the hard work - in some cases for nine months - to then sign off on a report for a Government which produces a programme for Government that initially states it will implement the report but then deletes the line? Somebody went out of his or her way to delete that line.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am horrified that somebody did that. If the Government does not want to implement it, it should say why. People took great risks. Some people in the Chamber were not happy with the report and did not feel it went far enough, but it is something about which I feel very strongly. I walked into the centres, and could smell the desperation and see people who were genuinely broken and were looking to public policy makers to make a difference. A document was then produced, which was greatly maligned in some quarters but had a chance to change lives, and somebody somewhere decided the line had to go. I am not in any way questioning the bona fides of the Minister of State. The Labour Party is happy to support the Bill. However, the working group report has to be the only game in town. The commitment of the Minister of State to that would be greatly appreciated.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want the record of the House to reflect my remarks properly because I was misquoted by the Minister of State.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Certain comments were read out during the debate and attributed to me when I was Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy. I refer specifically to remarks I made in a speech in London. I advise the Minister of State that it may be useful not to use speeches that have been written for her. In my previous role as Minister of State, I rarely read out a speech that had been written for me. The tone of some of the comments made by the Minister of State, which clearly had been written for her, could have been a little more generous. I thank Senators, including Independents, Sinn Féin and Green Party speakers, for the support they have shown me and Senator Lynn Ruane. Senator Ruane and I have tried to change drug policy to ensure it can effect change rather than reinforce the mistakes of the past. I was disappointed by the conservative consensus reached between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties, which consistently regurgitated an old drugs policy that has been seen to fail. I appeal to Senators from across the House who succeeded in speaking with one voice on a number of issues not to engage in a knee-jerk reaction to the drugs issue based on what they believe most people will respond favourably towards. This debate has been another missed opportunity. By criminalising people for having an addiction, we will ensure they have fewer rights than others. I wish the 10,000 people in the State who are in methadone maintenance programmes and the 20,000 people who are suffering from heroin addiction were protesting on the streets outside Leinster House. Perhaps if we had the numbers protesting outside that protested on other issues, Members would think differently about the rights and opportunities of people with addictions and the types of lives such persons are entitled to lead. I accept the Minister of State's bona fides and I know she is passionate about this issue. She gave the House a commitment to return to the issue of medically supervised injecting centres in the autumn. She and other speakers referred to the Portuguese model. If she is serious about this issue, she should adopt this model in the autumn. It was a mistake on her part to restate the position that the criminalisation of addiction is the correct approach.  I reiterate that the comments the Minister of State attributed to me were taken from a speech that was written on my behalf but which I did not use. I advise her to take her own counsel in deciding whether to use speeches that have been written for her because people will put words she should not use into her mouth. Her beliefs, background and sense of social justice will speak volumes to people who are hanging on every word she says. Those who are suffering from addiction and their families need much more from this Chamber than we have provided today.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I refer to the Admissions Bill, as published yesterday by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton. I understand the Bill will be brought before the House in due course, but I wish to raise a matter of concern. There seems to be a level of confusion regarding the processes surrounding the Bill and that some of the issues would be dealt with in the committee, according to the Minister, or a committee being set up within a committee. The committees appear to deal with some issues surrounding admissions to schools, while other will be dealt with by legislation. There is also confusion as to whether the Minister intends to tackle the school tie issue, by which some schools in the State insist on keeping their intergenerational, hierarchical bloodline in place to demand priority be given to children of past pupils, which, of course, discriminates against those who are from outside the area or those of a family background of parents who possibly did not attend secondary school. I ask the Leader to facilitate a discussion in this House with the Minister, understanding, of course, that the legislation will be brought before this House in due course. I know, however, that the Bill was a source of great tension in the last Government. It did not reach any agreement between the two parties in government last time. It is now the intention of the Minister to bring the issue forward. I am slightly confused and concerned, however, as to why some of the issues surrounding school admissions are being dealt with in a committee and some through legislation and at the same time what was considered to be a very minor change proposed by the Labour Party a number of weeks ago in the Dáil was voted down by a conservative consensus of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to discuss the proposal to move the Members of the Seanad to the National Museum of Ireland. I have been contacted by people who work in the museum who referred to the lack of communication on the future plans for this Chamber. They are aggrieved that requests for finance in previous years in order to upgrade the facilities in the National Museum of Ireland were put to one side. They believe the cultural heritage and arts communities have been affected disproportionately by the downturn in the economy and the decisions made by various Governments. Now they are aggrieved that investment in the museum is being made to benefit the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the museum.There is a great deal of misinformation on whether this House will decamp to the National Museum of Ireland for one year, two years or three years and on what curtailment there will inevitably be of the exhibitions that can be held and outreach programmes undertaken by the museum. If this House is to move, as proposed, the communication lines need to be better. Perhaps the Leader might ask the Minister with responsibility for this area, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to come to the House for a debate on the issue which I am sure is of interest to most Senators. We do not want to be encroaching on another part of the wider campus, uninvited and unwelcome, without ensuring the transition is as smooth as possible and will not overly inhibit the facilities already in place. There is a wider discussion to be had about the stature of the arts, culture and heritage. This would be an opportune time for the Leader to invite the Minister to the Seanad for a debate on the future plans for sittings of this House.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for being here. I very much appreciate it in the light of her responsibility for mental health services. I know that it is an individual case and that people in her position do not like discussing such cases. However, this is a particular case and I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise it. It concerns Igor Baker, whose father is in the Visitors Gallery. We are talking about a young man who has been tragically let down by the State since he arrived in Ireland. He was misdiagnosed at the age of 13 years as having schizophrenia, but he never had the condition. This young man suffers from autism and has been residing at the Ashlin Centre in Beaumont Hospital since 30 September 2015. He has violent tendencies and his parents cannot care for him adequately in the family home. Beaumont Hospital realised this, as did every doctor who came into contact with the family. The Minister of State will know that sometimes one comes across these cases where a family is looking for a place. There is a residential unit somewhere and the family wants to either obtain a place or get onto the list for a place. We do our best in those individual circumstances. What strikes me about this case - this is the reason I am raising it - is that everybody involved accepts that this young man cannot live at home. His parents have done their best for him. The Ashlin Centre admitted this young man on 30 September 2015 and he still lives there voluntarily. If he were to walk out onto the street tomorrow morning, there is nothing the hospital or the centre could do to stop him. There is a place for this young man at the newest centre in Kildare; therefore, the issue appears to be funding. That the State, through the Ashlin Centre, is keeping this young man does not make any sense. Why can this funding not be used to give him some chance in a much more appropriate setting at the newest centre? There seems to be a well meaning conspiracy of convenience. Everybody knows what needs to be done and that what this young man is going through is not appropriate for his needs. English is not his first language. He needs a sustainable, long-term care plan. I do not know how the other people who live at the newest centre got in there in the first instance. Obviously, they have situations that are similar to that of Igor Baker but funding was acquired to allow them to live at that centre. I cannot think of any case in my political career where everybody agrees what should happen but there seems to be a blockage somewhere. What is it that has permitted the State to allow Igor to remain in Beaumont Hospital, effectively on a day-to-day basis, since 30 September 2015, but that does not allow it to give him, his family and the people who love him the opportunity to access long-term care in a setting that is appropriate to his needs? Obviously, the answer is money but why are we spending so much money to keep him in Beaumont Hospital instead of giving him the chance he needs to live the life he deserves to live in this country surrounded by people who can care for him appropriately and satisfy his family that he is being cared for appropriately?  I know that departmental officials will say it is an individual case and that they do not like discussing such cases. However, I think the Minister of State will agree that this is a particularly unusual one. The Baker family are private people who do not necessarily want their private matters discussed on the airwaves. They appeared on the Claire Byrne show a number of months ago when the case was discussed. They do not necessarily want this case raised on the floor of the Seanad, the Dáil or anywhere else. They just want a solution. I appeal to the Minister of State to agree with me that what has been done with this young man is inappropriate and we need to find a more appropriate and sustainable solution for him and his family. I would be interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister of State's comments and her offer to meet me and hope the family also will be well received. I understand what she is saying in that the fact money has been spent in this area does not mean it can easily be shifted over but from her answer, she will certainly agree with me that everybody involved in this case agrees that where he is currently residing is not suitable for him. His family cannot care for him in the family home. He is a strong young man. He is 23 years of age and has a history of violent outbursts. His parents are at the end of their tether in this regard. Everybody agrees this is the case and I believe the Minister of State agrees with it too. I know that it is an individual case and the Minister of State cannot do this for everybody, but she will agree with me that this is a particularly unusual and deserving case. If she can find a mechanism for me, her and possibly the Minister of State with special responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, to sit down with the family and go to the next stage, it would be greatly appreciated. The family would greatly appreciate her intervention.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senators for tabling the motion which the Labour Party is obviously delighted to support. It is a very interesting debate. I am sure the Minister will agree that the expertise in this Chamber is quite remarkable, from the campaigning sector to parents. Senator Grace O'Sullivan's contribution was quite impressive. There are former local authority members and a former Minister with responsibility for housing in the Seanad also. It adds great weight to the debate. In general terms, I wish to say that, like all issues when dealing with people with disabilities, we, unfortunately, tend to compartmentalise the issues. I know this from my experience as a Minister of State in the last Government when dealing with the employment issue. The tendency was to view issues of people with disabilities as separate from the mainstream. That is a mistake. Employment is important and housing is important, regardless of how crises come and go. There is a tendency in Irish public policy to aim to sort out the mainstream crisis or emergency first and then to deal with these supposed issues, which are characterised as side-issues, but are really central to the entire debate. It was a disappointment for me and to people in the sector when we saw that An Action Plan for Jobs did not include a more comprehensive set of proposals for every sector of society. As Senator Gabrielle McFadden rightly said, this comes down to issues of empowerment and identity. What is more important to one's identity than the job one does or where one lives? It is central to our aim of getting away from the charitable view of people with disabilities towards a more rights-focused and rights-centred approach to the entire area. I know that the Minister is grappling with this issue as a new person in the job and that he intends to publish his action plan for housing next week. Even at this late stage, I implore the Minister to insert into that action plan a section dedicated to housing for people with disabilities because we have had a litany of failures. This goes beyond governmental records going back over the years which have been previously mentioned. People have mentioned what local authorities have done and do not do. I will give two points in terms of the local authorities' response. Senator Victor Boyhan mentioned local authority members. It is legitimate to say it is not good enough for local authority members to complain about a lack of resources coming from central government when they are beating down the door in order to reduce the property tax in their own local area by 15% which would be a perfectly adequate funding mechanism to supply housing for various sectors of society that need it.Voting that down by 15% is their power, but they then complain about a lack of resources. If we are going to be serious about the services we want local councillors to supply in their local authority areas, they must take the responsibility seriously and deliver for those who need it most. There must be understanding in the wider society about the necessity for housing because when it comes to housing for people on the edges of society which could include Traveller accommodation or people with addiction, mental health or disability issues, there will regularly be a reaction from residents' groups and communities. I am quite sure everybody in this room involved with politics has been to meetings where statements are made that in the fullness of time might embarrass the speakers. Everybody wants solutions to the homelessness crisis or for homelessness to be resolved but they do not want it done necessarily on their doorstep. Everybody feels there should be appropriate accommodation for Travellers but not near them, thank you very much. Everybody feels we should have proper accommodation for people with disabilities or mental health challenges but not near them. After the election I attended a public meeting in my constituency relating to a 68-unit development. Some of the statements made in that room made me feel I was at a meeting somewhere in the Deep South, perhaps Alabama, in the 1950s, with pitchforks being wielded. One woman stood up to say she had never been ashamed to live in the community where she resides until she sat in that room that night. There were 250 people in a packed room because they were upset at the suggestion there would be 68 social housing units in their community. We can compare that with the public outcry over homelessness and the housing crisis or the rhetoric coming from local authority members who vote to reduce the local property tax by 15%. There is a collective responsibility across all sectors, including politics and those with responsible leadership positions in their own communities, to be part of the solution. I wish the Minister every success. None of us in the Chamber - certainly no one in my party - intends in any way to be obstructionist or score political points on an issue such as this. There are practical solutions to be found. Issues relating to the elderly have been suggested. I met a group recently talking about dead space in areas where senior citizens reside more densely, as there may be cases in which one person resides in a four-bedroom house. We discussed how the local authority could renovate a portion of such houses to facilitate rental income for the person, who could use it to adapt another part of the house, thus allowing the dead space, through a funding mechanism, to refurbish the other space. This would allow us to move away from the idea that a single person in later years in a four-bedroom house must find a smaller unit. People have neighbours and contacts and may not want to move. There are innovative ways of different groups coming together to try to find solutions to the problems we face. The expertise in this room is quite remarkable. Many motions coming before this and the other House are sometimes provocative for the sake of it, but this is a comprehensive, well thought out and detailed motion that will benefit the Minister. The message must go out to local authorities to do the job they have to do but also that local authority members must take responsibility for the budgets they pass seriously. There is a societal responsibility to take on the issue. The essential point is not to make the mistake of divorcing the issue of employment for people with disabilities from the central Action Plan for Jobs employment strategy. If a housing strategy emerges next Tuesday, it should not divorce housing need for people with disabilities from the central document. I know the document is being made in the middle of an emergency and I understand that on Tuesday people will be lining up to take potshots at it and criticise it even before it is published. Nonetheless, even at this late stage and with the guts of a week to go, if it has not been done, perhaps the strategy could contain many, if not all, of the suggestions in this motion. I have no knowledge of whether they are in the document. I wish the Minister every success and the Labour Party is here to assist in tackling the issues.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State who will have to get used to spending time here as this is what happens on a Friday when one has this level of responsibility. It is great that legislation such as this has come before this House with support from right across the House and that it will be enacted in time to be ready by early September, which is a great achievement by the Minister of State. Given the delay in the formation of the Government, there was a suggestion or fear that it might not be ready in time, but the Minister of State has prioritised it and made it happen, on which he should be congratulated. In respect of public policy, we often talk a lot about children but previous Governments have not necessarily invested and drilled down into what can make family life easier in providing real supports to make parenting better, as said by a previous speaker. If one looks at the European mainstream, certainly the Scandinavian mainstream, one would see that we would certainly be a long way behind it, but that does not mean that we should not start somewhere. This is a positive start. As has been mentioned, it was campaigning groups like Start Strong, ICTU and the National Women's Council that first proposed that two weeks' paid paternity leave would be a good start. The Minister of State and I attended a conference 18 months ago where this case was made quite strongly. I congratulate the Minister of State on the work he has done and offer the full support of my Labour Party colleagues. We should not take this in isolation from other issues in the child care area that need to be addressed. I am sure these issues are outside the Minister of State's remit, but I know that he will be having conversations because this comes as a gender equality measure. Deputy David Stanton is the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, which includes gender equality, and this measure is trying to promote equality in parenting. As we look at those crucial early years, it is remarkable how one can see the power parenting can have. I had a conversation this morning with Preparing for Life in Darndale. It has statistics regarding what intervention can do. The empowerment of parents is key to driving change. I often quote the 1995 report from Betty Hart and Todd Risley. As it is a US report, some of the language is a bit Americanised but the authors say that the average three year old from a welfare dependent family has one third the oral language capacity of a three year old from a professional family. A three year old from a poor family has about 400 words, while a three year old from a rich family has about 1,200. This is before they come anywhere near school. When we talk about early intervention, we often think that this is where school comes in, but the key intervention is family-based - the empowerment of the family and parents to have the skills to employ them in the family setting to ensure dietary, oral language and literacy skills are there from day one. This type of measure gives space and time for the family to concentrate on family matters. Employment matters and bill pressures can be so crushing that having the capacity to spend time with one's family in those early years is key. I know that the Government is pursuing two years' free child care provision, which is a great initiative. In respect of child care, much of the conversation from different parties and interest groups has been about the idea of a tax credit. I would warn against this. I do not believe the tax credit is a solution to the child care issue in Ireland. The international experience shows that tax credits do not do anything for standards and prices. When intervening in the child care area to make it more affordable for families, we should consider other options as laid out by the National Women's Council and Start Strong, which I understand is winding up or has been wound up. I pay tribute to those involved in that organisation, which was very much an evidence-based organisation that tried to provide evidence-based material for policy-makers to consider when driving forward interventions in the early years sphere. Start Strong has come to the end of its existence, which is a shame, but its input can be seen all over this legislation. In congratulating the Minister of State and what he has achieved, I suggest we could have further conversations about the nature of employment as an equality tool. Many of the groups with which the Minister of State is dealing say employment is a key indicator of equality. In fact, discrimination happens most readily in the workplace.Among the groups which the Minister of State will be dealing with are the Traveller organisations which often state the only place a Traveller can get a job is in the Traveller lobby group. He will also be dealing with the disabilities organisations which are determined to ensure the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities is followed through and the LGBT people who want to work in LGBT-friendly environments. There should be no barrier in the workplace to women or mothers playing their full role. We must always be minded of the power of employment as an equality measure. It gives a great sense of self and identity. One of the first questions we ask people when we first meet them is, "Where are you from and what do you do?" If within the identity we have as workers we have legislation that can defend our rights as family people, surely then the productivity of the workers and the workplace will improve. Multinational corporations are often criticised but when one drills down into how they organise their workforce, many of these measures are very generous and not because the multinationals want to be generous but because they have realised that their workers will be more productive if they are adequately catered for in terms of leave and workplace rights. This Bill is a small step in that direction. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing this legislation to this point and assure him he will have the support of the Labour Party in his endeavours. As I said, this legislation will work best in conjunction with the suite of other measures that I know that the Department will be working on, including in the area of child care. We need to understand employment as an equality measure and to be minded that the power of parenting and the ability to enjoy the period of parenting is crucial. The Government's recognition of that through this Bill is welcome.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I enjoyed Senator Billy Lawless's contribution. In the week in which Mr. Donald Trump is to be nominated the Republican candidate for the presidential election in the United States, anybody with a sense of justice should reject Mr. Trump's racism, xenophobia and sexism at every opportunity in the coming months. I raise the issue of disadvantage, particularly in the light of another visit by the Taoiseach to the north inner city of Dublin today. I greatly welcome this visit as it shows the Taoiseach's commitment to the issue that is ongoing in that locality. As we Senators constantly try to remind ourselves, a criminal justice response to murderous feuds will not make a long-term difference. What would make a difference in areas such as the north inner city are investment, empowerment and education. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to the House to discuss the roll-out of the area based childhood, ABC, initiative introduced by the previous Government. We should discuss the investment made under the programme, its success or otherwise and other initiatives that could be fleshed out to empower young people and parents. The House should also discuss literacy issues. It is interesting to note that studies undertaken in the United States show that when the country's prison system, much of which has been outsourced to private interests, is planning its capacity needs for ten or 15 years hence, it examines literacy rates among current ten year old children. The reason is that identifying literacy rates among ten year olds allows the prison system to calculate how many prison spaces it will need in 15 years. We are also aware of studies of the oral language capacity of children of different backgrounds and income thresholds. We often have a knee-jerk reaction to feuds, killings, shootings and murders. If we are serious about long-term investment and change in areas of disadvantage, we must address parental and child empowerment because they will make a difference. I know that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is deeply committed to this change given her background and constituency. A debate on this issue would be highly beneficial. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support the Labour Party motion and endorse the comments made by Senator Gerald Nash. I commend his sterling work and achievements in recent years in seeking to protect workers' rights. I have visited the Dublin Bus drivers' picket line twice in recent months at the Clontarf depot. It is clear from my discussions with them that they want a number of things. Their pay claim has been well aired, but it is clear to everyone that a mechanism must first be found to hold discussions around the table. Thankfully, there have been movements in that regard recently. Second, the future security of the company and the Government's relationship with the company must clarified. In that context, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has been found lacking in using any imagination to help to resolve the dispute. In the motion we are calling for what the Minister should have been working on for the past four months. It took him more than four months just to sit down with Dublin Bus management, despite the fact that the strike was known to be coming down the tracks. The Minister is a fast learner, but, possibly a little like Donald Trump, learning that mouthing off is not an option when one has responsibility. One cannot leak a titbit of information to a former colleague in a national newspaper to garner some positive coverage in future. One cannot talk up a showdown at the O.K. Corral only to pick up one's dignity on the way out. One cannot send a tweet along the lines of, "Shellshock here at the Stepaside bus stop." The Independent Alliance must realise that being in government means one has to do something. Perhaps this is the perfect storm for the Minister, as two of the forces that he hates most in life - trade unions and semi-State bodies - form two sides of his Bermuda Triangle. This is the Minister who previously called trade unions the "arch-insiders of the Celtic Tiger," "big, bearded bosses at SIPTU" and the "ayatollahs of social partnership." He has described pay claims as "Liberty Hall's latest smash-and-grab raid on the Exchequer" and, colourfully, the "social partners had their snouts buried firmly in the national trough." This is what he has said of CIE: "CIE has in recent years been exposed as a swamp of waste and skulduggery;" "Quangos like CIE and its three subsidiaries - Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and larnród Éireann - are in dire need of efficiencies. There is plenty of fat hidden in the darker corners of these bloated bodies;" and "There is 'something of the dark' about CIE. Or at least a very thick fog embracing the murky company." The Labour Party believes it is time for Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance to come clean. What is their vision for public transport? As a Deputy and Minister of State in the previous Government, I know that if the Labour Party had not stood up and entered into government, Dublin Bus would have been privatised and the Minister would probably have been one of the loudest cheerleaders. The current Government should set out its vision. As Senator Gerald Nash outlined, we can adopt an industrial relations model from other northern European countries. We want the Government to set out its vision for the reinstatement in the coming years of the pre-crash subvention to Dublin Bus. I commend the motion to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Taoiseach. In fairness to the Leader, Senator Jerry Buttimer, it is incumbent on us in this House to work together to try to solve problems, a few of which I want to raise with the Taoiseach in my short contribution.  Senator Lynn Ruane and I work in the drugs area and want to have good engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne. Senators Colette Kelleher and Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and I who work on the Traveller ethnicity issue hope to receive good co-operation from the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton. However, I must ask the Taoiseach about the issue of direct provision and my contribution will be solely on that issue. In this House, when I was Minister of State, there was uniformity of opinion on the issue of direct provision. I see Senator Martin Conway who is one of the most vocal on it in front of me. We came to speak with one voice and the need for action on it. A report was commissioned. At the time the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I worked very hard to commission that report and worked to implement it. It was said on national radio last week that of the 2,000 people in direct provision accommodation over five years, as a direct result of that report, 1,500 are no longer in it, which is a good day's work. However, the draft programme for Government that was released contained a commitment to implement the McMahon report, which took nine months to put together. It was compiled by NGOs and departmental officials and when it was signed off on, the assumption was that it would be implemented. To my horror and that of others, that sentence regarding the implementation of the McMahon report was dropped from the actual programme for Government. I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach, because of the nature of the vulnerability of the families and children living in direct provision accommodation, that we implement the report. We are not asking for a new report. We are not asking for action to be taken which has not been already cited. We are asking that the Taoiseach give a commitment to implement the report which was commissioned by the Department with officials from many Departments and NGOs in good faith and which has been published and was being implemented. The Minister of State was here and was not in a position to give at commitment that it would be implemented. The Minister for Justice and Equality is not in a position to say she will implement it. I would love if the Taoiseach could stand in this House and make such a commitment to the Members who collectively, in a cross-party manner - this is not a divisive issue in this House - are all committed to implementation of the report. The Taoiseach stood as a proud Irishman in the Dáil and spoke in a tearful way on the issue of the Magdalen women and was commended for doing so. I commended him - we all did - because it was an emotional day for everybody in the Oireachtas. However, I am fully convinced there will be a Taoiseach in 20 or 30 years' time who will have to make a similar apology on the issue of direct provision. It is within the Taoiseach's gift today to stand in front of us as a collective and say: "I, as Taoiseach, will oversee or ensure that the McMahon report will be implemented."
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome Mr. Cooney and join other Senators in expressing sympathy following his bereavement in the summer. The Cathaoirleach asked us not to stray into discussing the presidential election in the United States. While that is fair enough, at every opportunity before election day we must call out the racist buffoonery that appears to be becoming popular across the United States. The problem is not confined to America. As previous speakers noted, there are very unwelcome, xenophobic and racist comments being made by people from across the political spectrum in Europe. In the United Kingdom such commentary is becoming mainstream. Immigration is extremely important and Mr. Cooney's wise words on the issue were very welcome.  The most rank hypocrisy in Irish public life can be observed when Irish politicians ask US Administrations and politicians to change their views on the status of Irish immigrants in America. How on earth can we, with a straight face, present ourselves in the White House with a bowl of shamrock every March while refusing point blank to do at home what we ask the United States to do? Between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented individuals, including many children, live in Ireland. Last March the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child asked the Government to take steps to regularise these undocumented workers. Nothing has been done since. While we will have nodding heads around the Chamber and gushing declarations of love for our brothers, sisters and children in America, as is entirely appropriate, how on earth can we tell the US political system it must get its immigration system in order to benefit our children when we refuse to do the same here? I ask representatives of all parties to leave hypocrisy at the door. They should ask the leadership of their respective parties what they are doing to regularise the position of undocumented workers in this republic. The language used in that regard is interesting. When speaking about the American political system, we always use the term the "undocumented Irish" but the terminology somehow changes to "illegal immigrants" when we are describing undocumented workers in Ireland. The best symbol of goodwill we could possibly show in terms of what we want the US system to do is to do what we ask the United States to do right here at home. Any US Senator, Congressman or President could easily ask, in response to all the lobbying being done in the United States, what we are doing at home and whether we are regularising undocumented workers or doing what the UN Committee for the Rights of the Child asked Ireland to do, because the answer is "No". I suggest, therefore, that after this debate is done, we all ensure our respective political parties get the finger out and do what the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child asked us to do before we engage again in rank hypocrisy in March 2017 when a bowl of shamrock will be handed over to the US President. This grates on my sense of social justice, Ireland's place in the world and its responsibility to mankind.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister. While many of us in the House may be very critical of Government policy in many areas, it should be commended for how proactive it has been in dealing with this issue prior to and since the referendum. The Minister's presentation is very welcome. I find the entire issue profoundly depressing because of what it says about modern politics, not only in Europe but also throughout the world. It is depressing how a minority view in one party can become the mainstream to drive the political agenda and split a country. The emotions and xenophobia generated since and because of the referendum are startling. I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister on the future of the European Union because it has been a force for good. I am stunned to hear voices in the House, of members of parties which have resisted every referendum for decades on integrating more with the wider family of the European Union, now criticise the Government for what it is or is not doing on Brexit. Since it was founded in post-Second World War Europe, the European Union has allowed peaceful diplomacy to be the order of the day on the Continent. We can only deal with the great international issues of climate justice and the refugee crisis as a collective in the European Union. When one major member state decides to leave, what does it mean for the greater project? We must have a conversation in Ireland about the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom. The critical issue is the border with Northern Ireland. Communities in the Border region recently made a presentation to the Oireachtas committee on regional affairs. They are, rightly, very concerned about the impact Brexit will have in the coming years. What does Brexit mean for the future of the European Union, diplomacy and discussions and the state of international politics? We know what is happening in France, Austria, Hungary and Germany. The political mindset which led to great men and women of the 1940s and 1950s deciding that they had to put the disasters of the past behind them and build a new future seems to be under threat more than ever. It is particularly worrying considering what is happening in the United States. I commend the work done by the Government prior to and after the referendum. I found it astonishing at the time of the referendum that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had particularly taken a position in favour of exiting the European Union. I was astonished that somebody in her role, which is so critical to peace and prosperity on the island, representing the British Government in the Six Counties, would take such a position. I believe strongly that Ms Villiers was absolutely wrong to take a position on the issue. She was definitely wrong to advocate for what was clearly not in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours. As a pro-European party, the Labour Party will assist him in any way it can. I worry about the future of the European project and other member states and political parties looking at what has happened and seeing Brexit as a political opportunity. I worry about our ability as a collective to deal with the great issues of the day which can only be dealt with by the wider international community.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is where the goodwill ends.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister. It is incredibly apt that students from a primary school have just arrived into the Visitors Gallery. As I presume they are from a primary school, I wish them a very happy trip to the Houses of the Oireachtas and hope they learn loads. If they have questions for the Minister, they should be sure to pass them to me and I will ask them before the end. The Minister is here to make sure students get their homework done properly every night. I appreciate the Minister's presence and want to be as constructive as possible. He has published an action plan for education which is to be commended. We need to have a roadmap for where we want to be and what we want to achieve. Education is something about which many people in Ireland feel very strongly. When one travels around the world and visits other jurisdictions to see what they are doing in education, sometimes the statements they make or their ambitions can strike a chord because perhaps such ambitions are missing in Ireland. I spent some time in West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow visiting a very disadvantaged community. They speak about wanting to see the absolute eradication of illiteracy. The total eradication of illiteracy is their motivation and ambition. Would it not be wonderful if in Ireland the national obsession in the education system was with the total eradication of illiteracy? One in three children leaving disadvantaged schools has basic reading problems and about 17.9% of the adult population is functionally illiterate. We have an issue with literacy which the previous Government did a huge amount to try to address.  The people of Finland will state the aspect which underpins their education philosophy is equality. It is not a principle of one party or another or of the left or the right but what they have collectively agreed. They have decided and all accept that equality in the education system is what is best for all children. The problem in Ireland is that we do not really have a word or phrase that underpins our education philosophy. I do not believe we do. In Ireland we have a publicly funded education system that is not a State education system because we outsource it to schools, boards of management and patron bodies. What inevitably happens is that competition gets into the mix and the system perpetuates inequality.We separate children on the basis of religion and gender. Where else in society do we believe it is acceptable to separate children on the basis of gender at the age of four years? Is it any surprise that gender stereotypes evolve in society when children in so many schools are separated on the basis of gender? It is probably more of an urban than a rural phenomenon. The construct of the education system allows it to happen. Only last week the Ombudsman for Children asked for the relationship between the State and the education system to be re-evaluated. It is time for us to set out a roadmap, in conjunction with the Minister's action plan for education, to lance the boil of the constitutional impediment to a genuine State education system. When we try to engage on issues related to school books or transport or try to bring about an education system like that in Northern Ireland, representatives of the Department of Education and Skills almost faint at the suggestion we have actual day-to-day engagement and a role in managing the day-to-day affairs of schools. They are horrified by the idea. The action plan for education is unlike any other action plan for education in Europe because we have a constitutional impediment to day-to-day involvement in the running of schools. This goes back to religious and baptism issues and all the rest of it. In the full light of day in a modern republic, this set-up appears to be absolutely crazy. I tried successfully to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. What was it about? It was about trying to ensure LGBT, divorced or unmarried and cohabiting teachers would not be discriminated against by their schools. I could only amend the legislation. I could not have it repealed completely because of the constitutional reality in terms of where we stood in the education system. The 1995 Hart and Risley study proved how a three-year-old from a welfare-dependent family had one third of the oral language capacity of a three-year-old from a professional family. The Minister was in the north inner city recently. He quite rightly said the relationship between the school and wider community was paramount. We cannot achieve everything in the school system. Children do not live in schools. However, the reality is that we need far more certainty on the ABC programme which the Minister was in Darndale recently celebrating and it was great to see him there. We have rolled out 13 such programmes throughout the State. They work with schools and the wider community to tackle acute disadvantage. We need more certainty from the Minister in that regard. Obviously, he has a role in working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in that regard. The issue of special needs assistants, SNAs, in the education system is central. A report was compiled last year by Senator Mary Moran on the role of SNAs. It highlighted the uncertainty they faced, the nature of their career path and the fact they should be an essential part of the education system, rather than their role being chopped and changed from year to year as budgetary priorities went up and down. The issue of teacher diversity must be addressed. A teacher is capable of being a powerful role model. How are we addressing the issue of getting more working class and Traveller children, as well as more children from ethnically diverse backgrounds, into teaching roles? How powerful would it be for the average Irish primary school to have a teacher from the Traveller community, a disadvantaged background or an eastern European background? That does not happen often and there are many and varied reasons for it, but can we engage with the teacher training colleges to determine how we can improve the position, given that it is such a powerful role? It is a question of the ambition we have for the society we are trying to construct. It is not simply about producing economic units. I realise the Minister has come from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I appreciate that his mindset has had to be recast over the summer months. The purpose is not simply to become an economic unit. That is not the point of education but to believe and understand the beauty of poetry, language, music, dance, sport and the basis for why we are alive. That is what education is all about. These are more profound than simply becoming an economic unit. I wish that ambition was written throughout the action plan for education with a view to moving towards the goal of empowering young people to be the best they can possibly be. We need to focus more on equality as being fundamental to our educational vision and try harder to lance the boil within the Constitution. That is something we have to grasp. Why not say we want to eradicate illiteracy in society? If the Minister does that, the Labour Party will support him.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I suppose in the aftermath of a budget, perhaps it is easy to don the political jersey and find everything that is negative in it, but I do not think that it is necessarily fair or adds anything to the political debate in this country. There are good things in the budget and anybody with a fair mind would acknowledge that. However, I would like the Leader to address two issues which concern children. These are two issues in which we expected the advancements of the past few years would have been built on. One is the issue of class sizes and the second is the issue of free GP care for those under 12 years. When an improvement is made over a number of years, it is a reasonable expectation that this improvement would be continued.  In the past few years class sizes in primary schools have not been made worse. They have not been increased. In budget 2016 the pupil-teacher ratio was decreased at primary and secondary level. It was reduced by one point at primary level where the issue is acute. The expectation was that over a number of years, it would gradually be brought down. That did not happen in yesterday's budget. I am a little disturbed by that because surely when we now have resources to invest in areas that are clearly crying out for investment, class size is one of those issues that affects every school-going child in primary school and their parents. Many children in large classes will do fine because they can achieve in any circumstances but children with special educational needs or behavioural difficulties are the ones who will benefit from smaller class sizes. The vision of going from having the largest class sizes in Europe to progressively bringing down that pupil-teacher ratio is something I thought would continue from last year but it has not happened. I think we should have a discussion on that in this Chamber.  Again, we made a huge advance on the issue of free GP care for children under the age of six years. I felt at the time it was a major advance that also would be continued. Again, for some reason, free GP care for those under 12 years has slipped below the radar. The children of Ireland who had a reasonable expectation that their class sizes would have come down and that free GP care for those under 12 years would also have been introduced will be a bit surprised. Where is the Government's vision for those two areas?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«When it comes to the issue of Seanad reform, there have been a number of reports, commissions and referenda. Much is said about the eighth amendment to the Constitution and the damage it has done to Irish women over the years, but the seventh amendment to the Constitution is another interesting one that rarely raises any comment. The interesting thing about the seventh amendment to the Constitution is that it was never legislated for. It was an attempt to widen the franchise for voters in Seanad elections. In the almost 40 years since there have been quite a number of commissions and reports. There was a referendum a number of years ago to abolish this Chamber, which I supported at that point. I remember debating with Senator Michael McDowell at the time at an event where we took opposing views on it. Both our positions have changed over the years. It was my interaction with this Chamber as Minister of State that changed my view on its validity and what it has to offer. There comes a stage where we have to put an end to the endless round of commissions and reports and actually do something. The issue with this Chamber is the perceived or otherwise disconnect between it and the electorate. This Bill tries to address that in many ways. There is potential in the Chamber to give a voice to people in society who do not often get a chance to have their voices heard. Much has been said about the diaspora and Irish citizens in the North of Ireland, but I am thinking also of groups such as Travellers and others who would benefit greatly from having representation in this Chamber on matters that concern them. One issue that concerns me in the Bill is the ability of an Oireachtas Member to be also a member of a local authority. Often in this Chamber Members speak about their constituency. Technically we do not have a constituency because we come into the Chamber as national politicians. We do not have a geographical constituency. If we were to go back to the situation where local authority members could run for the Seanad and have a dual mandate, we would dilute the national focus of the Chamber. Inevitably county council and city council issues would be brought to the floor of the Seanad. That happens anyway but it would be compounded by a situation where there is not that separation. One of the positive moves of the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, was to propose the abolition of the dual mandate, which eventually became law in 2003. It provided that one could not be a Member of the national Parliament and a local authority member. It was very controversial at the time for people who were in that position and did not like it. It separated various areas of local administration and public representation. Council work was taken up by councillors and national work and national legislation were taken on by Oireachtas Members. I would have to be convinced that to go back to a situation where Senators could be local authority members is a positive move. In terms of what we are trying to achieve in the House, we work quite well together when we speak with one voice. I am keenly aware that politics is under more international pressure now. There is more pressure now on the validity of public life, the ability to make a case, and the ability to believe in something and stand for something than there has been ever before. Looking at what is happening in the United States, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe, it appears to me that politics is in a complete mess. The fault for that lies with politicians and the political system. If we lose faith in the institutions of our political system, we are in a very dangerous position. We can see what is happening in the United Kingdom, where a very nasty scenario has arisen. I mentioned the United States and Europe also. When we change the way we do business in the Oireachtas, we have to proceed with caution, although there has been so much caution around this Chamber that it has led to nothing happening. I suggest the Minister of State, the Acting Chairman and Senators take this Bill in good faith. We can work on its various elements as we proceed. If the Chamber is to have any validity in the future, its connectivity with the public has to be reinforced. I question the ability of a Senator in this House to have a dual function in a local authority because, if we are to be serious about national politics and talk about national issues, having a focus on the local authority area would not be a good move.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for being here to discuss this matter. I am quite sure he is aware of the ongoing issues in the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital. In the past few years, as an active representative and a Member of the Oireachtas, I have visited the emergency department on a number of occasions and met staff there and senior management. What senior management has told me in stark terms is that the emergency department is physically not fit for purpose. There are also other issues. There are staffing issues, with the fact that the demographics indicate that patients are particularly elderly. These are eminent staff who are experts in the field. They know their hospital well and care for their patients extremely well. Anybody who has visited it will attest to the fact that the physical environment of the emergency department is not up to standard and if the senior management team in the hospital is stating it is not safe and that they cannot stand over it, clearly something has to happen. We are obviously in a period where the Exchequer is in a healthier place. Hospital management has put together a plan. It has a vision of investment in the emergency department to bring it up to standard and provide a much better service for the local community in Dublin and the wider region. It has estimated the cost at €45 million. The previous Government, in the guise of the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and me, met senior management. We were in a position to commit to working with senior management to deliver the plan, that the investment would happen and that the emergency department would be reconfigured and reconstructed in order to be a much better physical fit for the hospital. I have been running a local campaign in which constituents who want to see the investment happen have been engaging. Have the Minister for Health and the Department committed to implementation of this €45 million plan? Has the Minister met senior management? Is it part of the Estimates process? Is it something that will be delivered in the short to medium term because anybody who has visited the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital will realise what is happening there cannot continue? While I did not see anything in the Estimates process and the budget announcements about Beaumont Hospital, I was eager to have this discussion today because, before we head into the winter months, it is important for the staff in Beaumont Hospital and the wider community to know that the Government takes this issue seriously and wants to deliver a better service in the hospital.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I sometimes get a little worried when people use the phrase "it is my understanding" and I had hoped for something a little stronger. The Minister of State indicated that Beaumont Hospital was in the process of finalising business cases for these new developments, but it is my understanding the hospital had completed its business case for the emergency department because it was handed to me almost a year ago. It details the €45 million it believes would be required for it. He stated the business cases would be reviewed by the HSE capital and property steering group which approves projects for inclusion in the multi-annual capital plan in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines. The business case has been finalised, but the Minister of State's reply indicates that it will be reviewed by the capital and property steering group and that, as part of the process, funding provision will be made available for the planning and design phases of the proposed new developments in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017. I was hoping there would be a commitment that the capital plan, as outlined by senior management in Beaumont Hospital, of which I have a copy, was being taken seriously and would be delivered. The reply seems to suggest the business plan has not been finalised, but it has been. It also implies that it will be reviewed. The community in the Minister of State's constituency was hoping for something a little stronger. I totally understand there are other issues, including staffing and demographics that are particular to Beaumont Hospital and the wider area. The business case has been produced and I am worried about timelines and the commitment that can be given about the delivery of the physical infrastructure the hospital states it needs. It cannot stand over the service it provides, which I am sure the Minister of State will agree is extremely worrying.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister for the latest of several discussions on Brexit in this House. I commend the Government's action before the referendum in doing as much as it possibly could to speak to the Irish community in Britain and all British voters about the importance of this issue for Irish people. However, no message should go out from this or any chamber which does not state clearly that Brexit is an absolute, complete and unmitigated disaster. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, came to the House, I talked about the importance of European connectivity, noted that the European Union had in general been a force for good, born out of the ashes of the Second World War and that we had to re-evaluate the European project. The United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, at the behest of the people of England and Wales, is a disaster for Ireland and the Union. As Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn rightly noted, it was narrow-minded nationalism and the whims of a small group which took over the mindset and mainstream of British politics and led to this disaster. That mindset is being replicated, unfortunately, across the world. The regional development committee, of which I am a member, recently received a delegation from Blacklion, County Cavan. I was interested to hear about Senator Frances Black's connections with that area, particularly as mother is from Blacklion and my grandfather was an IRA volunteer in the Civil War. He was imprisoned, went on hunger strike and escaped before spending the rest of his life as a customs officer on the Border, which was an ironic change of career. My mother recalls there being a time zone difference between the North and the South during the Second World War. The delegates from Blacklion told us that Brexit had already had a devastating impact on their community. People who were envisaging buying homes in Cavan and working in Enniskillen are pulling out left right and centre, with their plans for their future and raising their families in disarray. In recent years, because we have come to a collective complacency around peace in Europe and peace on this island, we never envisaged that this would happen. A case before the High Court in Belfast, which Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile has mentioned in the House, involves a challenge by all but one of the major political parties in the North to the constitutional validity of what the British Government has done. Their argument is that it requires a vote of Parliament in order for Brexit to proceed and that no such vote has taken place. I am interested in hearing the Minister's view on that case. I welcome the Government's announcement that an all-party forum will take place at the beginning of next month. We in this House are national politicians and must think of the country as a whole. The Border region will be particularly affected by this issue. In our negotiations and discussions about what happens next, we must be mindful of that impact. The message needs to go out from the Government to all of our European partners that this no small deal. If any other EU member state has sympathy with what Britain has done or feels there might be some political advantage in going down that road, we must say to it that this has been an unmitigated disaster. We cannot say there are advantages in it for Ireland. The message from this country must be that this was a right-wing conspiracy which has gone belly-up and will cause untold misery economically and socially across the Continent. Any dilution of that message would be a major mistake for the Government to make. Senator Frances Black has brought a section of the Minister's speech to my attention. A motion was passed in this House last week, drafted by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, concerning the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA. The Minister stated:Ireland will also continue to make the most effective use of the framework of trade agreements the European Union already has in place, as well as supporting the opening of new markets through the Union. These agreements such as the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA, which will be signed by EU Ministers in Luxembourg next week ...Is the Minister mindful that this House rejected that particular agreement, by way of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's motion, and will she respond to this? Is it something she will take into consideration? I am not sure whether there has been a vote on the matter in the Lower House, but this House had a robust debate on it and most Members rejected the idea of this deal. I ask the Minister to ensure the Government will place a particular focus on Border regions in considering the impact of Brexit, is mindful of not being complacent about the peace process, North and South, and is an absolutely unwavering advocate for the European project. Minsters must speak in stark and forthright terms about how damaging this whole event has been in order to ward off other member states from going down the same road. I ask the Minister to respond to the expressed will of this House on the particular trade agreement to which she referred. I wish her well in her endeavours, but I reiterate that there should be no message from this House or Ministers which dilutes the reality that Brexit is an unmitigated political, economic and social disaster.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In recent years Ireland has enjoyed some level of relative industrial peace. At this stage, however, we have reached a grave situation. We are facing strike action by second-level teachers and by An Garda Síochána. Today's advertisement in the national newspapers seeking members of the public to go in to schools to perform supervision and substitution work is, at best, misguided and, at worst, completely misunderstands the nature of schools and how they operate. Yesterday the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, thought it was a good idea to say that the public would never view members of An Garda Síochána the same way again if they were to go on strike. That is an outrageous statement. It is clear that the Government, in particular Fine Gael, has no comprehension of how industrial relations work or how best to deal with trade unions or the public sector in general. I suggest to the Leader that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, should be invited to the House to discuss his announcements in the budget of a public pay commission to report by next summer. Surely we must realise that the situation in which we find ourselves is grave, that schools will close and that gardaí will not be on the streets. The response from Government seems to be a complete misunderstanding of the sensitivities involved, of the public sector and of how to deal with industrial relations. The response has been a "face them down" attitude which is not going to work. What the House does not need is any more hyperbole; therefore, I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to respectfully request the Minister to attend to the matter to overcome the situation where our schools are going to close down and where gardaí are not on the street. If that was to happen in any other European member state, the assumption would be that its government had completely lost control of the situation. I ask that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform come to the House to expand on his one line statement in the Budget Statement as to what is his vision for the public sector. It might contribute to a conversation on how we might avoid the situation of our schools closing, of gardaí not being on the street and of bitterness and rancour being in our schools and in our police force for years to come. If the Government's tone is to continue along the line of what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said yesterday, I worry that the situation will completely unravel
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will she come to talk to us?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will she come to talk to us specifically about pay restoration?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No, with respect, I asked the Leader a direct question.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Shock.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State and the work done by Senator Mark Daly and others. I also welcome those from the deaf community who join us; the young people and the signers who are interpreting for those in the Visitors Gallery. Sometimes in this Chamber one knows something special is about to happen because of the attendance of Senators, the Visitors Gallery is full and because there is something in the air. In view of the campaign which was undertaken by those who feel passionately about this, there is something in the air. This issue is about silence, empowerment and citizenship. If the Leas-Cathaoirleach will allow, I shall speak directly to the young people here who have been mentioned by other Senators. Often it is very difficult to stand up for oneself, but it can be even more difficult to stand up for others. If you were here earlier, you would have heard a conversation in the Chamber about the Traveller community. Speakers across the House spoke about the necessity to stand up and recognise the Traveller community and do better by them. If you had been in the Chamber this morning you would have heard Senators across the House speak about the issues in Aleppo and Ireland's responsibility to do something about what is happening in Syria and to open our arms and the State to those who need us most. It has been said that when it comes to issues that you feel strongly about as young people, you should ask yourself, "If not me then who, and if not now then when?" As young people, you have taken on this issue; you have brought it to the heart of the Oireachtas and you have made all of us who walked into this Chamber this afternoon know that something special is happening. You should be absolutely commended for this and you should realise the power you have. Martin Luther King said, "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter". Much has been said about the 1916 Rising and the commemorations. Perhaps only now are we beginning to realise the depth of the wound caused by the recession in the State, which is about eight or nine years old, and the depth of the wounds it has caused to a generation of Irish people who may know nothing else but this financial crisis. We can now reimagine the type of country in which we want to live. It is about citizenship, but how can you be a citizen if you are forced to live in silence? This is not a case of Government or politicians granting something to a section of our society, because the empowerment in these situations is very important. It is about all of us, collectively, recognising the importance of citizenship. Let us realise what is happening across the world, in the United States of America and across Europe, including the United Kingdom. Politics is turning into a section of Irish society pointing fingers and blame at others and saying the reason they are unhappy is because of that group or those people. What you are doing today is allowing people to come in and be part of the common citizenship. Often, this House and politics struggles to connect outside of these walls. What you have done and what the deaf community is asking for is to become part of that common citizenship. I contend that the system should be bending over backwards to recognise a mechanism to break the silence. The Labour Party supports the Bill absolutely. I am glad that everyone in the House, across party lines, agrees - as happened this morning with the Syrian issue and as happened this afternoon with the Travellers' rights, and is happening now with regard to Irish Sign Language recognition. It brings a level of political legitimacy to the House and also gives a message to young people, old people, citizens who are in the Chamber, on the power they have. If you really want to make a change and believe in it enough, there is nothing you cannot achieve.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I formally second the Senator Grace O'Sullivan's proposed amendment. Once again, the Labour Party is calling on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come before this House. Many secondary schools across the State are closed today. I am surprised it has taken until I have risen to my feet for this matter to be raised in the Chamber. We are facing unprecedented industrial relations chaos. It is affecting students, teachers, parents and families, and I have not yet spoken about gardaí. This dispute is being mishandled and now we have the suggestion that teachers engaged in this industrial dispute will be taken off the payroll. The Minister for Education and Skills and the Government have managed to make a bad situation worse. Over the past few days Senator Nash, Senator Humphreys and I have called for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come into the House to lay out his plans for the public sector pay commission he proposes will meet between now and next summer, and to detail his vision in that regard. Our vision is that the negotiations on a second Lansdowne Road agreement should begin immediately. That would take the tension out of these disputes, allow people to understand there is a process in place, and assure public servants that this Government has some level of respect for them. It appears to me that the Government is showing zero level of respect for public sector unions and a lack of understanding of the way public sector unions or the public sector works. In the short period of time it has been in government, it has managed to allow two industrial disputes spiral almost out of control whereas in the past five years we had relative industrial peace. Once again, for the third day in a row, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the House to discuss with us how best to proceed because my fear, and that of my party, is that this Government does not have a cat's clue how to deal with industrial relations, does not understand the public service or public service unions and will continue to make a bad situation worse.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. As part of my responsibilities when I was Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I took the opportunity to visit as many clinics and speak to as many service operators and service users as I could. Last year, I visited a clinic on Granby Row off Dorset Street where I met a wonderful woman who was travelling from the midlands to Dublin every day to access her methadone. She was a young mother getting her life back together. She took a bus from Portlaoise to the national drug treatment centre in Trinity Court and back every day because she was told she would have had to wait six months for treatment where she lived. Three weeks ago, she died of an overdose. I am told that those who have come to a stage in their lives with their addictions when they realise they cannot go on and ask for help are told they have to wait between six months and two years to get on a methadone maintenance programme. There is a cap on the number of clients certain clinics can help. I appreciate the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne in this regard. I have observed her work at first hand and listened to a number of her speeches.I was at an event a few mornings ago at which she gave an incredibly impassioned speech about our responsibility to treat those who are vulnerable due to their addictions with the most compassion possible. I believe she is doing a sound job and I support her in everything she is doing. However, what is the Department's and the Government's response on how to shorten the waiting time to access this essential treatment programme? Also, what can we do to ensure that clinics such as the one on Granby Row have the capacity to deal with all those who require their services? Obviously, we must address the long waiting times, but having caps on the numbers of patients clinics can deal with does not stand up to scrutiny. This is a life or death issue. I am advocating for people who are often not well thought of or well regarded in our society. I was incredibly struck when I heard the news last week that the beautiful person I had met, who was getting her life together and doing her best to overcome her addiction by travelling from Portlaoise to Dublin every day to make her and her child's life better, had succumbed to her addiction three weeks ago and died on the street of an overdose. We could save lives by changing or re-evaluating how we are doing things. The people on the front line simply wish to be given the tools to do their work better.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is obliged to attend a meeting of the health committee. Perhaps the Minister of State would convey to her the seriousness of the situation. I accept that she is aware of it, but perhaps a meeting with the senior team in Granby Row would be of benefit simply to have a first-hand conversation on the pressures the team is under and the solutions it is offering. I met with the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, after she was appointed and I suggested a number of places that she should visit. She has done that. I am particularly impressed by the compassion she has brought to this brief. Statistics on a page are one thing but the problem with this issue is that those who are afflicted with addiction, particularly heroin addiction, are constantly undermined in the public perception because of their portrayal in the media. When one meets somebody who is getting her life together and who symbolises in one's mind how the system can work and then one hears less than a year later that the person has succumbed to her addiction and one tries to square that with the reality of her life travelling from Portlaoise to Dublin every day, one must only come to the conclusion that the reason this continues is that, at some level, public policy demands that this person be ashamed of the reasons they are ill. There is an element of victim blaming in that regard. I realise the Minister is trying to change this and that she feels passionately about it, but perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, would convey to her an invitation to meet with the senior team in Granby Row. It would be an attempt to understand better the realities that people are dealing with on the front line. The issue of the cap was not mentioned in the Minister's response. The statistics that were outlined would suggest that things are getting better. Regardless of whether that is true, people are being told it could take two years to get onto a methadone maintenance programme. I believe that is being said to give people the impression that this will not happen overnight, but two years is an awfully long time. Six months is also a long time. For some people the prospect of waiting six months is too long. We are losing people in that gap. I ask the Minister to convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, the invitation to meet the senior management team in the clinic. Perhaps we can then move to a situation where fewer lives are being lost unnecessarily.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Edmund Burke once said that the only way evil can prosper is for good men to do nothing. America has just elected a fascist and the best thing that good people in Ireland can do is to ring him up and ask him if it is okay to still bring the shamrock on St. Patrick's Day. I am embarrassed by the reaction of the Government to what has happened in America. I cannot believe the reaction from An Taoiseach and the Government. I do not use the word "fascist" lightly. What else would one call somebody who threatens to imprison his political opponents? What else would one call somebody who threatens not to allow people of a certain religious faith into his country? How would one describe somebody who was threatening to deport 10 million people? What would one say about somebody who says that the media, the judiciary, and the political system is rigged? He then wins an election and the best we can come up with is a phone call asking if it still okay to bring the shamrock. I am appalled that a female Member of this House went on social media to congratulate this man. I refer the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to the statement from Angela Merkel:Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom, and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or political views. I offer the next President of the United States close co-operation on the basis of these values.Can the Government not understand what is happening? We are at an ugly international crossroads. What is happening in Britain and across Europe is appalling. It has echoes of the 1930s. America, the most powerful country in the world, has just elected a fascist and the best a Government spokesperson can come out with is, "We have to talk about foreign direct investment and we have to be conscious of American investments in Ireland". There are 50,000 undocumented Irish in America who I am sure are fearful for their futures. When will we have the moral courage to speak in terms other than economic all the time and to realise what is happening? If the Taoiseach of this country cannot stand as an Irishman at the crossroads of the ugly venture that the international political system is facing into and call it for what it is, then we are doing nothing. I am absolutely frightened by what is happening to our world and what is happening in respect of our inability to stand up against it. I congratulate Colm Eastwood of the SDLP who said he will not participate in the charade on St. Patrick's Day. It is a clear challenge to other political leaders in the country who may be more interested in their fund-raising capacity in America so as not to insult potential American donors and the dollars that could come into their political coffers here in Ireland. Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House to ask him how we are supposed to deal with this monster who has just been elected President of America because none of us in years to come should look back on this period and say we did not do everything in our power to call this out for what it is?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be wonderful if the Taoiseach had said that. Will it happen?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will allow Senator James Reilly to go before me.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is reasonable for Senators to request a debate with the Minister of the day. I was a bit taken aback that a request was made several weeks ago but it was not adhered to.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We do not want to be having votes on the Order of Business to facilitate a debate on an issue and no Minister turns up. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the interview on "Morning Ireland" with Dr. Hickey and what he is projecting for the winter months for Sligo hospital. I found it quite frightening. Regardless of political persuasion, and before we get into arguments about how things should be paid for and using phrases such as "leprechaun economics", we should have a reasoned debate on where the health system is going, particularly over the coming months. In my area, there is a constant strain on the facilities at Beaumont Hospital. There has been a request from the hospital's senior management for a major investment of €45 million for a better accident and emergency department. That is the suggestion from people at the coalface. It is only reasonable that when individual Senators, in good faith, make a request for the Minister of the day, be it for mental health or the overall health system, to come to the House for a debate in a non-partisan fashion, it should be adhered to and facilitated. In fairness, the House, across the board, has worked quite well on the many issues affecting people.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is not true.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That simply is not true.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can outline-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He never worked with the Labour Party.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to share my time with Senator Kevin Humphreys.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Maybe five and three, depending on how I go. This is the new politics. I find the spectacle before us this evening depressing. I commend my colleague Senator Grace O'Sullivan, and her colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group, for bringing the Bill forward and for persisting with it. For Government and Fianna Fáil representatives to stand up and give some kind of an excuse as to what has happened is quite embarrassing. It is an embarrassment to this House also. Clearly what has happened is that a last minute phone call from Fianna Fáil to Fine Gael, their buddies, asked them to scrap or to oppose-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----to oppose this Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The hard work put into the Bill by the Senator is being opposed. The Labour Party and my colleague Deputy Sean Sherlock also have a Bill on this very issue to be tabled next week. That, however, is not preventing us from supporting Senator Grace O'Sullivan's worthy Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Apparently, the reason for opposing the Bill is that there is some hastily found EU law that will spare Fine Gael's blushes. I would like to lance that one if I might. The Labour Party has carefully considered the position of whether EU law would prevent member states from taking action on the issue. Articles 34 and 35 of the treaty set out the principle that as a single market is an area without internal borders, restriction on the movement of goods are not allowed and the free movement of goods should be guaranteed. Undoubtedly an Irish ban on the sale of products containing microbeads would have the effect of restricting certain imports. However, Article 36 of the treaty goes on to say that "The provisions of Articles 34 and 35 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports ... [that are] justified on grounds of ... the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants". The EU treaty directly acknowledges that national measures can be taken to protect the environment and this undoubtedly is one of those measures, as has been very well put by my colleague Senator Grace O'Sullivan. In December 2014, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden issued a joint statement to EU environment Ministers calling for an EU ban on microplastics in cosmetics and detergents. A January 2016 research report, commissioned by the European Union Commission, looked at what EU mechanisms were available to reduce microbead pollution from cosmetics. That report concluded that introducing a ban on microbeads at EU level would be more complicated than the law used in the US and Canada. The report said that it was unclear as to whether any of the existing directives and regulations that had been identified would be suitable. In light of this hesitancy at EU level we believe that domestic action is necessary and appropriate. The Government cannot hide behind EU law in this instance. It is true that our proposed legislation amounts - on the face of it - to a trade barrier but there is a well-established procedure for dealing with this if the mindset was there within Government and within its coalition partners in Fianna Fáil. The EU Transparency Directive sets up a procedure obliging the member states to notify the Commission of all draft regulations and products before they are adapted in national law. The notification triggers a standstill period of three months. The Commission and the other member states can use this time to examine the notified draft regulations to determine whether or not it complies with the EU treaty and the principles of the free movement of goods and services. If there is no reaction the draft can be adopted after the three month standstill period has expired. This is exactly the procedure that the de facto Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin had to follow when he introduced the ban on smoking in the workplace. There was a standstill period for the new rules and then they came in to full force and effect. The EU Commission can block the proposal if the draft legislation concerns a matter where the EU itself proposes to act. This is clearly not the case on micro-plastics. Fine Gael should stop pretending, or hiding behind EU law. The fact is that a last minute phone call took place as a result of Deputy Timmy Dooley throwing the dodie out of the pram. He wanted the credit for himself, and an extremely good piece of legislation from the Green Party, supported by the Labour Party - even though we had our own Bill in the mix - is now being shot down. The pair of you should be ashamed of yourselves.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Senator.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is Fianna Fáil's system. It set it up.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am pointing at Fianna Fáil. Do not make this about-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Fianna Fáil set it up. I fixed it, as much as I could.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The First Minister is extremely welcome and I am delighted to address her on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad. The international labour movement has perhaps had an uncomfortable relationship with national movements in the past. Indeed, our own founder, James Connolly, who was from Edinburgh, once said one could change the symbols of a state but that would never be enough. The First Minister's own national movement for self-determination contains much to admire, certainly in this part of the world where we have seen such sectarian tension, violence and bloodshed. The First Minister's movement for national self-determination has seen none of those things and, in fact, the referendum two years ago was inspiring for us in Ireland to witness. There was a fantastic engagement, in particular with young people, and the vote did not become in any way a sectarian headcount. Rather, it became something that has perhaps unified Scotland. As somebody who is deeply worried about trends across Europe and the world, I find it inspiring to be in the First Minister's presence today. I see what is happening in the USA, Britain and across Europe, but when I hear the First Minister speak, I am inspired that things can perhaps get better. The very first issue she raised in the House today was the refugee crisis. I find that deeply moving. I find the fact that she is so in touch with her own history, our history and our responsibility to that history incredibly moving and inspiring. While nationalism across Europe now has a very bad name, the First Minister's nationalism and her sense of her nation's history is to be greatly commended. I admire her stance on things like TTIP and marriage equality. I admire her determination not to allow her country, the UK and the rest of Europe break away from what has been a good and honourable movement since the mid-1940s.Let us remind ourselves that the European Union arose at a time of great division, war, pain, death and suffering. It appears that it is now turning in on itself on the basis, in respect of the Brexit campaign, of a racist lie on the part of those who pretend to care about public services but who really have a xenophobic heart. The Scottish First Minister is ranged against it, for which we commend her. At this time of great uncertainty and fear, a time when people are facing off against each other and leadership is needed, she is a shining light not only on these islands and across Europe but also across the world. As the inevitable reaches its conclusion and Scotland takes its place among the nations of the world and its self-determination becomes a reality, it should know that in these Houses and this country it will have the closest of allies, not just on the basis of national self-determination but also because of what we must give to the world, namely, our belief systems and values. At this historic juncture, what people in Ireland and Scotland believe in is more important than ever before. I congratulate the Scottish First Minister on her address and offer her our solidarity.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I second the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate Senator Martin Conway on putting the motion together. Those of us on the Opposition benches are at a terrible disadvantage whenever the Senator says anything, promotes anything or drafts a motion because it is very difficult to debate with somebody with whom one tends to agree most of the time on the stances he takes, his opinions and the effort he makes. I commend him again for the effort he put into the motion. I also welcome the Minister. When the debate on history in the junior certificate cycle kicked off a number of years ago, it was like alternative facts, as one-liners became instant conversations about the downgrading of history and it was said it would no longer be compulsory. As has been said by speakers across the House, it has never been officially compulsory. It is compulsory in approximately 50% of schools. I will throw out some statistics which might be of interest to those taking part in the debate. They were given to the education committee when the topic came up a number of years ago.  An official from the Department gave the following statistics. Approximately 54,000 students per year study junior certificate history and junior certificate geography, but when it comes to the leaving certificate, approximately 23,000 continue to study leaving certificate geography, whereas 13,002 study leaving certificate history. Approximately 20% of those who study junior certificate history will continue to study leaving certificate history. We can plough on and do things as we have always done them and pretend everything is wonderful, or we can try to change them. Clearly, if one feels passionately about history and its importance and not repeating the mistakes of history, one should aspire to having more students take history to leaving certificate level. From these basic statistics for the numbers of students taking the subject at leaving certificate level, we have a major problem. Why are students being turned off the subject? Why does it not inspire them? Why are other subjects considered to be more important? This is something that deserves imagination and investigation. There must be autonomy for schools in various parts of the country to teach history in various ways. In a primary school I taught the history of housing policy, tuberculosis and the heroin epidemic, which were much more relevant than they would be in another part of the country. In another part of the country the history of the islands, the Gaeltacht or farming policy might be much more relevant than other topics from an urban perspective. The junior certificate programme offers an opportunity to allow students to investigate something relevant to them and which they may not have not an opportunity to investigate previously and make obvious how history impacts on their day to day lives and how they can learn when debating and discussing contemporaneous issues that there is always an historical context to everything. I was fascinated by what Senator Frank Feighan said about Gallipoli. As he rightly said, Gallipoli should be a term, battle, word and place that resonates with every Irish child and every Irish man or woman because 4,000 Irish men died there 100 years ago. One of them was my great grand-uncle. We did not know about it as children growing up. We were much more in tune with the republican side. As has been said, history can be divisive. There are more than two sides to any historical discussion and generally the discussions have a shade of ten or 12 opinions. There are stories in Irish history which go untold. We have a very linear historical background, whereby one event happens and then another. Things have happened in this city - I have mentioned the heroin epidemic of the late 1970s - which are much more relevant to children today than the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland of the late 1960s. I am not saying they should be competing themes or discussions in the classroom, but children need to be aware of both. We should also not have divides such that people from one part of the country with no knowledge of the background to housing policy, drug policy or how tuberculosis was such a killer in the city in the 1940s will be exposed to it and discover an interest in it in order that when it comes to debating national policy perspectives and priorities, they will come to it with a much wider view. I am an urban-based politician and if I had gained in school a greater knowledge of rural sensitivities, I might have a better chance of having a more rounded opinion. We are debating education. When we try to change how something has always happened in education, people get upset. We cannot touch Irish language policy without being called something akin to Cromwell. If we suggest we change the way Irish is taught or imposed on children who do not have any interest in it, we receive quite a number of cranky e-mails from people throughout the country. If we attempt to change any subject close to people's hearts such as history, accusations will be thrown around the place about one's motivations. I will say again - it is something to which the Minister should refer - if only 20% of students at leaving certificate level study a subject which the vast majority of pupils study at junior certificate level, clearly we are not doing the job we should be doing. It is not inspiring young people in the way it should. Perhaps it is not as relevant to them as it should be. If we allow autonomy for schools to focus part of their time on issues particularly relevant to their geographical areas, as well as opening the minds of the students to other points of view and other traditions in other parts of the country, we will have more rounded students and people with opinions based on fact and sensitivity regarding from where people come.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister. I join others in expressing my thanks to the former deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, for the journey he has taken and his commitment and work in the past few years. I wish Michelle O'Neill, MLA, the very best in her new role. I disagree with Senator Neale Richmond in his belief the British Government will act in good faith in meeting its responsibilities as co-guarantor to the Good Friday Agreement. I watch the debate and I am outraged by the complete and utter indifference of the British Government and the Brexit campaigners to their responsibilities to this island. They are a massive part of the problems on this island for a very long time. Now it appears that we are almost completely indifferent to their negotiations and thought processes. It was very decent of the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, to place us at No. 4 on her list of 12 items of concern. It is possible that the Minister had some role in that regard, on which he is to be congratulated. If it was to be seen in the cold light of day as to where we stood in her thought processes, she had an historic opportunity to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to speak in the Dáil Chamber and express her commitment and that of the British Government to meeting their responsibilities on this island, but she decided not to do so. I have a deep distaste for hardline nationalism. It bores me to tears. I am not necessarily looking forward to the debates in the North when the electioneering begins because I find hardline nationalism particularly tedious. There are other issues in Northern Ireland to discuss. I was very taken by a speech made by Colum Eastwood, MLA, on the child poverty rate and the numbers of adults in west Belfast who had no formal qualifications. Other speakers have mentioned marriage equality and other social issues that rarely get an airing. I attended a meeting in Belfast before Christmas on the issue of drugs. There are serious social issues such as equality that need to be addressed. The hardline nationalistic stances on either side of the debate are the ones that come to the fore. It is the hardline nationalist instinct in the United Kingdom which is at the centre of the debate on Brexit. It is the campaigning zeal of those in favour of Brexit that has led to Britain walking away from its historical responsibilities in Europe as a whole and off the stage in meeting its responsibilities here. We have had 20 years - perhaps longer - in which everything we said about the United Kingdom and our relationship with it was couched in friendly terminology. It was important to do so. It was important and responsible that Irish Governments and those representing the State did not say anything that would have inflamed tensions or made things worse, particularly when lives were at risk. However, there comes a stage when one has to call a spade a spade. When the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street is pandering to the worst excesses of British nationalism, we must call it out. The new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom had a fantastic opportunity to come to the Houses to speak to Members about the Good Friday Agreement, her commitment to it and the fact that Brexit would not impact necessarily on peace on this island, but she is reportedly refusing to do so. I suggest it is important for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as a representative of the Government, to speak in frank terms about our dismay that Ireland and Northern Ireland are not on the real priority list for the Prime Minister and her Government and also when overseeing and commenting on events in Northern Ireland in the coming period say it is social issues, including equality and empowerment, the issues beyond orange and green, that will come to the fore. It is time to put to one side the niceties of language and the pretence of friendship because if one cannot speak frankly to people who are walking away from their historical responsibilities, we are doing the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland a disservice. This is not about a flag waving blame game. I am the last person in the world who would stand with a Tricolour and fly it in somebody's face to try to score a nationalistic point off them. That is not me. It worries me to the bone that such a powerful country with such historical responsibilities to a place on which it has had a significant impact for centuries does not give a thought to it and does not take the opportunity to settle nerves about its intentions. I would like the Minister to respond to my remarks. I understand he has responsibility for this ministry and his words carry weight. That is very important. It is important that Members speak frankly about the direction the Prime Minister and her Government are taking in dealing with the situation in Northern Ireland and issues that affect the entire island of Ireland.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am proud to support Senator Gerald Nash's Bill. I congratulate him on the work he has done to bring this important legislation before the House. At its heart is an essential understanding of what equality really means. Equality is not a sense that one privileged group in society can hand down rights to another in society. That is not what equality means. It is not in the gift of one group to allow another to be themselves. Equality is very different. It is an understanding we are all equal in every sense and that if any group are deemed or perceived to be lesser, we will do everything in our power to override, undermine, fix and change that understanding. In the past few years when the Labour Party was in government with Fine Gael, we managed to achieve quite a number of things in the sphere of LGBT rights. Marriage equality is an obvious one, as is the Children and Family Relationships Act. There are now mandatory anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic policies in all schools and we also passed the Gender Recognition Act and amended section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. These were five commitments made by the Labour Party which were achieved in government. What we are doing is acknowledging that while we have achieved a huge amount in the recent years, we must right the wrongs of the past. We have to admit that our legislative provisions before 1993 were wrong and that they undermined people's rights. We have to acknowledge this as a state and apologise for it. The legislative provisions at the time and the constitutional provisions, until very recently, made people feel that they were lesser beings. They made people feel second best, not full and complete parts of this republic. I say this in the context of the current situation worldwide because often we can be quite complacent about the advancement of human rights and the equality agenda in this state and across Europe. As we look around the world today, we see the new political dispensation in Russia and the new political situation in the USA, where the Vice President has stated openly his belief LGBT people can be corrected by some bizarre form of medical intervention. That is the new political dynamic we are facing in the United States of America. We are saying quite clearly in Seanad Éireann today that this republic, on the edge of Europe, believes not only do LGBT people not need to be corrected but that the fact that LGBT people were not full, complete and equal members of this republic in the past is something for which we must apologise. We must be absolutely determined to ensure we will advance this agenda further. It is not correct to suggest that because we had a successful marriage equality referendum or because other legislation has been passed - even this valuable Bill - it will make it easy for members of the LGBT community to come to terms with themselves and come out to their family and friends in various parts of Ireland. There is, unfortunately, still a very dark road ahead for many young and not-so-young people who still feel as if they are living in an Ireland that does not accept them. It is like saying that because the Civil Rights Act was passed in America in the 1960s, African Americans are completely equal in the eyes of all citizens and states in America. That is not the case.  What we must do in this republic and the Houses of the Oireachtas is ensure every single Bill that we can pass or Act that we can correct is so passed or corrected. We must also apologise for the wrongs of the past. Just like Senator Gerald Nash, I sat my leaving certificate examinations in the early 1990s. It is unbelievable to think that at the very same time my contemporaries or people older than me were criminalised for being who they were and for the love they felt. I know that the younger generation - those younger than us - find that absolutely unbelievable. What was remarkable at the time of the referendum was the fact that young people, regardless of background, gender or from where they came, found it remarkable that before 1993, engaging in homosexual activity was a criminal act.I know that the Minister of State feels strongly about this issue. I congratulate him for the work he has done heretofore in his equality brief. We have met on a number of occasions to discuss various issues. He is a person with a deep commitment to equality. As Senator Gerald Nash said, when issues such as this come before the House, there is often a temptation for Governments to pick holes in things. There is sometimes a temptation for Opposition parties to play politics. In this instance, the Minister of State will acknowledge that Senator Gerald Nash has brought forward legislation that is well crafted and has the right motivation behind it. What the Minister of State and his office can do is take it in that spirit and if it needs to be tweaked, changed or improved, that ccould be done at a different stage of the legislative process.  The Members of this House can stand together proudly, collectively and across party, in this republic and send a message to the rest of the world. Let us not pretend that this agenda is going in the same direction in every single part of the world because it is not. It is going backwards. It is going backwards in America, Russia and across the world in many respects. If this House was to restate its absolute commitment to equality for our LGBT brothers and sisters across this land, it would be a powerful symbol at this time. I commend Senator Gerald Nash for the work he has done and my Labour Party colleagues for supporting the Bill. I commend Senators across the House who are standing in solidarity with the Bill and the Minister of State's endeavours to bring this issue to the fore. It will mean an awful lot for people who lived in the shadows before 1993. None of us can understand what a measure such as this passed in the House today will mean for people who lived in those dark days.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I formally second the amendment.  In six weeks' time this country and the world will celebrate the history and the story of a very famous undocumented migrant called St. Patrick. On that day and in that week it is imperative that we in this House and anybody with an Irish background tell the real story of Ireland. It is a story of emigration, an understanding of coffin ships, sectarian hatred, seeking refuge, violence and terrorism.It is extremely important, while the eyes of the world are on us, that we take a stand on that day and in that week and tell the real story of Ireland. In these very uncertain times, particularly following the executive orders produced by the Trump regime, the number of people with Irish-American names who surround the man is remarkable. I can think of names like Conway, Kelly, Bannon, Spicer and Pence. They want to give a certain view of the Irish-American experience. It is important that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and Irish people across the world take a stand on St. Patrick's Day and in that week. We must remind the world that we know intimately what it is like to leave this country, what it meant to be on a coffin ship and takes to overcome sectarian hatred, deal with terrorism and division and seek peace. We must take stock of the experience in our own country.  I make reference to the recent goings on in Ballaghaderreen when local representatives were shown up completely by local people when asked to accept 80 Syrian refugees into their own community. I pay tribute to Mary Gallagher who I believe owns a small shop in Ballaghaderreen. When asked by RTE how she felt about the situation, she asked how, when one saw children being picked out of clay, could one say no. However, political representatives in that part of the world were slow in being as welcoming as she was. We in this House have a responsibility to work on a cross-party basis to ensure we will implement the recommendations made in the McMahon report on direct provision. We now have an opportunity to sort out our own house. We can say to the rest of the world that we are an emigrant nation, that we understand intimately the needs of emigrants across the world and that we will not allow the Irish story to be hijacked by the right-wing white national viewpoint of those who surround President Trump.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the Minister coming to talk about judicial appointments or-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh Gníomhach. Lá breá brothallach a bhí ann. Chuaigh mé féin agus mo chlann go dtí an trá. Bhí an ghrian ag taitneamh sa spéir. D'itheamar uachtar reoite. Chuamar abhaile agus d'inis mé an scéal ar fad do mo Mhamaí. Dá gcuirfí ceist ar an gnáthdhuine in Éirinn, déarfainn gurb iad sin na príomhabairtí gur féidir leo labhairt trí Ghaeilge tar éis dóibh 14 bliana a bheith ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ar scoil. Ní cúis ionaidh é ach is cúis díoma é sin do mo leithéidse a chaith tréimhse mhaith ag foghlaim na Gaeilge. Idir bhunscoil agus mheanscoil Béarla a bhí mar scoil agamsa ach d'fhreastal mé ar Ghaelscoil ar feadh bliain amháin agus mé sa seú rang. Rinne mé céim sa Ghaeilge sa triú leibhéal. Is í an fhadhb atá ann ná fadhb mheoin nó fadhb dhearcaidh, is é sin an dearcadh atá ag na foghlaimeoirí. Tá siad beag beann ar an nGaeilge mar ábhar. B'fhéidir go bhfuil fadhb ann ó thaobh an mhodha mhúinte atá againn sa chóras. É sin leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ruane ó thaobh múinteoirí de ó áiteanna faoi mhíbhuntáiste. Aontaím go huile is go hiomlán léi. Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire Stáit, ó thaobh scéim atá curtha ar bun agamsa, ag Marino Institute of Education agus ag Northside Partnership i mo cheantar féin, go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh seans ag daltaí faoi mhíbhuntáise agus atá ag freastal ar scoileanna DEIS a bheith mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Tá an Ghaeilge ag feidhmiú mar chonstaic dóibhsean. Ní fhaigheann siad an deis uaireanta sna scoileanna sin Gaeilge ardleibhéil a dhéanamh toisc nach bhfuil na múinteoirí ann chun an leibhéal sin a thabhairt dóibh. Ní hamháin sin ach ní bhíonn an bhéim curtha ar chursaí Gaeilge sna gnáthbunscoile faoi míbhuntáiste, mar is iad an litríocht agus an Béarla na rudaí is tábhachtaí. Tá an Ghaeilge curtha síos an liosta ó thaobh na rudaí atá tábhachtach. Tá sé mar mhíbhuntáiste ag na daltaí sin agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh má tá siad ag iarraidh a bheith mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Mar sin, an fhadhb atá ann i láthair na huaire ná go bhfuil gnáthdaoine meanaicme atá againne mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Tá an ról sin agus an ionsparáid sin, go bhféadfadh páistí ó na scoileanna sin a thabhairt do pháistí eile i scoileanna DEIS, caillte againn. Sin í an fhadhb atá ann. Tá scéim curtha ar bun againne i Marino ceachtanna Gaeilge a thabhairt do dhaltaí meanscoile ionas go mbeidh siad in ann Gaeilge ardteistiméireachta a dhéanamh ar ardleibhéal ionas go bhféadfadh siad dul ar aghaidh sna coláistí traenála. Tá meon eile atá tábhachtach a athrú maidir leis an gceist seo agus sin meon na nGaeilgeoirí. Má chuirtear smaoineamh eile chun cinn ó thaobh an dóigh gur féidir an córas sin a athrú, faightear teachtaireachtaí ó fud na tíre go bhfuil Cromwell eile tagtha ar an bhfód a bhfuil ag iarraidh cosc a chur ar ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge. Is é an caighdéan atá ag múinteoirí agus iad ag fágáil na coláistí traenála atá i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná an caighdeán Gaeilge a bheadh acusan agus iad ag dul isteach sna coláistí sin. Sin an pointe atá mé ag iarraidh é a dhéanamh. Níl an cheist faoi chúrsaí Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí Gaeilge. Is é an ról atá ag an Aire Stáit, is dócha, an Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn, tionscail a tharraingt chun na Gaeltachta agus fostaíocht a aimsiú don Ghaeltacht agus mar sin de. Is sórt forbartha réigiúnaí atá i gceist ag an Aire Stáit. Is ceist iomlán difriúil cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Má táimid chun bheith dáiríre faoin teanga is teip mhór mhillteach í múineadh na Gaeilge agus múineadh teanga i gcoitinne inár gcóras. Tá smaoineamh agam don Aire Stáit faoin ngnáthscoil bunleibhéal. Dá ndéanfaimis rang a dó agus rang a trí go huile is go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge as seo amach i ngach aon scoil, cén sórt caighdeán Gaeilge a bheadh ag gach dalta scoile agus iad ag fágáil na scoile? Nó b'fhéidir rang a haon agus rang a dó. In ionad dream ag fáil caighdeáin mhaith sna Gaelscoileanna agus dream eile ag fáil drochchaighdeáin sna gnáthscoileanna. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ró-réabhlóideach mar smaoineamh. Ach má táimid dáiríre faoi cheist na Gaeilge, dá mbeadh seans ag gach aon dalta gach uile ábhar a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge i rang a dó agus rang a trí, bheadh caighdeán iontach níos fearr agus níos saibhre Gaeilge acu agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh chuig an cúigiú rang, an séú rang agus an meánscoil. Téann sé ar aghaidh go dtí na ceisteanna ó thaobh fhoghlaim teangacha i gcoitinne, ar nós Fraincís, Spáinis agus Gearmáinis. Is teip mhór mhillteach í sin inár gcóras chomh mhaith ó thaobh na dteangacha eile sin. Ritheann sé liom nach bhfuilimid dáiríre faoi theangacha a mhúineadh i gceart. Tá mé chun críochnú anois. Tá dhá rud gur maith liom a rá arís, go bhfuil constaic agus teorainn, nó balla más maith leat, ansin atá curtha i dtreo páistí bochta atá ag iarraidh a bheith mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile. Is í an Ghaeilge chuid den bhalla sin agus caithfimid bheith ionraic agus macánta faoi sin. Agus sa chóras i gcoitinne, caithfimid bheith i bhfad níos réabhlóidí. B'fhéidir dá ndéanfaimis an rud ar fad trí Ghaeilge i rang a dó, rang a trí agus rang a ceathair nó cibé rang ar feadh bliana go mbeadh seans i bhfad níos fearr ann an fhadhb seo a réiteach.Caithfidh lucht na Gaeilge gan a bheith chomh ardnósach sin agus gan teachtaireachtaí a chur chugamsa agus chuig daoine eile. Tá fáth ann go nglaoitear an Taliban orthu. Is cuma cén sórt plé a bhíonn ag duine faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge, mura n-aontaíonn sé nó sí go huile is go hiomlán leis na tuairimí atá acusan ó thaobh ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge, is ionann an duine sin agus Cromwell. Faighimse na e-mails seo. Tá an meon atá acu dochreidte. Is féidir leo fanacht mar sin, is féidir leo leanúint leis an meon sin, ach ní chabhraíonn sé le gluaiseacht na Gaeilge. É sin ráite, is beag seans go mbeidh mé ag dul go dtí an trá inniu, toisc go bhfuil an lá chomh uafásach sin, ach beidh mé ag insint an scéil seo ar fad de mo Mhamaí ar ball.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not know what to say after the previous contribution. I seem to remember the very same voice in this Chamber on the day after the American presidential election saying we needed to get used to the new world order and that the era of political correctness was over. A congratulatory message was sent from the same individual to the newly elected President. I am delighted we have had such a Pauline conversion to the realities of the new regime in America. That is not the reason I am contributing. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, on her achievement yesterday in getting the medically supervised injection centre proposal through the Cabinet.This incredibly important legislation being shepherded by the Minister of State ill save lives. Often in the Chamber we debate health and public policy issues, but, as this legislation comes to the House, I appeal to all parties that I know support the legislation to do so robustly and without fear because the issue of street heroin injection means we are dealing with the most vulnerable of citizens. I was involved in the formulation of the legislation in the previous Government and I am delighted to see the Government has taken it on. It is in the programme for Government and being delivered. It is not the role of people in opposition to pick holes in Government policy all the time. We will oppose when necessary, but we will also support when necessary. The Minister of State is to be congratulated. It is a proud day for her and the Oireachtas that our drug policy is becoming much more enlightened. She is doing an excellent job in that regard. I hope to stand in the Chamber and see the legislation go through the House in the coming weeks.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Níl-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«An Talibán. Tá difríocht ann.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to support Senator Gavan in his remarks on industrial disputes that are ongoing today. The Tesco issue is one that I feel quite strongly about. This does not have to be a divisive issue in this Chamber and I want to echo the call for the Minister in charge of this area to come to the House to talk about her vision for workers' rights in Ireland. Over the course of the last five years, on a statutory and legislative basis, Ireland is the only country in Europe to have had improvements in workers' rights, thanks in no small way to the efforts of my colleague, Senator Nash. However, regardless of discussions in the transport area where management is talking about profit margins, unsustainability and all the rest of it, it is quite galling to see that we have a huge multinational organisation, Tesco, making massive profits in this country and yet trying to pit one worker against another. It is quite gratifying and inspirational to see the voices of workers who are willing to step outside their own area of employment and to put their necks on the block for their fellow workers because of what management is doing.Let us be honest about this. Across parties in this Chamber, we have an opportunity to talk about the vision we have for work, for the future of work and for the rights that underpin that work. The European Union, of which we are a proud member, has helped in that endeavour. I join my Sinn Féin colleague in calling for the Minister to come to the House to outline her vision, if she has one. This will not go away; these disputes will continue. Media will always second-guess the motivations of workers and unions. At this point it is appropriate for the Minister to come and articulate in this Chamber whatever vision she may have. We can collectively underpin that agenda in this Chamber to ensure we stand for something much more basic and important than profit margins.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is very welcome. I welcome the clarity of her statement, which is no less than I would have expected from somebody of the Minister's integrity.She is well known in this country as a politician with great integrity and honesty and her stature has been reinforced this week. After the week's events, I find that hers is one of the only voices in the Government I can believe. Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot believe a blind word that comes from the mouth of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste. I was previously a primary school principal. We stored files in the school and the place where the filing cabinet held them was probably the most sacred in the entire school. Nobody had access to it; nobody went near it and nobody was allowed to take anything out of the filing cabinet without making sure it would be put straight back in again. Anybody who gained access to the room was strictly overseen by me and people working with me. That a cut-and-paste effort in the case of one child could be misplaced in a file on another is absolutely unthinkable in a small primary school with 100 children. Of all the files in all the world, it is just not credible that a cut-and-paste effort could find its way into Sergeant Maurice McCabe's file. The problem, as alluded to by Senator Rose Conway-Walsh, is that citizens now believe the State will find a way to take them down if it considers they are a threat. I can appreciate the difficulties the Minister is having because my party and I went through this for five years in dealing with shambolic handling of justice issue after justice issue. We had to keep the show on the road because there was an economic crisis and it was not worth plunging the country into a general election because of the nature of what we were dealing with. However, we had a Minister for justice on the bloody television leaking bits of information on what he knew about how a Dáil Deputy had behaved in using his mobile phone at traffic lights. Then the Taoiseach effectively fired the Garda Commissioner without telling anybody in either party in government, including the Tánaiste. It was absolutely outrageous. We had to drag Fine Gael Members kicking and screaming into accepting any concession or change in the justice portfolio. They did not want to know about the proposal to establish a policing authority until they were shamed into accepting it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They had no comprehension of what equality and justice really meant. It is polling company stuff. That was our experience in government. Fundamentally, Fine Gael does not have an instinct for what is just and right until it reaches the point of disaster and no return. Now Brexit does not matter. Various reports are under consideration in the Houses today that would put Ministers under pressure at any other time. I genuinely do not want to say this, but I can no longer believe a word that comes out of the Taoiseach's mouth.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach's presentation of what has happened in the past few days is just not credible.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The media performances of other members of the Government in the past few days are just not credible. What we are dealing with is a family whose names have been destroyed. There are people wondering why anyone would bother being a whistleblower. They are asking themselves what would happen if they were to see a great injustice or a terrible wrong being done in the institution in which they are working and why they should bother to stand up. They are saying to themselves that the agencies of the State would pick them off and do them down. The very people in public life who are supposed to defend individuals in these situations cannot remember, pretend that they cannot remember or give a presentation of events which cannot be believed. I have absolute faith in the Minister before us and her presentation on what has happened in the past few days. I commend her for being willing to meet the McCabe family, signing them in at Leinster House - there was nothing private about it - and standing with them again today. I also commend her for her statements, but I know what she is dealing with.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Until senior members of the Government cop on to the fact that in this republic it is "justice be done though the heavens fall", we will return to this issue time and again.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House, and on behalf of the Labour Party we want to support the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry and the terms of reference as laid down. We have had a turbulent week and it gives myself and my party, considering our position in opposition, absolutely no satisfaction whatsoever to see what has happened in recent days. An Garda Síochána is again in the midst of a huge controversy. Tusla has been dragged into it as well. Public confidence in an Garda Síochána has been shaken to the core. I made this point last night but I will repeat it in the Tánaiste's presence. That the public could feel, on any level at all, that if they see a wrong or stand up against an injustice within the organisation or the entity in which they work that they could be taken down with the most vile accusation put against their name is unacceptable. It would be easy for an Opposition party like Labour to say that this has been rushed and that we do not agree with it, that not enough time was put into the terms of reference - clearly that was done - or to reject what has been done. We are not going to do that. Not only has what has happened shaken the public's confidence in An Garda Síochána and Tusla, the Tánaiste's and the Taoiseach's presentations of events over the last week are just not credible. It gives me absolutely no satisfaction to say that but, unfortunately, it is the reality. Like many people in this House, I have family members in the Garda. It is a fine force and deserves to have the support of the public. However, we cannot go through a situation where a culture of defensiveness creeps in. A young garda who has joined the force and who is putting his or her body on the line in the defence of the public needs to know that he or she has the absolute trust and confidence of the people. That is necessary because the type of accusation that has been made about the culture within the force hurts them. Many in this House will be aware of the various dark arts that are sometimes employed by members of An Garda Síochána. The dark arts are not exclusive to the force. There are people in this House who know all about the dark arts, as do other entities and organisations in this country as well. The confidence of the people in the police force is absolutely central to a functioning democracy. I trust and hope that this tribunal will help us recover that. I want to ask the Tánaiste a straight question which she did not answer this afternoon when my party leader, Deputy Howlin, asked it. Can the Tánaiste confirm to this House that she has already or will today issue a directive to the Garda Commissioner under section 25 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to secure the preservation of all Garda records and equipment that may be relevant to this inquiry and to safeguard evidence? I ask that direct question because my colleague, Deputy Howlin, asked it earlier and did not receive a response. This is a dark episode. It is not a matter with which anyone in my party wants to play politics but it is a depressing chapter in this Government's history. My honest view is that it will be seen in time to be the beginning of the end of this Administration. If one of the Tánaiste's final acts in her position is to establish this tribunal of inquiry and if, as a result of the work of that tribunal, the truth is found and faith restored in such crucial institutions of the State, then that will have been a good day's work.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I acknowledge and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and his officials who I know well and also those in the Visitors Gallery who have been affected so personally by this issue of murder. The contribution of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell was very impressive. I congratulate her for introducing this Bill because it allows us to discuss the issue of murder. In fairness, as I stand here in opposition to the Bill, I do so in an attempt to give a nuanced point of view, which does not in any way mean that I or people who have a similar point of view, as has been articulated already, are in any way not aware of the effects of murder, that it is a life sentence for the families of the victims of murder, and that nobody wants to send a message to society that murder should not be punished. However, we have to deal with realities.  Ireland currently has a mandatory life sentence for murder. Just ten EU member states have mandatory life sentences for murder, others have minimum sentences ranging from ten years. A life sentence always lasts for life although the portion of the sentence served in prison can vary. If released from prison, the person remains under licence and can be recalled at any time for breach of conditions. This Bill seeks to introduce minimum custodial periods that must be served in prison before release on parole can be considered. There are benefits to bringing clarity and certainty to the portion of the life sentence that a prisoner can be expected to spend in prison. There is a life sentence already. What is at issue and what we are discussing is the portion of that life sentence which is spent in prison. The basis for the starting point of 25, 30 and 40 years in the Bill is unclear. These starting points would put Ireland at the more punitive end of the range in Europe, as has been said by my colleague in the Fianna Fáil Party, and more in line with Russia, Poland, Estonia and Moldova than western European jurisdictions such as Denmark. Minimum sentences are not averages. A sentence of 25 years is one of the highest minimum periods that would be enforced in Europe. In Ireland, life sentence prisoners can apply for parole at seven years but would have no realistic prospect of release until at least 15 years have been served.The average time currently served, as the proposer of the Bill has pointed out, is 17.5 years. If we are talking about trying to deter people from committing a murder, if somebody expects to serve 17.5 years or 25 years, I am not sure that factor will be considered by somebody intent on committing this crime.  Average time served by people sentenced to life imprisonment increased from 11 years in 2002 to a peak of 22 years in 2012 and 17.5 years in 2015. The length of time served is increasing. However, due to the low number - between one and six - of life sentence prisoners who are released every year, the average length of time does not give a clear picture. For example, in 2012 a prisoner died in hospital having served 36 years of a life sentence. In 2013 a life sentence prisoner was released having served 13 years. The circumstances were very different in those two cases. There are approximately 355 people in prison in Ireland serving life sentences, not all for murder. Some 12 of these are female.  This is probably not a very popular point but it is one that is important to put on the record of the House. The impact of this Bill on prison and justice resources, indirectly and unintentionally, would be immense. My view is that it would be far better to invest resources in crime prevention than punishment. I often make the point that in New York, planning for prison spaces required in 15 years time involves looking at the literacy rates of 11 year olds. In circumstances were people are grieving for lost loved ones because of murder, the circumstances or the conditions of a life that lead a person to commit a murder is the least of their concerns, but in the overall sense it is an important point which needs to be made in this debate, which is only happening because of the Bill that was put forward by my colleague.  Life sentence prisoners are a huge drain on prison resources due to particular needs over a longer time. If one gets a life sentence, it is a life sentence. What we are debating here is the period of time of that life sentence that is spent in prison.  Proposals that should be considered instead of this Bill, which are backed by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, are that delayed proposed changes to presumptive minimum custodial periods under conviction for murder should take place within the context of parole reform as per commitments by successive Ministers for Justice. In 2014 the cross-agency Department of Justice and Equality's strategic review on penal policy, which included victim representative groups, recommended that a minimum term before parole can be considered should be set out in statute that more accurately reflects the expectations of offender and society. The review group expected that this would be achieved within legislation establishing a parole board on a statutory basis.  I commend the proposer of the Bill for her passion in bringing forward this debate to the House. Those of us with a nuanced view of this issue are not in any way trying to suggest that we are soft on crime or soft on murder, but we want to deal with the realities of the situation. Opponents of the Bill are not in any way trying to diminish the suffering or the pain that has been felt and experienced by those in the Visitors Gallery today and throughout Ireland who have been victims of murder. Most people in this House would have been to the funerals of murder victims, as I have been myself. We have to deal with this in the round and speak honestly. We have to speak as legislators. While congratulating the Senator on bringing this Bill to the House, because we would not be having this debate if it was not for her initiative, I and my party will be opposing the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I rise to raise two issues, one that has been raised on a number of occasions in this House, which has a campaigning zeal in it. It is an issue I raised directly with the Taoiseach when he was last in this House and I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is working steadily on it, namely, direct provision. This is not a divisive issue in this House. In fact, it is not a divisive issue in this Parliament. It is to our great credit as an Oireachtas that we do not have any political party or individual who plays the race card or who is advocating an approach other than a humanitarian one to the issue. It would be beneficial for this House to have the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, come to the House to give us his perspective on the progress of the implementation of the McMahon report. Members of all parties in this House would appreciate that opportunity and I call on the Deputy Leader to facilitate such a debate. The second point I wish to make, with the greatest respect, is in complete contradiction to what Senator Craughwell said. I find the current situation unbelievable given that we face into the teeth of Brexit negotiations which are very worrying and will have huge implications for this country. I held a public meeting in my constituency last night and some of the statistics that have been given by the European movement suggest that a worst-case scenario could result in the loss of 400,000 jobs in this country. The agrifood sector is under great pressure. A total of 20% of jobs in Cavan, Monaghan, Wexford and Waterford are dependent on the agrifood sector. In 2008 the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, went on a prolonged lap of honour while the country was on fire and I do not think it is appropriate for the current Taoiseach to do the same. He should be reminded that he is not just the leader of Fine Gael, he is the leader of this country. While the rest of us are fascinated with the personality competition that is going on at the moment between various individuals in the Fine Gael Party, what is happening in this country is much more important than the future leadership of that great Christian democratic movement in Ireland. What we need is a leader who can lead us into the Brexit negotiations and we do not need another lap of honour. My colleagues in Fine Gael can pant, tut and make all the noises they want but the reality is that this Chamber represents the entire country and when the Taoiseach was here last year he made a commitment to come back by the end of 2016. It is fair enough if his diary was full but every Member of this House would appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the Taoiseach the ongoing Brexit negotiations and to implore him not to go on a prolonged lap of honour and to take his responsibility as Taoiseach seriously in order that we face into the situation collectively as a country rather than from a partisan, party-political point of view. I am terribly sorry if my Fine Gael colleagues are offended by my remarks.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Charmer.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State and appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. As with most Senators, I have family members abroad. Most Members will recall the dark days of the 1980s when contact was made via long distance telephone calls and we welcomed our emigrants home at Christmas time. It is often said that the cameras are always rolling in Dublin Airport at Christmas time when emigrants are returning but they rarely capture the images of heartbreak as people leave on flights to Britain or the United States in the new year.I am fully conversant with that situation and know exactly what it is like to have an empty chair at the table. It is a difficult reality that almost every family in Ireland has been through at one stage or another. I have a brother living in Canada and a sister in London.  We now find ourselves between Trump and Brexit. Trump's executive orders are fundamentally xenophobic and patently racist. On the other hand, we have a Brexit debate which is centred around the issue of immigration. We have an international, historic and moral obligation to tell the world the story of the Irish people. As we approach St. Patrick's Day and enter the most powerful rooms in the world, with Ministers travelling around the world, we need to reiterate the fact that Ireland knows better than anybody about emigration. We had a country of coffin ships with people seeking refuge as they fled conflict. Our country knows exactly what the suppression of rights is all about.  At this historic moment in time, the first St. Patrick's Day since Brexit and Trump, we have a moral and historic obligation to stand for something that is more profound than our own diaspora. Senator Lawless and myself have been working with the Migrant Rights Centre to correlate two issues: the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the United States; and the 26,000 undocumented workers here. Both issues are the very same - there is absolutely no difference between them. We who have been working on that project stand in solidarity with those who feel fearful at this time of great uncertainty.  Almost 50 years ago, in April 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, Martin Luther King made his anti-Vietnam war speech. He said: "Yes, we must stand and we must speak." On St. Patrick's Day in that iconic venue there will be an event called "Irish Stand" at 7.30 p.m. that evening, featuring writers, actors and activists. The gathering will include people from the Waking the Feminist movement, the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as Colum McCann, Richard Schiff, Shaun King, Maeve Higgins and myself. I am calling on the Irish community in New York and elsewhere across America to support it. At the moment it is not good enough for us to speak only about our own diaspora because people across the world are facing into this new political reality. They are fearful, but they need to know that there is a country which lies between the great traditional powers of Britain and America whose people have a story to tell. It is deeper than just having a St. Patrick's Day parade. It is about the human condition, interconnectivity and realising that our forebears had to flee this land, while others are doing the very same today. On St. Patrick's Day it is our historic and moral responsibility to take that stand. I want everybody in this House to realise that there are people willing, able and ready to do so.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Government and the Taoiseach and, in particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton. Last night's events in Leinster House were particularly emotional, particularly for anybody who witnessed what happened in the Dáil. After years of people complaining, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government and the State, formally recognised the ethnicity of the Traveller community. What happened is great credit to a number of people in this House. In particular, I want to mention Senator Mac Lochlainn who, along with me and others, pursued this issue through the offices of what was then the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in recent years. The Senator produced a report for the committee which advocated in favour of ethnicity being recognised. The report in question enjoyed cross-party support. What was wonderful about last night, and many here might agree, was that a debate on any Traveller issue in this House or in the Lower House 20 years ago would not necessarily have involved people speaking with one voice. However, last night every political leader from every political party was absolutely in agreement with the statement that was made. It was incredibly emotional. I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. Senator Kelleher, Senator Mac Lochlainn and I have been meeting the Minister of State regularly over the past year, encouraging him and getting updates on progress in respect of what he was trying to achieve, and he did it. He is to be commended for that. For those who may have had an academic argument or discussion as to the reason for recognition of ethnicity, if they could see the emotion from the Traveller groups last night in the Gallery, the standing ovation they got from Members of Dáil Éireann, the tears that were shed and the hugs and embraces that were engaged in - it was quite remarkable. Sometimes in this House we might lose faith in politics. I know that the Traveller groups had their faith in the political system sorely tested over the past number of years. They have experienced tragedies, as we all know. I am of the view that yesterday was a start of a new engagement and provides a positive platform to engage on a number of issues over the coming years. I want to put on the record of the House my congratulations to the Government, to the Taoiseach - who spoke so beautifully, including a phrase in Cant - but particularly to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. When someone does the work and makes the difference, he or she is to be commended and I want to do that today.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support what has been said about Bus Éireann. Across this House, we have been raising this issue and the issue of Dublin Bus for a number of months. SIPTU has announced that it is balloting its members in Dublin Bus and Irish Rail. The Minister has known this was coming from the first day of his appointment, it cannot be a surprise to him.From what was said on the radio this morning, I am quite sure the Minister is delighted with the fact that there is widespread support for his interest in changing the judicial appointments process. That is all very well and good but that is not his job. His job is to be the Minister for transport. The Independent Alliance now seems to be running around the place and getting very excited about the latest controversy with An Garda Síochána. At the same time, its senior Minister, who presents himself as the leader of the Independent Alliance group, is responsible for the transport policy of this country. On the day of his appointment, he knew there was impending industrial unrest in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. As someone with the responsibility for the purse strings of the Department, he has an opportunity to set out a three to five-year strategy for transport policy in this country. Senator Nash and I made this point as part of a Labour Party motion some months ago. There is deafening silence from the Minister unless he wants to post a selfie of himself going to work at 10 a.m. on a bus that, according to him, bizarrely seemed to be somewhat lacking in passengers. Most people who go to work at 10 a.m. on a weekday would probably find the bus slightly less packed than the good Minister, Deputy Ross. Not to get personal about it - having just got personal about it - but people have to take responsibility for the jobs they hold. This is the same Minister who has written scurrilous article after scurrilous article in the Sunday Independent when he had the opportunity to write them, saying very personal things about the trade union leadership and now he has the responsibility as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Trade to set out a vision for public transport in this country and he has failed in the most categorical way possible to do so. I join with others in this House in respectfully asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to possibly stop taking selfies in the bus, worrying about issues in the Department of Justice and Equality, to take responsibility for his own job in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and to come into this august Chamber and discuss with us how he sees the coming weeks and months progressing. One could ask what will happen in a couple of weeks' time if we have a Dublin Bus strike or a rail strike or the school buses do not run. Will he come in at that stage and admit that perhaps it is part of his portfolio? I respectfully support the contentions made by my colleagues across the House on this matter.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is unfair.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It will not be solved by the Sunday Independent either.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«And the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will he not come in before it is resolved? Is the Leader genuinely serious?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is unbelievable.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is absolutely unbelievable.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sorry, a Chathaoirligh. It is unbelievable.The Leader is telling the House that he will not bring in the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport until this strike is resolved.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He did. That is exactly what the Leader said.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is exactly what the Leader said. When that is resolved, he would bring in the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is unbelievable. What is the Leader waiting for?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is the Leader waiting for a Dublin Bus strike or an Irish Rail strike? Is he waiting for a school bus strike?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unbelievable.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be privatised if it was not for Deputy Kelly.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am responding to what the Leader actually said.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Would the Leader like me to ask if the record could be read back?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Or judicial appointments.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is a humdinger.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Surprisingly. I have reached 45,000 followers. The Taoiseach is absolutely brilliant. Up the Dubs.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate Senators Ruane and Warfield on putting the proposition to the House. While I agree with Senator Richmond that it is important to try to convince people who are not of the same point of view as oneself, people are seeing a window into what it was like being in government with Fine Gael for five years in terms of trying to get any progressive change over the line. The marriage equality proposition was roundly celebrated, and some of those involved are still doing laps of honour around the country. It was something Fine Gael did not want and kicked into the Constitutional Convention in order to-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was not until the Constitutional Convention came to the conclusion that we should have a referendum that Fine Gael agreed that should happen. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act almost collapsed the Government, if memory serves. It is, therefore, of no surprise to me or members of my party that a very progressive and innovative change to the voting law proposed by Senators Warfield and Ruane would be objected to by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. I am wondering of what they are afraid. Are they afraid of young people?  Imagine the dynamic in a local or European election when a candidate knocks on a door and a young person wearing a school uniform answers it. For the first time, the candidate will not ask if the person's mammy is in because he or she would have to listen to somebody who is in school and possibly going through all of the horrendous things that Senator Mulherin related. How are we supposed to learn about the lives of 16 or 17 year olds if we do not have to act on their opinions? Would it not be fantastically engaging to have a line of local election candidates in a secondary school or a youth club answering questions from young people as to what they are going to do with the property tax and what services would be improved?  I hate to tell the House this, but I am a guy with a mortgage and when one has a mortgage one gets a bit weird and begins to worry about stuff that will happen in one's area. One becomes a little bit more conservative when it comes to halting sites, injecting and drug treatment centres and social housing. Would not it be wonderful if a generation of young people without mortgages could stand up for decency, equality, public services and the things in which they fundamentally believe before they are beaten into the ground by our obsession with living in a capitalist society that chains them to mortgages and holding onto their castles for the rest of their lives? I spent 11 years as a teacher and learned more from the children I taught than I ever taught them. I am fully behind this suggestion. I remind everybody in the Chamber that when the Constitutional Convention decided, in its wisdom, that we should do such radical things as removing suggestions that women belong in the home from the Constitution and one should have the right to marry the person one loves, it was also asked whether it wanted to reduce the voting age to 17 years of age. It said "No" and instead recommended that it should be reduced to 16 years of age. We do not need a referendum to do what Senators Warfield and Ruane are suggesting. What is actually needed is legislation. Everybody has spoken about the Scottish experience when it held a referendum on independence and the number of young people who finally engaged in the democratic process. I believe in the idealism of youth. It would be wonderful to allow younger people to vote. When people turn 18, they have their first chance to vote and are more likely to be disconnected from their home because they may in college and are living away from home. If the buses are on strike because the Minister concerned does not want to know about it, young people will find it difficult to travel back to where they are from in order to cast their votes. If young people were still living in the area where they could vote for the first time that would provide a fantastic opportunity for local politics and councils to engage. They are very much part of the lives of young people, in terms of local facilities and infrastructure. I am not surprised by the opposition of Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil to the proposal, rather I am disappointed. In fairness, they have said they are willing to work in order to make this a reality but, to be honest, if they fundamentally believed in it and young people, they would back the proposal.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a well-intentioned and important Bill, which would allow 16 and 17 year olds to ask their Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil candidate at local elections what they actually believe in and other pertinent questions. I remember having a Dáil debate in my school which was attended by all the candidates, and it was fantastic. All the young people in my school asked questions. The most interesting one came from a little girl, who asked the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael candidates what was the difference between them.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Another day and another call for something to be done on the Bus Éireann strike. Yesterday I spent an hour with four bus drivers who were very pessimistic. They are very worried about the future of their company and very upset about its mismanagement over a number of years. They spoke about the fact that senior management of the company changed recently. They also spoke about the background of those now overseeing the company. For all the faults of the previous management, the new management does not have the same interest in engaging with trade union leaders. They are worried about their jobs and about the future of public service transport in this country. The point made to me was that it is time for the NTA to get involved. We are at the stage where the script is written for us to come to the House and ask the Minister to do something, to come to the House or to intervene in some way. He will not do it. He appears to have no interest in coming to the House or any House to address the fact no Bus Éireann buses are running at present. This is not a one-day strike here or a two-day strike there. It is an all-out strike. As I stated on Tuesday, this could spread to Dublin Bus, the other CIE companies and the school bus service. It is time for the NTA to get involved because it sets the context for public transport in this country. It oversees the entire CIE system and private operators. If the Minister will not do it, surely there is a role for the NTA to get involved. This is far too serious for it to be allowed to continue as is. I am as guilty as anybody else in the House of personalising issues too much, but in this regard it is quite clear the Minister involved has a responsibility to those who use the service and who believe in public transport. I live in a part of the country which is not served by Bus Éireann with regard to day-to-day use of a bus service so I can speak with a level of independence on the issue. A number of bus drivers were outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday and I thought security was a bit over the top. I do not know why the barriers were put up in such an over the top manner but I will leave that where it is. When will the political system react to this situation? The company will die if something does not happen. Are we trying to starve the drivers back to work? They will not go. The four gentlemen I met yesterday I am quite sure reflect the entirety of the Bus Éireann workforce. They are not going back to work in the current situation. This has gone beyond one-liners and personality-based politics and I plead with the Leader to make representations to the Minister, Deputy Ross, to come to the House and address the situation, and we can toss over ideas about how we can resolve this issue. In all fairness to everybody in the House, none of us wants to oversee a situation where next we have Dublin Bus out, then the trains out and then school buses not running and we all knew it was coming. I beg of the Leader to make representations to the Minister, Deputy Ross, in all fairness and in good faith to address the House on this issue. I second Senator O'Sullivan's amendment to the Order of Business.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Somebody must have thought Senator Norris was a farmer.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I read them. They are hilarious.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The advertisements mention road frontage.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I hope my comment does not get coverage.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As well.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House. As other speakers have said, this is a very welcome development and the Minister and his team are to be congratulated on it. I join others in asking the Minister to comment on the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I understand, having spent some time in the Department of Justice and Equality, that it is not an easy process. The way that the Government addresses such issues is to put all of the legislation in place first and then to ratify the convention. I ask the Minister to comment on that, given the day that is in it. Fine Gael and the Labour Party worked very well together in government on certain issues, including in the health sphere, where we managed to introduce free GP care for every child under six. It is disappointing that this was not rolled out for a wider age cohort. Given that this is a welcome move that benefits children with a disability, I ask the Minister to comment on the Government's plan to roll out free GP care to a wider age group. I congratulate the Minister and his Department on a job well done with this legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I very much appreciate the Minister being here in person to address this issue. He will be well aware of the geographical area related to this issue as it is in his constituency. I was involved in a campaign to establish an Educate Together school in the Drumcondra area, and one of the first actions the Minister took on taking office was to sanction the approval of that Educate Together primary school in Dublin 3 in the Marino-Drumcondra area. The campaign to establish that school was elongated and it took a long time to get it off the ground but it was successful. There are some long-established Educate Together schools in the more northern end of the constituency, which the Minister knows very well, in an area where a major degree of construction is taking place and where there has been major growth in the population. The people in that area will need a number of facilities, including school facilities. In terms of Educate Together schooling, in line with the vision of the previous Government and, I hope, with that of the Minister, he will be familiar with the Educate Together schools in Kilbarrack and in Belmayne. We are asking that there would be a logical continuum of that ethos of education for the children who attend those schools. There has been a metamorphosis in the ethos of one second level school, Clonturk community college, into a new type of school with joint patronage. What we hope to achieve in Dublin 13, which covers a number of areas, including Clongriffin, Belmayne, Donaghmede, Baldoyle and Sutton, is that a new Educate Together would be established to facilitate those children, living in the area of rapid population, who attend an Educate Together school to have a continuum of that ethos of education, which is available to every other schoolchild attending other schools in the area. No other children in that area attending another school is asked to change the ethos of his or her schooling when he or she moves from primary to second level. If a child attends a Gaelscoil, there is a facility for him or her to attend a second level Gaelscoil. If a child attends a Catholic ethos school, he or she can continue that ethos at second level. That is not available to children who attend an Educate Together primary school.  While it is appreciated that the Department of Education and Skills has made great strides in recent years in increasing the number of Educate Together schools that are available for parents who want that ethos for their children's education, it does not make any sense for that to stop once a child reaches sixth class. While the growth in this type of education is greatly appreciated, the parents and members of the committee involved, some of whom are in the Public Gallery, want to know what process they can pursue and how they can work with Government and the Department to make this a reality. This campaign does not necessarily need to be fractious or full of tension or friction. We want to achieve the establishment of an educational institution that the children can have to continue their education in the ethos chosen - as is a constitutional right - by their parents. I ask the Minister to outline where those involved in the campaign are to go next. These children attend an Educate Together school at primary level, or some of them do not. They live in an area that is under major development. They need a process whereby they can work with the Minister and his Department to arrive at a stage where they will be able to have a new education facility available to them. Nobody can convince me, and I am sure the Minister would agree with me, that this area will not need extra school places in the years to come. What we want is fair play. There have been moves across the city and the country with respect to the opening up of second level education. Often it is easier to open up a primary school rather than a second level school, but in areas of north County Dublin there are various different models, including community school models. I am mindful of the Malahide area where the Educate Together model has been approved by the Department because it is seen as providing a continuum of education which is necessary for the children concerned.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I respectfully ask the Minister for a positive response to this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his response. The Minister is very familiar with the area. It does not take too much effort to appreciate that population pressure is only a number of years away given the incredible intensity of building work and apartment building in the area. Could the Minister at least commit that he or his Department officials will work with the campaigning group, which is open to all sorts of options, including a similar type of arrangement to that in Clonturk, in order to facilitate children to have a continuum of education? I do not think the Malahide and Portmarnock option will fly when one has such a large geographical area that is in need of this facility and considering that the vast majority of those places will be taken up by people living in the area. I say that with the greatest respect to the Minister. I appreciate him being here in person and his comprehensive reply. I also appreciate the constraints under which he is operating as Minister.Could the Minister give a commitment that his officials will sit down with the campaigning group and outline how best this campaign can proceed, what type of information it needs, what type of population figures will help the case and give realistic projections of what the population growth will be? As the Minister knows, it is only a matter of time until-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----there is a campaign for second level schools to facilitate the population numbers.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In this House we are well used to hearing congratulatory statements from all quarters about the achievements of our sporting sides who wear the green. I am a particular fan of ladies football, soccer, Gaelic and rugby. I spend a good bit of my time supporting my local team, Shelbourne Ladies FC, which tends to win various domestic titles, as well as in its previous guise as Raheny United. What happened this morning at a press conference in Liberty Hall should appal every sports fan in this country. It is not just an issue of gender equality; it is more an issue of workers' rights and representative rights than anything else. Effectively, the entire Irish senior women's soccer team was forced into a situation where the players had to hold a press conference at 10.30 a.m. at Liberty Hall to demand action on their rights as individuals. They are simply demanding they should have representative rights from the Professional Footballers Association of Ireland, which League of Ireland players have and which the senior men's team have but the FAI is not allowing this.  Some of the instances they outlined today were quite simply appalling. These are people who wear the green of this country in stadiums all over the world. They are not even allowed to have their own tracksuits. They have to share the tracksuits with the under-19s so they have to assemble at Dublin Airport to go abroad to play for their country and they have to change into their tracksuits in the public toilets. This is unbelievable.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister come in here and address this issue. In fairness to him, he is somebody who has spoken out of the need for gender equality on sporting boards. He is somebody who has a very deep interest in gender equality. This is not just a case of gender equality; this is about representation of a bunch of elite sportspeople who want to represent their country and are out of pocket because in Ireland, a person who is not a professional footballer because he or she plays in the domestic league here will lose a day's pay by going to play for his or her country. It is unbelievable that after many years of having behind-the-scenes grumbling about the situation, they were obliged to come together this morning in Liberty Hall to speak about their grievances. If we in this House are serious about congratulating our Irish men and women who go across the world and wear the green with pride, we should all collectively be embarrassed that an Irish team would have to change in the public toilets of Dublin Airport to get into tracksuits which are not even their own.I ask respectfully if we could ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come into the House because we give these people money. It is State funding - taxpayers' money - that funds the FAI and if it is not going to properly look after elite sports people in that organisation, then we have to seriously reassess our relationship with that body. I am appalled and I ask that the Leader facilitates that debate. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Like Senator Ruane, I find it difficult not to be emotional while speaking on this Bill in this Chamber along with Senator Ruane, Senator Kelleher, who has worked in the homeless services in Cork, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who has been so supportive of this legislation. We have people from the Ana Liffey trust in the Visitors Gallery, including Marcus Keane and Tony Duffin, who have spearheaded the campaign for this legislation for quite a long time. I had the Minister of State's role in the previous Government, as she knows. When I first came across the Ana Liffey project and listened to the humanity of what they were trying to achieve, it was very difficult to find any logical reason this city and country would not pursue what other cities and countries have pursued. This is not, as others have said, a pioneering facility and, in fact, there are 88 such facilities across Europe, as well as one in Sydney and others in North America. The fundamental point is that these facilities will save lives. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe. We have people today injecting in alleys in the open air, which is extremely dangerous. They are liable to contract any type of blood-borne disease, such as hepatitis C or HIV, but they are also likely to die. This reality was brought home to me during the 1916 commemorations when there were two deaths of young men in Dublin city centre within a stone's throw of the GPO, one, ironically enough, in the toilets of Connolly Station, where a young man overdosed and died, and another young man overdosed and remained for two nights in Foley Street in the north inner city. It did not make the news at all.Nobody noticed because nobody cared because, on some level, Irish society has decided it is their own fault. We have a mentality of victim-blaming when it comes to heroin overdose or heroin use. The different types of media reporting is remarkable; if a student dies as a result of taking a pill in a nightclub, all the commentary will be about the future that young person could have had and why politicians are not doing more. However, if someone dies of an overdose in a toilet in Dublin or in Cork, there will not be one column inch or one report about it. There are some journalists who need to be congratulated for the way they have supported this Bill - Stuart Clarke from Hot Press and Cormac O'Keeffe from the Irish Examiner were both very supportive of this initiative. However, there have been others in the Irish media who continually dehumanise and degrade those in addiction, using terminology which dehumanises them and undermines them. They perpetuate this problem and they will misrepresent what we are trying to do in this Chamber.  I want to congratulate people from the Minister of State's own party, including Deputies Paschal Donohoe, Leo Varadkar and Frances Fitzgerald, who backed this idea from the beginning. I also congratulate people from my own party such as Deputy Joan Burton, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien from Sinn Féin who was very supportive of this from the very beginning, Independent Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, and Deputy Jack Chambers from Fianna Fáil, who made a submission in support to the national drugs strategy. This initiative will save lives. On that basis I do not see how anybody can logically have any issue with it. Obviously the regulations will have to be investigated carefully. For many people it is a jump into a radical new way of thinking when it comes to drug policy. However, I would ask anyone who has a question about this if it was their brother or sister - because it is someone's brother or sister - or if it was their father, mother or child, where would they want them to inject if they were sucked into hopeless addiction. Would it be behind a skip or in a toilet, or in a facility which is surrounded by services in a compassionate and safer manner? That is the question. Nobody has ever died in an injecting centre anywhere in the world. It is the first step on the road to recovery. This will fail if all we give people is a room to inject. It has to be a suite of services so people will be able to take that first step on the road to recovery. It is remarkable that no matter where I go, people quietly approach me. They tip me on the shoulder and thank me for what I have done on injecting centres, saying their son or their brother had died of an overdose, but they are ashamed to say it. If this was any other health issue we would have a packed Gallery here, there would be a rally outside because people want to give voice to the fact that people are literally dying on the streets. However, they do not do it over heroin overdoses because we have continually managed to dehumanise this debate and blame the victim.  I congratulate the Minister of State for taking this on and internalising it and driving it forward. I am so proud to stand here with other people in this Chamber who are making this happen. There are other parts of the country crying out for a centre of this nature but this is a good, decent thing we are doing today. Sometimes it is not easy in politics to stand up for the person who is most vulnerable, who will be demonised and dehumanised in Irish media and often in politics as well. Today politics is actually standing up for that individual. Lives will be saved and the Minister of State is to be commended for that. I cannot wait until this legislation is passed and we can have a centre that is open and we realise that all of us collectively were right in pursuing that, and I am sure that it will be the first of many. I congratulate the Minister of State and support her 100% in the passage of this Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will raise two issues, the first of which is child poverty. There have been a number of requests made this morning and I agree that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be invited to come to the House to discuss the issue of mother and baby homes. In the past few weeks I have found the noise in the Houses on the issue of water charges distressing. One sees images of Deputies and Senators with scraps of paper surrounded by other parliamentary colleagues and there have been discussions of the threat of an election and the possibility that the issue will cause the collapse of the Government. An incredible amount of energy has gone into discussing the issue. It would be refreshing if the issue of child poverty created the same amount of heat, excitement and enthusiasm in all political parties represented in the House. It would be refreshing to witness a politician in the Houses with a scrap of paper discussing how the issue of child poverty could be adequately addressed and tackled and to have those surrounding that individual saying it is something on which we could go to the country. It is of fundamental importance to the survival of the Republic. Anybody who believes in the real meaning of the word "republic" would take the issue of child poverty that seriously. However, the issue which generates that effect is water charges. It is the issue that has got people excited. On the issue of child poverty, I want to make a practical suggestion that the Minister be invited to come to the House to discuss her vision for the ongoing area-based childhood, ABC, programme which encompasses a number of initiatives, including in my constituency the preparing for life scheme in Darndale. There are 15 such schemes across the country. I would like to have the Minister's input on how she believes the schemes that tackle child poverty and empower parents can be enhanced in the coming years. Like other Senators, I raise the issue of Chechnya and LGBT rights. This was the first country in the world to openly vote in favour of marriage equality. We have a number of things of which we can be proud in this country in promoting LGBT rights across the political spectrum. Most recently, my colleague, Senator Gerald Nash, has been attempting to push that agenda further in this Chamber. We are a beacon of light for the world when it comes to LGBT rights. It is important when the Vice President of America wants to roll back on LGBT rights that we stand firmly in opposition. In Chechnya there are reports that camps and detention centres are being established and that young LGBT males, in particular, are being rounded up and sent to them. It is important we take a stand against this. I respectfully ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be asked to come to the Chamber to discuss the issue in order that we can have a proper conversation with him about how he can discuss the issue with the Russian ambassador to this country because we are a beacon of light when it comes to dealing with certain issues. This is a country which has a proud recent record of promoting LGBT rights. It is something on which we should not be behind the door when speaking about how we can play our role in the international fight for LGBT equality.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Mullen walks on water.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party and I support the Bill, but before our friends in the Gallery from the vintners association get too excited I wish to state on the record I am not a fan of that association or what it does. Its influence over Irish politics is far too powerful, and its opposition to the injecting centre proposal is at best misguided and at worst miserable. We have an obsession with alcohol in this country which is dysfunctional. It is the cause of a high percentage of domestic abuse, sexual assault and rape cases. Two people a week in Ireland die from fatal overdoses of alcohol. These are not people who get so drunk they fall in front of a car, these are people who drink so much that they die. It costs the HSE approximately €3 billion every year and if one goes to an average accident and emergency department any night of the week one realises why this is so. I wince when I hear politicians speak about the pub being the centre or focal point of a community. If this is the case we have gone seriously wrong. I remind people that the GAA, when it was established in 1884, was as much an institution to tackle the abuse of alcohol among young people as it was to re-engage people with the national sports. I will put my cards on the table. I have a vested interest as I drink and I partake in a pint or two. However, I am also a republican and on this basis I inform the House that as someone who has been a public servant and paid from the public purse since March 2000, as a teacher, a principal of a school, a Deputy, a Minister of State and a Senator, in all that time I have started my working day with a Christian prayer. In every place I have worked, in my school, in the Dáil and now in the Seanad, as a public servant every single day my working day has begun with a Christian prayer. I am paid from the public purse now, as I was when I was a teacher. I absolutely believe in the separation of church and state. This is why I and my party support the contention that if people do not want to drink on Good Friday it is absolutely their religious right not to partake in alcohol on Good Friday.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«People in my family feel very strongly about what they consume with regard to food on Good Friday and Ash Wednesday. It is something they do because of their strong religious beliefs. I will not belittle anybody. In fact, I was very impressed by Senator Joe O'Reilly's speech. Despite the fact he was interrupted by number of people in the Chamber, I am quite impressed that somebody would stand against the grain and make the case for the retention of the law as it is, although I do not agree with his reasons. As somebody who fundamentally believes in the separation of church and state, this is not the big issue. Our churches still have a huge influence over our hospitals, health system and education system, and there are bigger issues that need to be contended with. I must accept the issues raised by my colleagues in Sinn Féin on workers' rights, and agree with the representatives from the trade unions who have also made these cases. It is a low-paid industry where people generally start on very low pay, and it is a vulnerable type of work. By its very nature, the individuals employed in the industry deal with people who have had too much to drink. It is something of which we must be mindful. In this regard I am thankful we did not ram through the legislation in one day and we are taking the time to consider it more fully. I will summarise my few points. Our national obsession with alcohol is dysfunctional and literally killing us. It is supported by a very powerful lobby group, whose influence on Irish legislation is something that must be tackled. I make reference again to its objections to the injecting centres. It is remarkable how it feels the drug it pedals is somehow more socially acceptable than what we are trying to control in injecting centres. Fundamentally, as somebody who believes in the separation of church and state, on this basis if someone wants to go down to a pub on Good Friday and have a pint in good conscience who are we to stop him or her from doing this? I believe the original legislation was enacted in 1927 and it also included St. Patrick's Day. Since that was overturned 50 years ago, nobody has suggested we should return to having pubs closed on St. Patrick's Day. Let us be honest, what goes on on Good Friday shows exactly what type of a dysfunctional relationship we have with alcohol. There are lines of people outside off-licences on Holy Thursday, people trying to get into train stations to go on imaginary train journeys and people going on barges on the canal. I heard a story last Good Friday of a friend of mine on a barge on the canal, who shared the barge with several friends and an English hen party who were so confused as they could not find a drink in Dublin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not in any way diminish the issues we have with alcohol in this country, which are killing us. On the republican basis of separation of church and state, this is something we must support.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is about choice on Good Friday.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Except the gays.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I second that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to put on record what a wonderful moment it is in our Oireachtas to finally pass this Bill. I acknowledge the members of the Ana Liffey Drug Project who are in the Visitors Gallery. They have been working over a number of years to make this day a reality. I thank the Minister of State for taking this on and for bringing it to today's point at which it will finally pass and become law. Notwithstanding the comments of my colleague from Fianna Fáil, this has had pretty much universal political support across the spectrum in both Houses. Perhaps we are maturing as a country in terms of drug law. Senator Lynn Ruane and I are moving a Bill on 31 May that will hopefully once again achieve wide-ranging political support to take the next step in the decriminalisation of the drug user. I want to put on record the name of a man called Robert Keyes, who died on 8 November 2015 in St. Audeon's Park in Dublin of a fatal overdose. When the person who came across his body telephoned the emergency services, the person said that it was "just another junkie". This man's mother came forward recently and spoke about her son lovingly and caringly in the media and said that nobody is a "junkie" in this country. What the Minister of State is doing today is ensuring through this life-saving measure that we bring humanity back into our drug policy and that we finally move beyond the situation in which anybody would decide to dehumanise or denigrate another person with that disgusting term. Every citizen of this State is entitled to humane and compassionate treatment. If somebody is hopelessly crippled with an addiction, he or she deserves the care and compassion of this State. This injecting centre legislation provides this in order that nobody else has to go to a park, behind a skip, into an alleyway or into a playground to inject themselves in such a harmful manner. We will establish a facility that will ensure people's lives can be saved, that they will not contract hepatitis C or HIV and that we can look on these individuals as people with names. Perhaps it is time for a names project such as the one in the United States for people with AIDS. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe. Perhaps people who are affected by this or whose families are affected such as the people who approach me and say their son or brother died of an overdose but will not say so publicly can begin to speak their names in a loving way because they are or were not junkies. They are human beings afflicted by addiction. This is the first step along the road towards a proper way to tackle this issue in a humane and compassionate way. I congratulate the Minister of State on taking it on, dealing with it with such humanity and dignity and seeing it through to this day. We speak in an empty Chamber, but that does not mean that what we are doing is not absolutely historic and will not save lives.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House. It is great to have him here in his current capacity. Given what his next capacity might be, it is good to have an opportunity to air our opinions with him. I acknowledge the presence of various campaigners, including representatives of Transgender Equality Network Ireland, in the Gallery. It was interesting to listen to the comments of Senator Butler earlier in this debate. When I was a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection in the last Oireachtas, we were not expecting to be asked to deal with gender recognition legislation. One would imagine that such a Bill would be an equality measure, but it turns out that it is a social protection measure. I think it would be reasonable to suggest that the officials with whom the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, and the then Minister of State, Senator Kevin Humphreys, worked on that Bill were not used to working in this sphere on an equality measure that would benefit the lives of so many people in Ireland. At the time, a number of members of the joint committee scratched their heads and asked why they were dealing with this matter. It was a social protection measure because it was about registering one's identity. It was fascinating to watch the process evolve during that period. Senator Butler might have admitted that he was one of the many people who came from a certain perspective on this issue because they were not used to dealing with it. Indeed, they did not even have the language to deal with it. Much of the language that one must get used to using in this whole area is very sensitive. One can offend somebody gratuitously without realising it. During the period in question, we watched people from different political perspectives come to the conclusion that it was a good and ground-breaking Bill. I think it was one of the first Bills of this kind to be introduced by any government across Europe. Although we realised that it should probably go further, we went with it and it was passed. We felt at the time that it was a good day's work. I want to join others in congratulating Senators Warfield and Norris for bringing this Bill before the House. I genuinely think Senator Warfield's speech, in which he set out what this is really all about, will go down in the annals of the history of standing up for LGBT rights in these Houses over the ages. The Labour Party absolutely supports this Bill. Rather than going over the issues that have already been raised, I would like to take a moment to reflect on how far we have come. Twenty years ago, it would have been almost impossible to imagine that a conversation like this would happen in a political sense, that there would be very little political opposition to this type of measure and, with the best will in the world, that we would all want this type of legislation and the changes in it to be supported. I would like to raise a few issues with the Minister while he is here, in the first instance by picking up on a point made by Senator Buttimer. While I understand the need for somebody to have recognition of their true identity, I sometimes wonder why we make it even more difficult for people in this situation by having such a gender-conscious society. For example, why are we still obsessed with having boys' and girls' schools? I mention education because it is very much a State-run institution. Maybe we should have a longer conversation on why it is so important to separate children and young people on the basis of gender. It should not be important. In fact, it leads to gender stereotypes. There is no real reason behind it. There is no educational reason behind it. I know that is another discussion for another day, but having to participate in such a gender-orientated education system does not make it easier for a young trans person trying to live in Irish society. I would like to refer to an issue that I have brought to the Minister's attention previously. I know he is aware of it, but I will raise it again. A young trans man, Noah Halpin, has come to my attention. I am working with this gentleman. He is finding it easier to get gender recognition of himself as a trans man than to get his name changed. It is frustrating for him that he has spent two years waiting for his name to be formally recognised as Noah as opposed to the name he was given as a child. It is particularly difficult for him to go through the process of constantly having to revert to his given name. While we may achieve things in legislation that can make it easier for somebody to change their gender identity in a formal sense, we do not allow them the same ease of transition in changing their names. I think this is something that genuinely needs to be addressed.I will finish my comments because everything I wanted to say has already been said.  We have made significant advances in this sphere, and Senator Buttimer referred to this. Over the past number of years, the Employment Equality Act has changed the chilling effect for LGBT teachers. In the education sphere we have had the compulsory anti-transphobic and anti-homophobic bullying legislation and the Gender Recognition Act which Senator Humphreys drove through the Oireachtas. The Child and Family Relationships Act has been passed and we have marriage equality.  Sometimes, there is sense that as the focus of public debate moves on to another area, we can become complacent about where we are with LGBT rights and assume that these rights will always be with us and will always be enhanced. It is only when Senators like Senator Warfield stand up and point at the deficiencies in the Bill that we can come back together again. We can never take for granted the rights that have been hard-won by people like Senator Norris. We need to consider what is happening in the United States, and the mentality of the Vice President, Mike Pence, who is a powerful man in America. The situation in Chechnya was mentioned. The meeting with the Russian ambassador today was, I am led to believe, pretty pointless because he had a total disregard for what Senator Buttimer said.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am quite sure he was on the receiving end of some very tough talk. The point is that we always assume we are getting more progressive, things will always get better, we will always be more progressive and enlightened and that legislation will always become more liberal. That is not always the case. We have to be very mindful of that. I again congratulate Senator Humphreys and Deputy Joan Burton for driving this issue through the last Dáil.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the members of the committee who were willing to have their perspectives on this changed and go with the Bill as it was. I thank Members of the House who were open-minded enough to meet the representatives and organisations and support the Bill. None of us can in any way be complacent about this agenda - I know Senator Warfield is not. While we congratulate ourselves on how far we have come in such a short space of time, we need to look around the world and realise that while we may perhaps be a guiding light now, there will always be forces trying to bring us back. I again thank Senators Warfield and Norris and the Minister. I wish to repeat that there is a difficulty with changing one's name officially. Our obsession with gender-based education has to be challenged.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to the House to discuss an important concern which he shares with me. Many public representatives are concerned we are living in a city full of what are in effect tinder boxes and that fire regulations need to be strengthened or reflected upon. The fire safety of buildings constructed in the past 20 years is raising much concern for residents and their representatives. There is a particular difficulty in that when questions are raised about the fire safety of houses or an apartment block in an individual estate, there is a reluctance among residents to use the normal engagement process with their public representatives, with councils or with the media because they are terrified the value of their properties will collapse. They are stuck in a bind of wanting to do something about the fire safety concerns around the places in which they live. They are also worried that the obvious resolution mechanisms they would normally go through are closed off from them because they do not want hurt the value of their properties. This is completely understandable. We are coming to the conclusion that we need a dedicated agency where people can make confidential reports about fire safety concerns. In turn, these can be dealt with on a confidential basis to bypass this issue about the value of properties being undermined. In many of these cases, the issues can be rectified without any reputational damage to the properties in question as well as the significant investment people have made in them. The last thing we need is where people make a determination about the value of their property versus the value of their lives and those of their families, taking a risk their home will never go on fire. We cannot have them deciding that, because the mortgage on the property is so huge and debilitating to their quality of life, they take a risk on the property’s fire safety. This is an issue that has been going during the lifetime of for several Governments. The former Minister with responsibility for the environment commissioned a report after five houses in the Millfield Manor estate in Newbridge, County Kildare, were completely destroyed by fire in less than half an hour.I understand that this report has been completed and that the current Minister is in possession of it. I am anxious to know what the report contains. This matter relates to the overall general standard of fire safety throughout the country. Fire safety is the responsibility of the local authorities but the level of resources varies from council to council. The responses of councils also vary. It is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to oversee this issue and ensure that there is a mechanism in place whereby people can raise their concerns and by means of which we can conduct an effective audit of all construction carried out in the past 20 years when regulations were not as tightly controlled in respect of dwellings where people's lives are at risk. We all know of individual apartment blocks in our localities and constituencies that are fire hazards. The risks exist but the residents are terrified of raising concerns about them lest the value of their properties collapses. I appreciate the Leas-Chathaoirleach's patience in allowing me to put my point of view. This is a serious issue and I know the Minister of State will appreciate that. I look forward to his response.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have with me a response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Clare Daly on 22 June 2016. It is disappointing that the Minister of State's response is effectively a cut-and-paste job from that. In fact, I was flicking through it and I could read, word for word and sentence for sentence, the reply given by the Department to the Minister of State to be read in the Seanad today. It is exactly the same as the reply in June 2016, almost one year ago. Without any disrespect to the Minister of State, it appears that the Department has not moved on very much in a year, particularly in view of the fact that it has provided - word for word - the same response. What we are discussing here is lives that are at risk in apartment blocks and estates across the city and the country. We are also discussing the capacity of individuals or groups of individuals, residents associations or public representatives to make representations to the Government about the nature of the risk that exists.We need a confidential facility for any person or group of individuals to make a complaint about a concern they have, which they will not make lightly. It is not a light thing for anyone to say they think there is a fire safety issue in his or her block of apartments or in his or her estate. The person would make this confidential request to the Department which would then conduct an audit. However, a more robust audit has to be carried out nationally and must not be dependent on councils. Either that or we must demand that councils conduct these audits because otherwise cases will continue to arise throughout the country. It will take until the fire actually happens because although residents are concerned by fire safety, they are restricted by their concern for the value of their properties and worry over reputational damage. I am not trying to have a political go on the response given to me. I understand what happens here, that cut-and-paste jobs are done all the time for ministerial responses, but we cannot wait for another estate or apartment block to go on fire. A proactive response is needed. The councils are not doing it and we must ensure they do it and that have a confidential information line that groups and residents can use to have their fire safety complaints rectified.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Go raibh maith agat. I seek leave to amend the Order of Business to table the Order for Second Stage for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017. I raise with the Leader the issue of the ongoing Garda controversy and question marks over the tenure of the Garda Commissioner, senior Garda management and the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality. To bring it down to street level, while great emphasis has been put on this controversy, the Garda is dealing with ongoing community issues daily. In fairness to the Taoiseach, when the north inner city was in the media spotlight for violent crime, he made a significant commitment to engaging with the community and established a commission to report on the situation. The Taoiseach was very well received, as was the commission report by Mr. Kieran Mulvey. I ask the Leader to update Members on that report. These issues have faded from the public eye but people still live in these communities. I was a school principal in that area and taught in that community for 11 years. It should not take a killing, a feud or criminal activity for us to notice what is happening in the north inner city. It is a vibrant community. A lot is going on there but the implementation of this report will be very important. While the headlines and the political comings and goings around the Garda Commissioner and other Garda issues in the public domain are very important, gardaí on the ground are doing their best to police a vibrant community in an area which faces major challenges. The commission report needs to be implemented. The chairmanship of that report is I believe still to be determined.  May I pay a tribute to the Taoiseach? The Taoiseach visited my local GAA club, Scoil Uí Chonaill GAA club on the Clontarf Road, which is attended by a significant number of children from the north inner city. He was incredibly well received and to be honest he really was very engaged with the children, the club members and what was happening in that club, which does a great deal of work. In fairness, nobody on our side of the House wishes to question his commitment to dealing with what was happening in the north inner city but at this juncture, it is important for us to see the implementation of the findings of that report. We cannot really wait for the next shooting, the next episode of gangland violence or the next headline before that debate happens in this House. It is at this stage, while we are in a period in which there is relative calm and people are getting on with their lives and want to go to the next level, that we should start talking the rebuilding of communities in that proud area.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They love bombing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to require certain employers to publish information relating to the pay of employees for the purpose of showing whether there are differences in the pay of male and female employees and, if so, the nature and scale of such differences; for that purpose to amend the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014; and to provide for related matters.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next Tuesday.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. The Immigrant Council of Ireland has welcomed the strategy but the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has effectively rejected it on the basis that it does not involve enough time-sensitive elements and needs to be more concrete in the context of what is trying to be achieved. I agree with what many other Senators said on integration and immigration issues. These are scary times. Notwithstanding what was said about Trump and Brexit, which was effectively an immigration debate, I am not necessarily as positive as Senator Lawless about recent elections in Europe. Basically, one third of the French electorate voted for a person who is a fascist and a racist. Up to 49% of the Austrian public almost elected a neo-Nazi as president. In fairness to Ireland, we have never had a mainstream political party adopt immigration as a platform at a general election. Minor parties have done so but have had little support at election time. No major political party has listed as a priority in its election manifesto anything about immigration, curbing immigration or any xenophobic platform. We need to be thankful for and recognise that. We should not be complacent, however. Notwithstanding what has been said, I was somewhat taken aback by self-congratulatory statements regarding the political reaction to what happened in Ballaghaderreen. I remember different things being said by political representatives there before the people made their decision as to how they felt about people coming to their villages. I recall political representatives from that area being a little bit less than welcoming. It was the people - the local shopkeepers and the community - who welcomed the Syrian refugees into their arms. Then the political system began chasing after the people. I found it quite discouraging but then encouraging. When I held the Minister of State's position, there was no issue that Senators raised more often than direct provision and no issue on which I worked harder. I would love to be the person to declare the end of direct provision. However, when we are dealing with it, we have to work beyond slogans and things that fit neatly into hashtags. Instead, we must deal with reality. We have the McMahon report on direct provision, which was a compromise between several NGOs that felt passionately about this matter and the Department. I was present when the report was launched in July 2015. The Minister for Justice and Equality said it was something to be considered and food for thought. The NGOs that signed off on the report did so at massive risk to their reputations. They are trying hard to improve the system. They thought, in good faith, that the departmental officials would implement the report word for word. It was not a discussion document because the NGOs compromised on issues in respect of which they did not want to compromise, namely, work, oversight and length of stay. When it was signed off, those NGOs felt they could stand over it if it was implemented to the letter. Almost two years on, this has not happened. This is classic Department of Justice and Equality behaviour. The phrase it always comes back to is "pull factor". It feels that if we show some humanity, we might get pull factor into this country, meaning there might be more of them and what would we do then. This issue should been resolved years ago before we had a housing crisis, an increasing number of asylum applications and before we agreed to take 4,000 Syrian programme refugees. In 2015, at the time of the publication of the report on direct provision, there were 2,695 people who had been in direct provision for over three years. The figure now is 1,200, which means there are 1,500 people fewer in the system than was the case two years ago. That has to be commended. However, how is an NGO going to trust the Department of Justice and Equality and compromise with it on an issue if this report is not implemented? I am blue in the face saying to the Minister of State that the draft programme for Government contained a commitment to implement the McMahon report. When the actual programme for Government emerged, that sentence had been deleted. I do not know who deleted it. It was not the Minister of State because he did not have this portfolio at the time. Somebody did, however, and I bet it was the Department. I know it has a history of being pretty miserable and unsympathetic when it comes to this entire area. I do not know if we can end direct provision. I do not want to put 4,500 people on a housing list. I do not want to be responsible for stories about vulnerable families being homeless and living in parks under trees. Those were the reports of what happened in 2000. I am not going with hashtags or slogans. However, for God's sake, can we not just implement this report to the letter? Another issue has been raised in the context of undocumented migrants. It is to the credit of Senator Lawless that he has been working for years to have the undocumented Irish in America regularised. It is to our shame, however, that our entire political system has the brass neck to arrive at the White House to tell the Americans to regularise the undocumented Irish when there are 26,000 undocumented workers here for whom we are not willing to do likewise.How do we have the gumption or the credibility to ask anybody in that white supremacist, racist regime to do something for the Irish when we will not do it here? We are talking about 26,000 individuals, comprising 20,000 workers and about 6,000 children. Those are the issues we need to recognise. There is immense goodwill in this country for people from overseas. It comes down to the very essence of who we are as a migrant people. We understand the Syrian situation because we are the people who travelled in coffin ships. We understand the dehumanising of people because of their religious beliefs because that is exactly what the Irish went through in America and in Britain. We understand the signs that said "No blacks, no dogs, no Irish". We understand that stuff instinctively, and that is why I believe no political party will ever go down this line. It would not be to the credit of the Minister of State's Department if this nonsense with the 26,000 undocumented workers were not addressed and if this report were not implemented to the letter. I do not believe the Department of Justice and Equality is fit to deal with this issue, because it has to deal with the issues of Garda reform, the prison service, the vast bulk of legislation that goes through these two Houses, all the equality issues and, on top of that, integration, immigration, refugee and asylum issues. This is a sensitive humanitarian issue and it should be put into a separate Department. I welcome the strategy, notwithstanding that Migrant Rights Centre Ireland has serious issues with it. I fundamentally believe we are political hypocrites if we end up in the White House again talking about undocumented workers in the US without doing something here. I am not asking the Minister of State to end direct provision, but the least we could do, for God's sake, is to implement the report that we commissioned in conjunction with the NGOs two years ago.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I had intended to raise a separate issue but most Members of the House would agree that everything is overshadowed by the events in Manchester. Like other Members I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to express the Seanad's condolences with the people of Britain, the Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, and the newly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. It is difficult to come to terms with what happened last night and to find an adequate response. Unfortunately, when something so hateful and evil occurs the response can often be one of hate. While there has been a massive outpouring of love and compassion among the ordinary, decent people of Manchester there were, unfortunately, sentiments of hate swirling around and trying to capitalise on this event to once again dehumanise and denigrate an entire faith and decent people living in Britain. It was the Irish who once bombed Manchester and people in this country stood with the people of Manchester at that time, so it is important to do so now in the face of this appalling tragedy. Anybody in this House or in Ireland who knows a young person who has ever attended a concert can only weep at the thought of the scenes that were witnessed by the young people. Those who have survived will have flashes of imagery going through their minds for the rest of their lives. It will not leave them, so how do we fight back as has been suggested? What we must have in our armoury, as Senator McDowell so eloquently put it, is information and knowledge, as well as compassion, love and a belief that in unity and understanding we can create a society that can overcome these things. Again, we stand in solidarity with the people of Manchester. We must not allow those of a certain political persuasion to use this event for their own narrow ends to denigrate an entire people or faith in the UK. There are also people in this jurisdiction who will use this for their own ends as well. We are better than that. We are a proud and decent people. It is only through compassion, love and understanding that this terrorism will be defeated.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Who is the new Minister for Justice?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is an open goal.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber. I am a huge believer in and defender of public service broadcasting, and in general I am supportive of what RTE does in that regard. I would be critical of it in my remarks purely because I have such high expectations for the standard of broadcasting RTE gives to this country. I agree with what Senator Dolan said about diversity because I want to speak to diversity in terms of RTE's programming. I believe RTE needs to take the gender equality issue more seriously.We must address the issue of all-male panels. It is sometimes very difficult to have a handle on how best to promote diversity among presenters of various shows, as the BBC has done. Panel presenters, who are the face of Ireland and RTE, are still predominantly white. This has to be addressed. While it may be challenging to address in terms of various ethnic backgrounds, it is not as challenging to address the gender issue. It is still really unacceptable that a number of panels, be it in political programming or sports programming, are so dominated by men. No matter what a programme is about, having six, seven or even more men discussing it just has to end. I have often been on panels and mentioned that it was an all-male discussion. The researchers often say they did their best. It is not good enough any more to say one did one's best. The practice of having all-male discussions has to be terminated. The issues of gender equality and having role models in our national broadcaster must be addressed such that young Irish children from diverse backgrounds, be they Irish-Polish, Irish-Nigerian or Irish Traveller, can say, "That person reflects who I am." The national broadcaster should proactively seek presenters who are the face of this country and regularly give opportunities to express viewpoints. A creeping issue concerning some of our political programming, particularly our flagship programming, is our giving of platforms to people whom I would describe as little more than cartoon racists. I do not understand why flagship political programmes in RTE feel the need, in order to have entertainment value and ignite a row, to give a platform to dangerous people with dangerous viewpoints and no political mandate at all. Sometimes they are shipped in from abroad. These are people whose nastiness and vitriol are likely to have a very damaging effect on Irish society, yet they are given a platform for the purpose of ratings. I do not expect much from other broadcasters but I do expect a lot more from RTE. If "Claire Byrne Live" or the "The Late Late Show" are to give a platform to a cartoon racist, a comic-book racist, we have to call it out. It is not good enough. It may be good for ratings but it is not good for society. The Minister needs to be very clear on that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is definitely the case.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will the Leader at the earliest opportunity invite the next Taoiseach to come to the House to pick through a few issues? We assume the next Taoiseach will be the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar. I described him yesterday as the John Terry of Irish politics for taking credit for things in which he had little or no involvement.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The other day I was peeking through his list of accomplishments. He has claimed credit for the introduction of paternity leave, with which he had nothing to do, and free GP care for the under-sixes, with which again he had nothing to do. I was also flicking through his policy document which I can only assume he put together with his campaign manager, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. There is not one mention of mental health in it. I find it particularly odious that two Dublin private school boys are lecturing the rest of the country on how the poor should behave.I find it particularly odious that this Fine Gael leadership campaign has been paid for in part by the taxpayer. I listened to Deputy Leo Varadkar yesterday talking about this fraud campaign. It is amazing he did not find it within his capability to talk about the fraud perpetrated on the Irish people and the release of Seánie FitzPatrick. I do not remember any other campaign he talked about which was plastered all over Dublin Bus vehicles. I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Lynn Ruane said that if anyone in this Chamber or this country were about to assume the highest office in this land, one would assume that individual would be trying to unite people. However, what Deputy Varadkar and his buddy are doing is trying to create a culture of blame, victimisation and assumption that some people get up and work hard and some people do nothing and some people pay for everything and some people pay for nothing. I suggest we have been through too much over the past ten years - the hurt, cuts, economic collapse, social collapse, emigration and unemployment - to finally come out of that situation and have a celebration last year of our new republic, only to be about to elect to the highest office in the land someone who thinks some people pay for things and other people do not. Deputy Varadkar is running a disgusting campaign. I am disgusted he is about to become leader of this country. I am disgusted he is using taxpayers' money to do it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He has no vision to unite or bring people together.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He is using Department of Social Protection money to run a right-wing campaign-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----that victimises social welfare recipients in order to appeal to the right-wing instincts of Fine Gael members. That is exactly what he is doing, and the public is paying for it. I, therefore, suggest to the Leader that if and when this individual becomes Taoiseach, he might invite him before the House so we can pick through some of these issues with him.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In fairness, I made the invitation.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Ivana Bacik, on the work she has done on this issue and her campaigning for many years to raise issues of gender inequality in many spheres. In fact, we had a discussion on this issue only last night in respect of broadcasting. As somebody whose own mother was forced to leave her employment when she got married in the late 1960s and as somebody who taught in an all-girls school, it is remarkable that we have moved a long way in such a period. Often, however, when talk turns to issues of gender equality, there can be a little disinterest and an assumption that everything is okay in this country. This is aside from issues associated with the health sphere, on which I know we will touch again, and the constitutional impediments affecting women's health. In the work sphere, however, it can be assumed that all is well, but that is certainly not the case. When my party was most recently in government, we sought to address this matter in a number of ways. One of the issues we tackled, in respect of which Ms Kathleen Lynch was very forthright, was that of having gender equality requirements for State boards, with a minimum percentage of female participation. It was not a question of a general statistic but one across all types of board. It was not good enough to have 90% male representation on financial boards and 90% female participation on child care-type boards; there had to be a gender balance on all boards. In Germany the authorities have legislated for gender equality on commercial and state boards. Perhaps we might look for this in the future. Just as Senator Ivana Bacik has done in this Bill, it is important to start with the carrot and work with employers and unions to ensure all jof these measures can be addressed properly. When we were in government, we were trying to ensure a legislative basis for the protection of workers' rights in the low-pay sector. Women are disproportionately affected in this and other vulnerable sectors. It is they who work in these areas. When we were defending the joint labour committee and the employment regulation order system and establishing the Low Pay Commission and increasing the minimum wage, we noted that a disproportionate number of women worked in the affected sectors. That is why the conversation we had, the measures implemented and the concept of having decency underpin the economy were so important. We need, however, to go further constantly and work harder. We still have a very gender-based education system. Whenever I talk about gender inequality, I talk about this issue. It is one we really need to grasp. At primary and secondary levels in many parts of the country - it may be more of an urban than a rural phenomenon - we are still quite comfortable with gender-based schooling. We separate children on the basis of gender, even at the age of four years. I acknowledge that there probably has not been sanction for a single-gender school since the 1980s, but we still need to have a national conversation about this issue. While we are happy to talk about gender equality in adulthood, we are not necessarily as happy to discuss what is blatantly and glaringly obvious to many in many communities, namely, the separation of children on the basis of gender, particularly at primary level.Now we have to have a national conversation about this. While we are happy to talk about gender equality in adulthood, we are not necessarily as happy to discuss what is blatantly obvious to many people in many communities, that is, why we are separating children, particularly at primary level. At second level that conversation can be more difficult. People point to supposedly reputable surveys about the performance level of boys versus girls at second level, research that has been largely discredited. One would wonder why we have such a gender obsession when it comes to the Irish education system, which inevitably leads to gender stereotyping and to a certain type of gender-related subject choices that has a knock-on effect on the workplace.  I understand the Minister has to leave but I thank him for his attention. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to the House. All these issues are interrelated and while we cannot grasp them all at once, we need a huge amount of buy-in across many Departments and sectors in order to really hammer this home. I have mentioned vulnerable work and the education sector. When we were in government, we organised a conference around the issue of gender equality in the workplace and even at that conference there were those male executives who were still scratching their heads and wondering what the big deal was. It was not something that they actually considered a real issue. It is, however, and if we are going to address it, as we are trying to do with this Bill, it is important to be as inclusive and as non-accusatory as possible in the early stages. We need to use a collaborative approach, encouraging rather than sanctioning. I suggest to the Minister that if there comes a stage where companies are not playing ball or not seen to be embracing this new initiative, he may have to use the stick. The workplace is so important to somebody's identity and when I was a Minister of State we dealt with the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and we tried to ensure that workplaces were LGBT-friendly. What eventually happened was that the corporate world discovered that the productivity of workers would be better if they had a more equality-based outlook when it came to dealing with their employees. Surprise, surprise, there actually is a cold, capitalist argument for equality. Senator Bacik and I would never have assumed that would be the case but we have learned many things along the way. When dealing with corporations, the business sector, business leaders and employers, there is a strong argument to be made about productivity and about happiness in the workplace in terms of addressing issues of gender pay gaps. That is what the Bill is attempting to do, bringing in an agency of the State to ensure that the gender pay gap is addressed. It has been attempted in other jurisdictions, as has been outlined, and it has been successful. While we appreciate the Government is not opposing the Bill, we were slightly disappointed by the Minister's speech, which pointed out the number of difficulties the Government has with it. That is okay, however. We can work together to iron out these things and we can move forward together in a collaborative fashion. Gender equality is a real issue in every workplace and in every facet of Irish society and Senator Bacik and the Labour Party group are bringing forward practical, reasonable and sustainable measures that will make a difference in the long run.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Now, now.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank Senator Ruane for her excellent opening speech and the Civil Engagement group for facilitating the debate on the Bill, which the Labour Party and other parties across the House support. In a situation like this, it is very tempting to play the political ball, but we should not do that today. There is a reason this Bill may not necessarily pass Second Stage. I would rather not focus on that. We need to focus less on the politics and more on the humanity of what we are trying to achieve. This is the most important Bill that will come before this Oireachtas and this is probably the most important speech I will make during my time in the Seanad. If what I and others say manages to change the mind of one person who has the potential to allow this Bill to pass further, then I do not think I will ever say anything more important. Drugs are everywhere in Irish society. There are gardaí, members of the Judiciary and politicians, including Cabinet members, who have in the past taken illegal drugs. The same is true of teachers, nurses and journalists. However, none of us would suggest that they are criminals for taking illegal drugs at one point. The reality is that this war on drugs is actually a war on poor people. They are the ones who are criminalised. As Senator Ruane quite rightly said, we are criminalising marginalisation. When I spent a short time as Minister of State with responsibility for equality and drugs, I met groups representing the LGBT community and people with disabilities and those advocating for Traveller rights who told me that those who are disconnected are more likely to fall into addiction. Of course, we know that deprivation causes people to fall into addiction. The opposite of addiction is not sobriety; the opposite of addiction is connection. We will not connect people with mainstream society if we give them criminal sanctions. It is just not working. I plead with anybody who thinks it is working or is pushing people away from addiction or drug use to take a trip to any court, particularly the drug court. What he or she will find is a courtroom full of sick of people. Worse than that, they will find a courtroom full of sick poor people. There is a level of power involved in this and it is not just politics that is to blame for not taking action sooner. We have come a long way in a short time.It is only a few short weeks ago when the Minister of State sat in that chair and together we passed, without amendment, the injecting centre legislation - ground-breaking stuff that will save lives. There is a common perception, a common mistrust and a dehumanisation of the addict. We all know the names of those groups I named earlier used to be called. I refer to the LGBT community, the Traveller community, people with disabilities, asylum seekers and poor people. They were disparaging names, dehumanising names and undermining names that are not used in common parlance any more but one can still call somebody a junkie any hour of the day on any media outlet and get away with it. One could probably use it in this Chamber and in the other Chamber and not be censured for it. A young man died of an overdose in St. Audeon's Park in November 2015. The person who found him dead rang the emergency services and said "It is just another junkie". What we are really dealing with here is power and the power that we think people in addiction and their families have. What we have managed to do by criminalising them is to make them full of shame. They will not come forward and talk about the services they need. They will not come forward and talk about the lives they are living because criminalisation is shaming them. We are shaming people into graves. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe. If the system was working our statistics would show something completely different. Senator Ruane, the Civil Engagement group, other parties and me are not trying to engage in some liberal loonyfest. Many of us believe in having a drug-free society but we are realists and we know that drugs are everywhere and that people are going to continue to take them but it is how we deal with the person who is sucked into addiction that is the key. Do we have that person interface with a garda, a judge in a court room or the prison system or do we say the person is better off dealing with a doctor, counsellor or suasion service? Do we think a young person from a broken home in a disadvantaged area who begins to dabble in drug use and who gets a criminal sanction will change his or her ways? If I got a criminal conviction as a teenager or in my early 20s I would probably say "That is me done. Society has just made a decision on me", but I would also know that I have only got a criminal sanction because I am poor. What we are trying to deal with here is one of the biggest killers in Irish society. It is also one of the biggest lies. The war on drugs is a lie. It cannot be won. It is a war on people - a certain type of people. When we talk about decriminalisation, which is a word that gets us in trouble all the time because people think we are talking about legalisation, which we are not.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are talking about decriminalisation of the person, not of the drug. We must take the person out of the criminal justice system and deal with addiction in the way it should be dealt with. It is not about the substances it is about the issues and connection. I hope my words have gone some way towards convincing people of what they should do in this regard and in terms of this debate. I thank those who have educated me along this road including people from CityWide and Ana Liffey. The Union of Students in Ireland also supports this initiative, as does Fr. Peter McVerry, who told me at a public meeting I held in my constituency recently that he was in court with a young man last year who was charged with possession of cannabis worth €2. What a complete and utter waste of time. Our criminal justice system should be targeted at the pushers not the takers of drugs.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are all allowed to change our minds on that one.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to be associated with the good wishes to Deputy Enda Kenny as he resigns as Taoiseach today. However, I am filled with nervousness about what is coming next for two main reasons. I join Senator McDowell in requesting the new Taoiseach's presence in this Chamber. Yesterday, we learnt that this new Government arrangement will be supported by Deputy Michael Lowry, an individual who will be up in court in April accused of-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a known fact and it is on the record of this House that the reputation of this individual-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Okay. This individual has accepted in the past to have used the tax amnesty facility-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Okay. I will make the point in a different way, if I might. It is already interesting to see the measures that have been taken by the incoming Taoiseach as to who he seeks support from. Deputy Leo Varadkar accused the now Senator James Reilly, who was then a Deputy and a Minister, of doing something that looked like a stroke in his constituency. There was an announcement today that the Garda station in Stepaside will be reopened. This is from the Minister, Deputy Ross, who apparently came into politics to get rid of stroke politics, wants an independent Judiciary and does not want to have any political interference in the judicial system, yet he is now able to announce, just as the new Cabinet is going to be announced, that he himself has got his Garda station reopened. The new Administration is supported by Deputy Lowry and also by someone who has got a nice little Garda station open for himself in his own constituency. Is this the new politics that we can expect from the new Taoiseach?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The new Taoiseach has built his reputation on a welfare fraud campaign. It is remarkable how tough he is on those who are weak and how weak he is on those who are tough.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I look forward to raising these issues with him when he arrives in this Chamber.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is extremely fitting that Limerick has been mentioned in the previous contribution. I do welcome the fact that the University of Limerick has announced it will be a sanctuary university. It is UN World Refugee Day. However, I wish to raise an issue which perhaps the Taoiseach himself could come into the Chamber to discuss, namely, the comments made by a Fine Gael councillor in Limerick, Stephen Keary, who is due to become the next Mayor of Limerick. It is fantastic that the University of Limerick will become a sanctuary university and it is wonderful that we have laudable statements on UN World Refugee Day but that individual has made racist, anti-immigrant statements in recent weeks. Our own Labour Party councillor in that part of the world, Elena Secas, who is of Moldovan extraction, is disgusted by what he said. The new leader of Fine Gael does not seem to find the capacity within himself to censure the councillor, criticise him or perhaps even expel him from the Fine Gael Party, or at least make sure that his name does not go forward to be the first citizen of Limerick.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hold on, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is the era of new politics. We now have a new Taoiseach who, in the context of the person that he is and his background-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----for many people represents a new opportunity for this country. We have five appointees to positions as Ministers of State not one of whom is a woman. We also have a councillor in Limerick making racist comments. This individual is due to be Mayor of Limerick and there is absolutely no word from the Taoiseach on the matter. I would like to discuss the-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----comments made by this individual at a public forum in Limerick over which he is standing. These were anti-immigrant and racist comments-----

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to know what the Leader believes the response of his party and the Taoiseach should be-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----to a councillor who is making racist and anti-immigrant comments.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is he welcome in Fine Gael and should he be Mayor of Limerick?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is about allowing people to have their say.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«"A major drain on the State."
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«"Stick a chain on them."
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is the reality of it. In my party he would have been kicked out.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am out of order? This joker down in Limerick is out of order.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I have read his remarks and I do not believe he has apologised.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With the greatest respect, I hope nobody is listening to this man.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Do we take racism seriously or not?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I second the amendment proposed by Senator Higgins. This is an issue from which politicians - not in my party but others - have run away for many years. It took more than 20 years for the Supreme Court judgment of 1992 to be enacted and legislated for. That legislation almost brought down the Government. It forced the resignation of a number of members of that Government and a new political party was formed as a result. Senator Higgins has proposed a substitution facility whereby if somebody is not in a position to attend a committee hearing, somebody else can stand in in his or her place. It seems to be perfectly reasonable to have quite a number of people involved in the process. I agree with Senator Higgins that the formation of this committee leaves a lot to be desired. At the very least we are now talking about the eighth amendment and the potential for a referendum. It is quite remarkable that a committee dealing with this most sensitive of Irish political subjects would not allow a substitution mechanism. It is rumoured that the Leader will be the Chairman of the committee. We will see what happens tomorrow. I put him on notice that my party will not support any outcome that goes any way short of full repeal of the eighth amendment. I look forward to hearing other political parties' view on that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish, if I may, to strike a celebratory note, particularly as this is Pride week. While we can often be very critical of the country in which we live, this week we can, in the context of various issues, take stock of the huge advances that have taken place in the past 25 years, not least thanks to the gentleman sitting right in front of me, Senator Norris.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I watched a programme on RTE last night, "A Different Country" which went through the personal stories of people who lived in Ireland before homosexuality was decriminalised. Many of them had quite moving tales to tell. We have made great advances in recent years - from marriage equality to the Children and Family Relationships Act, the amendment of section 37 of the Employment Equality Act, the Gender Recognition Act and other measures that have taken place in this House. However, in this week it would be foolish of us to assume that everything is okay. We still have a lot of work to do. In many parts of the country, LGBT young people still feel very afraid of coming out and of being who they are. I suggest to the Leader that perhaps we should take the opportunity to reassess where we stand in terms of LGBT rights because it is one thing to get equality in law but it is another thing to get equality in society. We need to focus on three areas as we celebrate the great advances we have made in recent years. One is the area of education. Religious institutions that are hostile to the LGBT agenda and LGBT rights still have huge influence over the education system. The second area is that of sport. It is not so much the case in women's sport but I find it remarkable how few LGBT men feel comfortable about coming forward to say who they are. This matter needs to be addressed. As we celebrate Pride in Ireland this week, the most pressing issue this relates to is the fact that our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland still do not have the same rights as LGBT citizens here. They do not have the right to equal marriage. That has to be our focus as Northern Ireland is in sharp focus in the UK and in Ireland in the context of efforts to re-establish the Executive. It would be a strong message if all of us in this House across the various parties were to stand united and say that we believe it is time for Northern Ireland to introduce marriage equality. We have become a beacon of light across the world in the context of LGBT rights. Saturday will be a glorious day in Dublin, as it always is every year, for Pride week. A few years ago it would have been unbelievable to think that we would have an LGBT Leader of this House, an LGBT leader of the country and LGBT members of Cabinet without much comment or fuss. That does not seem to make any difference whatsoever to the vast majority of Irish people. We have a long way to go in terms of those three points, namely, the education system, where we stand in the context of sport and where our fellow citizens in Northern Ireland stand. Let us take a moment to celebrate how far we have come and to celebrate Pride this week.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If they actually paid tax, that would be nice.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I inquire about the status of the School Admissions Bill. On the anniversary of publication of its school admissions Bill to deal with the baptism barrier, the Labour Party is dependent on the Government to allow Government time to allow the Bill to proceed. It is not offering a perfect solution in dealing with the baptism barrier but it would prioritise geography over religion in school admissions. The Government's Bill is a classic case of bending the knee to powerful interests, including the Catholic Church and the fee-paying school body, in that it completely side-steps the baptism barrier issue and allows the continuation of the right of children of past pupils of fee-paying schools to attend the school attended by their parents. In its Bill the Labour Party proposes that 10% of the school body be made up of such students but Fine Gael believes the figure should be set at 25%. Any rational thinking person would not allow such a provision to be included at all. It is unbelievable a school would demand that a particular number of children of past pupils be accommodated. How is a student whose parents did not attend second-level education to gain admission to a school? Such students should not have to compete for a place with a student who has an absolute entitlement through a royal blood line to attend a school. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the status of the Government's watered down School Admissions Bill and the Labour Party's Bill which was published this day last year and would deal in some way with the baptism barrier? While it would not do so to the satisfaction of many, it seeks to improve the position by prioritising geography over religion. This is an issue that affects a huge number of children in the State. When it comes to vested interests, Fine Gael always bends the knee. There is no reason the Labour Party's Bill cannot proceed to the next Stage. I implore the Leader, therefore, to encourage the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to enable us to discuss the matter further.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am delighted to say the Labour Party will, of course, support the Bill, but it would be a derogation of duty if we in this House did not at least make some comment on the rushed nature of the Bill. I take exception to any accusation that we are being reckless in asking questions about the lateness of the Bill. Having said that, I was interested in the comments made by the previous speaker on the first rugby match he had attended.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They reminded me of the first international game I attended as a ten year old in 1987 with my father who never thought he would set foot in Lansdowne Road, which was interesting. It was a soccer game between Ireland and Brazil and the person who scored the winning goal was somebody who had once been expelled from the school in which my father had taught for choosing soccer over Gaelic games. That is the Ireland in which I grew up. I grew up in an environment which was quite hostile to rugby which it did not trust or like. However, as one grows up and gets older and as one's mind opens up, one begins to share experiences with other people. At this stage, I think rugby is incredibly important to this country as a game. It is incredibly emotional for Irish people to see a team of 15 men or women from every part of this Ireland, from different religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, standing shoulder to shoulder under one banner and representing one jersey. This summer we will have a rugby world cup in Ireland. We are hosting the Women's Rugby World Cup and we can be proud of that. Many comments have been made here about the economic cost or the economic benefits. That is in important debate to have, but when I think of my ten year old self in Landsdowne Road that day, the impact that game had on me was monumental. Going back to the statistics of the game in Landsdowne Road in 1987, it seems there was only about 12,000 people there. I can only imagine the impact which the Rugby World Cup will have on ten year old girls and boys if we are successful in this bid.  Sport is a wonderful thing. It is often viewed as a luxury or as not being as important as other social infrastructure or policy decisions which we have to make in this country. When I taught in an area of acute disadvantage, however, the best days we had were the days on which the children were literally on a level playing field with other, perhaps more advantaged, children. On those days we touched heaven and I could look the children in the eye and tell them that they were as good as anybody else. I could tell them that they could achieve as much as anybody else and could train, work and practise as hard as anybody else. There were no excuses as to why they could not be the best they could possibly be. I taught in a particularly disadvantaged part of the world. Sport did that.  Sport often brings people in from the margins - people who would never be seen in the mainstream media - to represent their country, often a country that has let them down. Members of the Traveller community have proudly walked out in front of an Olympic team carrying the Irish flag. Members of the unionist and loyalist communities in Belfast have represented the tricolour at the Olympic Games. Members of disadvantaged, alienated and immigrant communities across the world have represented the green. They are often derided for their English accents, even though they come from Irish communities abroad.  The power of sport can be overwhelming. It can be so uplifting and inspirational. I agree with what Senator Grace O'Sullivan said. Free-to-air broadcasting was mentioned in respect of the ability of young people, and the entire country, to connect with this event. I was horrified that the Waterford-Kilkenny game on Saturday night was only available to people who had a Sky subscription. I know we have to be careful about what we say and I know we will be accused of being reckless, but we need to adopt a mindset that this event must be something which the whole country can enjoy and will not be something which people will need a Sky subscription to watch in their living room. We all remember the wonderful family occasions of the 1990 World Cup, the 1994 World Cup and even last summer, when people connected with their families on an emotional basis in a way in which they probably never connect outside of weddings and so on. There is a feeling of connecting to a common identity when cheering on a sports team one feels strongly about.  Let us give sport the status it deserves. It is spine-tingling. It puts the hairs on the back of one's neck on end. It is something which is enshrined in our identity and which is a fantastic leveller. As I have said, people who wear the green are often people who have been let down by society but who still give everything in their sweat and their energy to represent our country. We will have a fantastic spectacle this summer with the Women's Rugby World Cup. I pray that we will have this spectacle in 2023 with the Rugby World Cup, but let us make sure that it will be accessible to all.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join others who have referred to the disgusting images in Northern Ireland. Any culture built on hate is not a culture at all. Some of the racist and sectarian imagery on these bonfires is quite disturbing and a statement from the Irish Government to this effect would be welcome. I praise Senator Ó Clochartaigh. It is refreshing to hear the questions of asylum seekers and homelessness raised simultaneously. In this country, when one raises the question of refugees or asylum seekers or related issues, one is often flooded with comments asking about the homeless from people who never have any interest in issues of homelessness otherwise. It is important that Senators in this House raise the two and note they are all part of the same social justice agenda.  There is an issue on which the Minister for Transport and Tourism, Deputy Ross, needs to come before us. It was raised on the radio this morning and relates to legislation that needs to be amended quickly. An issue arose in the court in Ballinasloe where an anomaly in the road traffic legislation emerged. It relates to the absence of the word "or" in the current legislation, which no doubt was an error when the Bill was amended. Under the previous Bill, if a garda intercepted someone they had to be guilty, or perceived to be guilty, of 1, 2 or 3 - I will not outline the offences - but in the current Bill the word "or" is missing, and the implication is that the individual must be guilty of all three offences before they can be arrested. This was accepted by the judge in Ballinasloe and has been referred to the High Court. A simple amendment by Government could solve this or else all traffic offences or drink driving offences will clog up the courts and it will be impossible to deal with these issues in the short term. A practical solution would be for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come here, propose an amendment himself in Government time to react to what happened in the Ballinasloe court and ensure that the courts are not clogged up. We can have another debate on his other Bill and matters around that but this is a practical measure that Senators could support and that would make a real difference in the legislative provisions that this House oversees.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Wow, 10 cent.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Better late than never.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. I appreciate that when dealing with his ministerial responsibilities he has inherited a system and must do his best to manage it. This is an incredibly important scheme. I benefited from this type of scheme when I was a young boy in travelling from Malahide to attend primary school in Baldoyle and I am well aware of its benefits. I raise an individual case which has been raised with the Minister of State by my party colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, relating to a Church of Ireland child in Mallow, County Cork. However, the main issue I wish to address is that I have listened to other Senators saying what an important scheme this is and how supportive they are of it. However, the Minister of State is aware, as am I, of rumours, allegations and question marks in parts of the country regarding contractors, subcontractors and so on. Perhaps it might be time for an external review of the entire system. It is an incredibly important service and access to education is fundamentally important to the State. The ability of children to access a school is hugely important, as is the ability of the State to provide the service. The Minister of State knows as well as I do that in certain parts of the country there are whispered allegations of who got what contract, how they got it and so on. This is Ireland, after all. Is the Minister of State aware of local tensions or rumours about local contracts to provide school transport? Would the Minister of State be willing to discuss the possibility of having an absolute root-and-branch investigation as to how the service is being rolled out? At €180 million annually it is a lot of money but it is money that needs to be spent to ensure that children can access their schools. At the same time, is it being spent effectively and can we find a mechanism so that everybody has trust in the system? It is my understanding from listening to colleagues around the country - and I do not believe I am saying anything here that would shock anybody - that there tends to be a level of rumour and speculation as to how and why somebody got a contract, how it is being done and how safe that individual transport agency is. I wish to raise an individual issue, which I believe the Minister of State has come across already, that relates to a child who attended a Church of Ireland school in Mallow. I know the Minister of State has corresponded with Deputy Sherlock on this issue. The child in question is Sharon Dawson, the daughter of Rachel Dawson. This is on the public record and I am not naming anyone who has not previously been named. The daughter was attending a Church of Ireland school in Mallow, County Cork, but the school is no longer in existence. The arrangement during the school closure was that the entire enrolment of that school be moved to the community national school, Scoil Aonghusa, a move which places this child outside of the 3.2 km zone for eligibility for school transport. She is being encouraged by the Department to attend a different school even though the entire enrolment of her Church of Ireland school has now decamped to the community national school. The child does not qualify, technically, for the free school transport scheme. Deputy Sherlock, the parents and others who advocate on behalf of the child are saying that the religious background of this child is militating against her. This situation could be easily rectified. It was a decision of the patron, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, to move the entire student body from school A to school B, and this child was attending that school. It would make perfect sense, therefore, that if the decision was made the child would be facilitated with the school transport scheme to enable her to attend the school. The Department, however, feels otherwise. Our education system is a complex one and is interwoven with all sorts of issues. It is very problematic with patronage and all the rest of it. Religion and faith is all woven within that. It is the system we have, is the system we have inherited and is the system we must work under. It is reasonable that if the child is part of a school body that is moved to a second school, and she is willing to attend that school, then the school transport would be provided as a result. I know the Minister of State has corresponded with Deputy Sherlock on this matter and I know the Minister of State is particularly sympathetic to the situation, but the situation persists. Will the Minister of State look at it? I also have correspondence from Canon Eithne Lynch who feels strongly about the matter. Perhaps the Minister of State could raise the issue and get it resolved. Obviously, come September it would be great if the child could be facilitated. The overall issue is that it is an incredibly important system. It is important that across the House we all acknowledge that children must be able to access school. That is fair enough. I do not think, however, that we can dismiss outright the rumour mill that happens in various parts of the country. I always get concerned when the State cannot absolutely 100% provide for services and they have to be outsourced. There is any amount of potential for conflicts of interest, for accusations and for diminution of standards. When the State is involved, at least then one can have an over and back, there is accountability and a row can be had with the Minister or the CEO of the agency. When it is sub-contracted out there is always a question mark over standards, safety and all the rest. We do not really need to go down that line again; we have had too much pain in that regard in the past. Without putting too much pressure on the Minister of State, my party and I believe that the time has probably come to make the case for an independent or external review - or whatever phraseology is needed - of the entire system and how it is working so people can have faith in the system, in the way the tenders are given out, in the way the sub-contracting arrangements are made and if they are actually fit for purpose. I appreciate that the Minister of State is dealing with a situation that he feels strongly about. I know that he is happy to meet with any delegation and any Member of the Oireachtas to deal with certain issues of concern. I ask the Minister of State to give his own reflections on whether or not a root and branch review is needed of how the entire system is being operated. I feel strongly about the situation of the child in Mallow, County Cork, and the representations made to me by Deputy Sherlock. Perhaps that matter could be resolved.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:“That Seanad Éireann:- affirming its commitment to providing equality of access to education at primary, secondary and third-level;- recognising the benefits, culturally and economically, of the historic decision to invest in publicly-funded secondary education in Ireland and recognising also that the introduction of publicly-funded third-level education further encouraged a generation of young people to attain the highest levels of education;- acknowledging that, while publicly-funded third-level access no longer exists across the board, a significant number of people, particularly those from rural and lower socio-economic backgrounds, benefit from a publicly-funded path to third-level; and- further recognising that a number of contributing factors have led to a significant gap in funding for the third-level sector and that, while this shortfall must be addressed, it cannot be at the expense of those most vulnerable in our society;- calls on the Government to affirm its commitment to providing equality of access to education for all; to reject any move to implement an income contingent loan scheme to fund third-level education; and to adopt a policy of ending college fees."I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. The Labour Party is delighted to propose the motion on access to third-level education. We are disappointed in the amendments which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have tabled on this. They seem to be clinging to the idea of student loans as a way of financing individuals' access to third level education in any way they can. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of I and my party to lay out our vision for education in this country.  I went to university in the 1990s and benefitted from the free fees scheme, as it was then called. I paid full fees in 1994, half fees in 1995 and no fees whatever in 1997. When I left college, and when the Labour Party left Government in 1997 the registration fee was around £150. By the time Labour returned to Government in 2011 that had risen to €2,000. That is a registration fee, not a tuition fee, but the subtlety of calling something a registration fee or tuition fee is irrelevant to an ordinary working family.  Before the last general election, my own party made commitments which were not lived up to. I greatly regret that but one either stands by one's belief in free education or one lets it lie and let the commitment dog one forever. What we managed to do in five years of Government was stop Fine Gael's manifesto promise of having tuition paid for through a graduate loans system. That system still features in the Cassels report which contains a number of options, including a publicly funded option which is the one we propose.  A student loan system such as the one being advocated in various quarters has been proved to be devastating wherever it has been introduced, particularly in Britain where it has saddled ordinary middle-income families and hard-working families with debt and has devastated certain aspects of third-level education, especially the arts and humanities. I strongly assert that we must have a different view and vision of education. It costs the State around €16,000 each year that a student is in second level. No one would ever suggest that individual student attending second level should pay that back over a period. There is no statutory obligation for anyone to attend school beyond the age of 16 years. We would never say to a 17 or 18 year old that they have no statutory obligation to be in school, it is costing the State €16,000, and they should therefore pay it back over a period, because we believe in the ethos and aspiration of free second-level education, as we should. One frequently made argument relates to the children of multi-millionaires but the same argument could be made about primary or second level and we contend that argument does not stand up at third level. If one benefits from third level and one's income increases as a result, then one contributes to society through a fair and progressive tax system.  I do not believe that the current Government has the same belief system in education as my party. Our party believes education is the great liberator and the great leveller. It is something that can liberate and change an individual's life, their perspective of themselves, of their entire community. I feel passionately about the way it empowers young women. I taught in an all-girls' school in an acutely disadvantaged area for 11 years. I have told as many people as possible wherever I has spoken across the world, that the most powerful thing in the world is a girl with a book. A girl who can read changes her family. A girl who can read changes her community. A girl who can read can change her entire country. The power of education is incredible, it has no borders, so why would we want to tell someone who was addressing their leaving certificate that we would give them the opportunity to attend third-level education, but once they got there they would not only leave with a qualification but with a whole lot of debt to pay off.  We refute the idea that the free fee schemes introduced in the 1990s only benefitted a certain cohort. If one looks at the access rates in 1992, 34% of leaving certificate students accessed third level. It was an elite pursuit. It was unobtainable and had a mystique around it which many in the third-level sector wanted to maintain. They wanted to maintain the idea that only for a certain cohort in Irish society should benefit from third-level education. Ten years later, in 2003, 54% of those who had done leaving certificate or equivalent now attended third level. It did benefit many families who would otherwise have looked at the financial burden and said they could not send their children to third-level education.  We understand that my party has had a chequered history on this matter. We accept that and are willing to take the criticism but collectively we need to move on. We introduced the free fees scheme in the 1990s. It was hugely beneficial and it changed many young people's perspective on education. Do we fundamentally believe that it is free or do we believe that it is a commodity? I fear the ethos coming from the Department of Education and Skills which is also evident in primary level in the way in which the Minister thinks the most important thing for a child to learn is coding. We are not dealing with economic units that fit into an economy. Education is much more fundamental and important to a person's aspirations than that. We should not commodify education. The idea that we send the young people of this country, the students, that they would be saddled with student debt that they must repay over years flies in the face of the ethos and vision that a modern republic should have.We want to change the whole basis of this argument. We want to change the thrust and where this debate is going. We have to stop the thrust of the argument going from how, can or should students pay to how the State should pay. The current position taken on this issue is disappointing after everything we have gone through in this country in terms of the economic collapse and the social hurt and the wounds we have all experienced in recent years. When we speak to colleagues in the UK, we find the unquestionable and untouchable political principle of the collective system in the UK - the sacred cow of British politics - is equality in health. If we talk to anyone in Finland, we find the unquestioning sacred cow of their political system that everyone buys into is equality in education. For some reason, the unquestionable sacred cow of Irish politics is not equality in health or education but the 12.5% corporation tax rate. That is what we have reduced ourselves to. This is the thing we cannot discuss. It cannot be discussed at any level in the political spectrum. Maybe we should begin to ask these corporations, which benefit from highly trained, skilled and educated young people, to contribute. There is a national training fund, as the Minister of State is well aware. It is paid for through employers' PRSI. It accumulates approximately €200 million and almost matches the estimated €222 million that it would cost to abolish third-level fees. We are suggesting that those who benefit from this highly trained and educated workforce should contribute by way of a graduate tax towards the funding of third-level education in this country. I do not believe for a moment the scaremongering and protests that they will go away and find somewhere else to base themselves. They are here for the 12.5% corporation tax. However, they are also here because we are soon to be the only English-speaking member of the European Union and we have a highly skilled and educated workforce. Perhaps it is because of my background and where I taught. Perhaps it is because of the children who inspire me every day of my political life. I have seen how education, day by day, has improved their lives. It is often said that free fees or the abolition of fees would not affect access to third-level education by acutely disadvantaged communities and that it did not affect access in the 1990s. There are myriad overlapping and various reasons why access rates from those communities are not as they should be. The statistics are obvious in the Hart and Risley report from 1995. The average three year old from a welfare dependent family has one third the oral capacity and one third of the vocabulary of a three year old from a professional family. The gulf is there by three years of age. One third of children leaving DEIS schools after sixth class have basic reading problems. The issue in terms of access to third-level education in acutely disadvantaged areas is far more complex than a financial barrier. Financial considerations exist but, on account of the grant system, which almost 50% of students avail of, it is not the same. It is relevant for those who are always outside that cohort and outside any means test, those who year by year make a determination about how many of their children can access third level because of financial concerns. I believe the Minister of State would have support from across this House, notwithstanding the disappointing amendments from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, if she made a strong statement. What we want is a strong statement from the Minister of State as the newly appointed Minister of State with responsibility for higher education who has an education background and who, like me, was a principal of a primary school. She sits at Cabinet and has an influential role in this Government. We want the Minister of State to make a commitment to the House that the Government has absolutely no intention of pursuing the concept of a graduate loan scheme and that the Government completely agrees with the vision of absolutely free access to third-level education. We can understand that there are financial constraints and that it may take several years to achieve it. However, it would at least be an improvement if the vision was there, no more than any other social justice issue in this country, whether homelessness, housing, illiteracy or whatever. At least if the vision is there from within Government, there is a chance. Our aspiration is that access to third-level education would be absolutely free and that those who pay for it pay through general taxation. I do not believe that people should be taxed on the basis of their education. They should be taxed on the basis of their wealth. If the Minister of State supported a graduate tax or a student loan scheme, she would be effectively taxing someone on the basis of their education and not on the basis of their wealth or income. Such schemes have been disastrous wherever they have been introduced. I want to live in a society of highly educated individuals, including nurses, doctors, teachers and, God help us, even politicians who are a benefit to the State every day of their working lives. They should not be saddled with debt. Education is not a commodity or a privilege; it a right. Any proposed student loan scheme would be a barrier to that right. That is why we feel so strongly about this issue and that is why we have put down the motion this evening.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank everybody who has contributed to the debate, particularly those Senators who are supporting the motion. I am a little disappointed by the negativity in the Chamber and those who are intent on engaging in a party political point-scoring exercise. If they read the motion, they will see that there is not one negative word in it. It is aspirational and seeks something better for young people and potential third level students. It does not attempt to criticise anybody or the current or any past Government. Contributions which sought to score cheap political points do not reflect well. Having said that, I was a little taken aback when the Minister of State and representatives of the Government in the House suggested we should not even be discussing this issue because a committee was engaged in a wide discussion on it. We had a similar discussion yesterday, when the Government at very short notice had to ram through the Rugby World Cup Bill and we were told that we were being reckless and almost treacherous for even suggesting or raising questions as to why it was being done so quickly. It would be much appreciated by me, the Labour Party and everybody who supports the motion if the Minister of State gave her own view that she was against an income contingent student loan system. It would be extremely welcome if she, or the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, were to make that statement. The committee would very much appreciate knowing the parameters within which it would have to do its work. However, the Minister of State has not done this. To be honest, for her to state we should somehow be extremely appreciative or welcome the fact that she has not made any decision or that no decision has been made on the issue will not satisfy those in the Visitors Gallery who feel very strongly about it or those of us who feel very strongly about third level education.Again, I find the accusation of populism remarkable. As Senator Gerald Nash most eloquently said, the summer economic statement references the €220 million the Government wants to give in tax breaks. It matches exactly the amount of money it would cost to abolish third level fees. Therefore, claims about where the Government is supposed to find the money and accusations of populism fall down completely, even on the Government's figures. This is about choices. People say it is not about the left or the right or ideology, but it is. If the Government decides to give back €220 million in tax breaks, it is making an ideological decision that is more right wing than left wing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«These are choices the Government can make. If the Minister of State believes in free education, it is not good enough to say, "I believe in free education, but..." If the Government believes in free education, it should put the money into the system. At this stage in the game no one in Ireland is going to be bought off with the idea of tax cuts; what they want is service provision. I want to finish by referencing some of the contributions made yesterday at the briefing organised by Senator Ivana Bacik which was enlightening for anyone who was present. The last presentation was made by Mr. Kevin Donoghue, chairperson of Labour Youth. He referred to the glory of the sound of a pen on paper, the glory of the anxiety young people felt at examination time and the glory of the pride in the voice of parents when they spoke about their children going to college. People who have benefited from third level education and do not know anyone who has not gone to third level education and think everyone else is just like them do not understand the power of the words "college" and "university" or the bizarre fact that even examination time anxiety is so liberating.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The folder under the arm of a student is such a powerful symbol for the family and everyone in the community of what that student is doing and learning and how he or she is being empowered through life. I put it to the Minister of State that the last thing a student needs, aside from a folder under the arm, is anxiety about how he or she will pay for education in the future. Instead, a student should feel the excitement and anxiety that come with a learning experience. I use the term "anxiety" because it is part of the entire university experience. It is part of getting through the system and working through examinations. I realise it was a strange example to give, but I understand exactly what Mr. Kevin Donoghue was talking about. There can be no return to a situation envisaged in 2011 in the Fine Gael manifesto which referred to a student loan scheme to fill the gap. We must have a better vision. We have to look forward and aspire to having a free third level system. The Government's amendment is not one we can support. I take the same view of Fianna Fáil's amendment. Let us move beyond party political point-scoring. Let us accept that free education is a right and an aspiration and something to which we can collectively work towards. It would be beneficial if Ministers in areas of authority in the Department of Education and Skills could say categorically that a student loan scheme was out and that they believed in equality in and equality of access to education. It would be beneficial if it was clear that the aspiration of the Government was free access to education for all. Everyone in the House would support it in that regard.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise an issue of concern to many people across Dublin in relation to schools selling off their lands and the resultant impact on local communities. I understand from this morning's newspaper and a conversation I had with Councillor Deirdre Kingston of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that Clonkeen College, a Christian Brothers school, has sold its land. This is of huge disappointment to the local community because there has been significant State investment in the school, including an upgrade of the playing pitches that are now to be lost to the local community as a result of the school's decision to sell. Two schools in my constituency have made similar decisions. St. Paul's College, Raheny, was given land by Dublin City Council in the 1950s on the understanding that it be kept for recreational use but that land was sold to a developer several years ago, and St. Mary's Holy Faith, Killester, is currently selling its lands. It is disappointing that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is taking a hands-off approach to this issue. Even though the State has invested money in these schools and had a relationship with them, he does not seem to have any interest in getting involved or commenting on the fact that local communities are losing facilities in the schools. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House when he is available and it is appropriate in order for the issue to be discussed because if there are two schools in my constituency and one school in Councillor Deirdre Kingston's constituency in which this has happened in a very short period of time, I am quite sure that every area of the country will have a similar problem in the months and years to come. I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate that debate. On a lighter note, I wish two journalists from TV3 the very best in their retirement. To hear that Vincent Browne is to retire from his role as the presenter of "Tonight with Vincent Browne" is a little like hearing of the retirement of a teacher who used to give one detention all the time. There is the same emotion that he is moving on and a guarded regard for the fact that even though there were battles, one will be sad to see him go. I also want to acknowledge Ursula Halligan, who has announced that she is to leave TV3. My greatest memory of Ursula was not necessarily a journalistic one, although I do remember she forced Deputy Enda Kenny to trip over a flower pot while asking him how strongly he felt about the marriage equality issue. I also remember an incredible article she wrote that was published in The Irish Times. I vividly remember sitting outside a gym at around 7 a.m., reading online her article about her life, sexuality and journey to the realisation of who she was and openly weeping, touching my face and feeling tears coming down my cheeks as I read her words. It was a very powerful statement and she stepped outside the journalistic sphere for that referendum. What she did that week touched the hearts of a huge number of people in Ireland. I wish to acknowledge that she has moved on from her position in TV3 and wish her all the best for the future.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for attending. He will not need me to remind him that the scale and nature of the housing crisis affecting not just this city, but the entire country, is the greatest social challenge of our time. The Government recognises this and many initiatives have been undertaken to address the issue. One of the proposals that have been made by the Peter McVerry Trust seems eminently sensible. It aims to utilise the amount of space that is available or vacant, particularly in Dublin city, to house people. The Minister of State knows as much as anyone the long-term damage any stint in homelessness or insecurity of housing can cause, especially to young children, for whom the damage can last the rest of their lives. Ireland has a particular understanding of that issue. The Minister of State will accept that the Peter McVerry Trust is a credible and compassionate organisation whose heart is in the right place. It has worked with a number of Ministers in recent years on trying to find practical solutions to the housing problem. It has identified approximately 10,000 units that it believes would be beneficial in addressing the housing crisis. It describes them as over-the-shop units. Added to the estimated 33,000 empty residential units across this city and further afield, this would go a long way towards addressing the issues. There are other housing projects, for example, the interesting Abhaile Project, which recently won an award for redeveloping the upper storeys of large, four-bedroom or three-bedroom occupancies that had just one person living in them in a bid to alleviate some of our issues. The over-the-shop phenomenon has been identified by the Peter McVerry Trust as a practical means through which the city council, with support from the Minister of State's Department, can address some of the housing shortages. The trust, supported by the city council, has suggested that approximately 10,000 people could be provided with accommodation in these empty or under-used spaces in the upper floors of buildings. The Peter McVerry Trust is trying to think imaginatively.It is clear from an audit of the empty spaces that are available in the city that the over-the-shop phenomenon would provide spaces and places where housing could be easily provided for families who are in need. How seriously does the Government view the submission made by the Peter McVerry Trust this month to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for a national re-use strategy? I am sure the Minister has the submission and has studied it in great depth. It makes huge sense. While the conversation is always about building new units and estates, which is understandable, that process is quite lengthy. Obviously, it is necessary to go through the planning process and that can be quite exhaustive and difficult. The case we are making here is to look at existing buildings, units and spaces that are under-utilised. We believe there are 10,000 of them in Dublin city alone and we ask the Department to take the submission from the Peter McVerry Trust seriously, engage with Dublin City Council and begin the process of utilising these units to house our people.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State's response is reasonably positive. I get the sense that the issue of vacancy hot spots, as they were described, is being taken seriously and that the Minister is happy to engage with local authorities on it. I am a little disappointed with the suggestion that the publication of the strategy could be delayed until after the summer, but I understand these things happen occasionally. Given the nature of the crisis, many would suggest that delays of that nature would be disappointing. Perhaps the Minister of State might give me another verbal reassurance that he is aware of the submission from the Peter McVerry Trust and that he understands there are an estimated 10,000 over-the-shop units in Dublin city alone. This is part of the jigsaw of measures that can be used to solve the crisis. I hope all submissions to the Department are accepted in the spirit in which they are submitted.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am delighted to hear Fianna Fáil's sudden interest in the size of classes. I join the party's representatives to raise the issue, as well as to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. I remind the Fianna Fáil representatives in this House that the previous Government managed to protect class sizes in their entirety and bring them down in the last budget over which we had influence. There is a line in the confidence and supply agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that says they would reduce class sizes. It was not acted upon in the previous budget and there was no reduction in class sizes at primary level. Rather than make speeches in this House, I suggest the leadership of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael implement the agreement they signed together. The initiative would cost around €6 million but it was not acted upon in the previous budget and they have no one to blame except themselves. With the Cathaoirleach and the Leader's permission, I request a change be made to the Order of Business. I formally request that No. 24, Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill - First Stage, which the Labour Party launched today, be taken before No. 1.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that we take No. 21, the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill 2017, before No. 1. Tacaím leis an méid atá ráite leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar dhíospóireacht ó thaobh chúrsaí Gaeilge de. Tá sé thar am go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin againn anseo. Ba chóir go rachaidh sé ar aghaidh ar feadh dhá uair a chloig ar a laghad, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir féin. My last point is to support what Senator Bacik said about the recent report on conditions for children in direct provision. It is a matter of pride to this House that Members, collectively and across parties, have taken the matter of direct provision so seriously. A number of debates on the issue took place both in this Seanad and the previous one. Can we not, for the love of God, implement the report of the working group on direct provision, which was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon? I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, be invited back to the House, but I know, because I was once in his position, that he is not necessarily the person with the last call on these issues. That is the Minister for Justice and Equality. There is a new Minister for Justice and Equality and he has expressed concern about, and interest in, this issue in the past. I ask the Leader to invite him to the House in the autumn, with the express intention of committing to implementing the McMahon report on the protection and direct provision systems. Many Members of this House want the direct provision system to be abolished, but we are simply asking that the McMahon report on the system, which is more than two years old and which was a compromise with the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that were invited to take part in the working group, be implemented to the letter and in full. That is not too much to ask in this day and age. We are scarring the lives of children, in particular, who are still in the direct provision system.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank and congratulate the Civil Engagement group for bringing this piece of legislation before the House. I was involved in the original International Protection Act and many of these issues were raised at the time, but we were advised that all worries or concerns relating to the Bill were overstated, that this was the European norm and it had to happen and needed to be guillotined because of time sensitivity. It had to happen because of the direct provision report, and if it was passed, we would get a single procedure mechanism which every NGO and every international organisation was calling for us to have. After it was passed, the President, for the second time in his term of office, had to call the Council of State to see if it was constitutional. Now we have a situation of asylum seekers being handed 60-page documents to go through of which they have to make some kind of sense. The Seanad is now debating an amendment to the legislation in order to give justification to family rights of asylum-seekers. I have deep reservations about the capacity of the Minister's Department to deal with this issue. Running right through his Department is a suspicion of anybody who comes to this country seeking asylum. I think there is mistrust and a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the problem. I cannot remember a single meeting that I had with a senior official in the Minister's Department when I was in it as a Minister of State, working with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, where the term "pull factor" was not used. I do not think the Minister's Department has any capacity to deal with this issue. The entire area of asylum, integration and immigration needs to be taken out of it because the Department comes to this issue with a justice and defence mentality, a law and order mentality, and does not come to the issue with a sense of humanitarianism or decency. The Department sees the issue as a problem. I have come to the conclusion that the Department believes that half the people who are seeking asylum, if not more, are just liars. I have to say, reluctantly, that that is the sense I get from working in the Minister's Department. It breaks my heart after all the time I spent in that Department and every direct provision centre I visited. I know the Minister lives close to one in Portlaoise. The parish priest there has to be greatly commended on what he has said about that direct provision centre. A group of NGOs was invited by that Department to sit around the table with Department officials to come up with a direct provision report, which was a compromise on everybody's part. On the day that the report was announced, I made the comment at the press conference that this was the report that would be implemented because the Department had signed off on it. The then Minister for Justice and Equality sat there and said that it gives food for thought. It is a disgusting disgrace that not a single letter of that report has been implemented by now. When we had the Action Plan for Jobs, we had three-monthly or four-monthly updates, great fanfare and press conferences to say what had been achieved and which recommendations had been fulfilled. What has happened in the two years since the direct provision report was published? A couple of easy to fulfil recommendations were followed through. Every NGO that took part in that process did so with the best will in the world, and many had been mandated to call for the abolition of the process and signed away that mandate when they signed off on that document as a compromise because they thought the situation would be improved. What happened? It was not implemented in full, mainly, I believe, because the people with concerns are people who are not politically powerful. It is a disgrace, and that is why I think the Department is completely incapable. It hurts me to say that because I know many of the people in the Department and worked very closely with them, but the ethos and sense in the Department is of no sympathy and no humanitarianism when it comes to this issue. I genuinely believe that it does not belong in the Department any more. I fully concur with what Senator Boyhan said. It is the height of hypocrisy for this independent Republic to go anywhere and talk to anybody else about immigration rights.What a joke. What an international joke we are to end up in the White House every year asking for something to be done for the Irish abroad when we will not regularise the undocumented here in this country on the same basis and we still have one of the most restrictive asylum systems. We are one of only two European countries which does not allow asylum seekers the right to work. It is the height of hypocrisy because no European country knows what a coffin ship is like more than the Irish; no European country knows what it is like to flee a country because of violence more than the Irish; no European country knows what it is like to flee a country because of hunger more than the Irish; and no European country has a more mean-spirited asylum system than the Irish. What I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party is that despite the fact we were involved in the original international protection Bill, and given the context at the time, we fully support this Bill. As the new Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister has the opportunity to implement the McMahon report on direct provision. It would be a stunning legacy for him to leave behind if we were finally to put paid to all of the wrongs in the system. There are 1,500 fewer people in the system long term than there were two years ago, and I understand this and great credit should be given to the House for raising the issue consistently, but I go back to the fundamental point that this issue does not belong in the Department of Justice and Equality because it is not fit for purpose to deal with it on a humanitarian basis. Its mindset is one of security and law and order and it is not one that truly understands the nature of why people must flee their country because fundamentally the Department does not trust them.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join my colleagues in thanking the Cathaoirleach, the Leader of the House and the staff of the Seanad for all their professionalism and courtesy over the period we have been here. While our next period of parliamentary jousting will take place in a different environment, I am sure that professionalism will lend itself to the new surroundings as well. I raise again, as I have done in this Chamber, in written form and in oral contributions, the issue of Beaumont Hospital and the accident and emergency department which serves a huge number of people on the north side of Dublin. The problems in the Beaumont Hospital accident and emergency department persist. When I was a Member of the Dáil, the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and I met the senior management of Beaumont Hospital. The management presented us with a €45 million plan which would rectify the physical problems the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital has. I do not think one could walk anywhere around the north side of Dublin without meeting a family who have some kind of horror story from experiences in the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital. It is no reflection on the staff who work there and who work incredibly hard and incredibly well. The physical environment of that accident and emergency department needs to be rectified. I have raised it in a Commencement matter. I thank the Cathaoirleach for enabling that. I have also written letters, run campaigns and done petitions, but I do not hear anything from Government about where this capital investment is coming from or when it is going to happen. Perhaps, when we come back in September, we can have an update on that situation. The fiscal situation in the country has improved. We have an opportunity now to rectify these problems. I accept that there are other issues, including staffing, in the accident and emergency department, and the demographic in that area lends itself to having a very busy accident and emergency department. At the same time, the physical infrastructure needs to be enhanced, improved and invested in. Senior management has a plan. It wants to see that plan implemented. Everyone in this House who knows that area would agree that it needs that investment. Will the Leader facilitate a debate on that process in order that we could see those facilities being improved shortly?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I rise to raise a very sensitive issue and one which all Members should be in a position to support, which is cardiac care in Ireland and how children are dealt with. I request that we facilitate a debate in the House on this issue. I had a discussion with the parent of a child who passed away last February. The boy's name was Gavin Coyne and his mother's name is Maria. Gavin suffered from a condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy. His mother has concerns about his treatment in Crumlin children's hospital and in the Mater hospital and also the treatment of her family when they relocated to Newcastle for further treatment. She is not asking for anything for her family now as nothing can be done for Gavin, he having passed away at ten years of age. He leaves behind a grieving family, classmates and friends. However, his mother has questions in relation to how the entirety of care for children with such illnesses is handled in Ireland. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the House on cardiac care for children. I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House to speak not just to this issue and case but the general issue of the service that is available for such children. I will write to ask the Minister to meet with the family but in the House it is more appropriate to address the general issue. A young child has died and possibly unnecessarily so. This case leads me to believe that further investigation is needed into how we care for children who suffer from these serious ailments and I make that request of the Leader.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ridiculous.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Women can be in charge of cars but not their own bodies, then.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The last time I spoke on this issue, the Minister described my contribution as bizarre and extraordinary. I hope my contribution is a bit more to his liking today. I wish to inform the House that on the anniversary of the election of Donald Trump, 8 November, in Liberty Hall, there will be an event called Irish Stand, raising funds directly for young people in direct provision. There is a youth project with which the Irish Refugee Council is involved which is in danger of closure. Performers including Senator Frances Black and others will be performing on the night. On 8 November last year, everybody felt a little bit colder and the world seemed a little bit less generous. I am very critical of the Government's attitude towards this issue, as the Minister knows. In the draft programme for Government there was a sentence in black and white, which I remember reading, stating that the Government would implement the recommendations of the McMahon report. When the actual programme for Government came out, that sentence had been deleted. I do not know who deleted it, if it was a political figure or somebody in the Minister's Department. It was certainly no longer there and the commitment was no longer in evidence. As Senator Norris quite rightly said, it is to be welcomed that the Minister has announced that the Government will move to enable people in the asylum system - not all of whom are in direct provision - to access the labour force. Again, as has been stated, that is on foot of a Supreme Court judgment and not anything that came from within the Government. I hope the Minister will not consider it bizarre or extraordinary for me to say that people should spend no more than six months in the system. If that were the situation, we would be able stand over the system as it is. It is very difficult to stand over a system that allows people to languish in these centres for a prolonged period. I visited many of these centres, as I am sure the Minister has. If he has not, I encourage him to do so. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton has visited a huge number of them. The stench of desperation, particularly for children, will persist in this country for an awfully long time. The aspiration of having a very short turnover in any centre must be held. I understand that the housing shortage is adding to the problems and that community welfare officers throughout the country are dealing proactively with those in direct provision who have their papers and wish to move on. The number of long-stay residents in the system has gone down. From 2015 to 2017 there was a reduction of 1,500 in the number of those in the system for more than three years. However, this should never have been allowed to occur in the first place. The system should have been reviewed five years after it came into existence, in 2005, or after ten years, in 2010. It was not until we had an agreement between Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 2014 that the system finally came to be reviewed and reformed properly. The sentence was deleted from the programme for Government. I did not see any mention of it in the confidence and supply arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Unless I am greatly mistaken, I do not remember any mention of the matter in the campaign manifesto of our current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, when he was telling the nation why he wanted to lead us. It is important to note that this House has consistently and constantly raised the issue on a cross-party basis, regardless of our political background. We are keeping it at the forefront of our minds. We want to engage with the Minister on the progress of the McMahon report. Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon is quite critical of the Government's inaction on the implementation of his report. Again, I am aware the Minister found it extraordinary the last time when I pointed out that this report was not sent out to consultants, independently written and then handed back to Government. It was signed off on by Department officials and was negotiated between Department officials, who were members of the working group, and NGOs. Sometimes when a report has been done by an expert group and handed back to the Government, people can dismiss it as being too idealistic or ideological or not being in the real world. This report was negotiated and tossed back and forth. When it was signed off on, there was an expectation that it would be implemented to the letter. Any problem the Department may have had with any of the recommendations had already been addressed. Many of the NGOs put their reputations on the line in going with the report as they had a mandate to end direct provision, and although the report was very much less than that, they were willing to go with it because they expected it to be implemented in its entirety. One of the NGOs walked away. If I were a member of any of those NGOs who acted in good faith in respect of this report, I do not know if I would have the heart to deal with the Department of Justice and Equality again. Although there was trust that the situation would be improved, over two years later we are still debating how many of the recommendations have been brought to fruition. Can we at least have the aspiration that nobody in the system will spend more than six months in a direct provision centre? Can we ensure that the long-stay residents are moved out of the system? I acknowledge that we have begun to roll out oversight, but can this be continued?Can we ensure that, when it comes to the report's implementation, we do not argue back and forth over what percentage of its recommendations has been implemented? The aspiration in what we are trying to achieve should not be a party political point-scoring exercise. Rather, it should be to achieve something for children in our care. Those children expect much better of the country of a hundred thousand welcomes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister’s initiative, which deserves support. I spent 11 years as a primary school teacher in north inner city Dublin, three of which were as a primary school principal. From going around schools speaking to principals and teachers, as the Minister does, I have noted many of them will not speak openly about the day-to-day traumas they witness because they do not want to give the school a bad name or impinge on its reputation. This is because the nature of our school system means they are all in competition with each other. It is my experience and that of people I have worked with, that schools cannot cope with children they are trying to help. It is wrong to assume that any school can adequately deal with the needs of a child. If one takes two four year olds in primary school, one knows that in nine years' time, one will have a better chance of success than the other. One child will be presented as clean, rested, fed and interested, while the other will not. If we are going to talk about the well-being of students, we have to have a wider approach in dealing with parents. It is a well-known fact that the average three-year old from a poor family has one third the oral language capacity of a three-year old from a rich family. There is only so much teachers can do because they do not live in schools. The reality is that children will have a different perspective on life once they go outside the school gates. They know and are well-trained and well-drilled to give the right answers at the right time to the education professional in front of them. Once outside the school gate, however, or when dealing with their families in their home environment, the reality is sometimes different.There needs to be a wider discussion of all the actors who deal with families and young people who are in difficulty and dealing with trauma, and to intervene at a much earlier stage. I also agree with the Minister when he says that teachers cannot do everything. They are asked to solve every single social ill in society. If there is an issue with sex education, it has to be the teachers who will teach about it. Driving was mentioned. With issues around mental health, smoking, drugs or teenage sex it is the teachers in schools who are told that they are ones who must deliver the message. There is, however, a wider societal involvement here, as the Minister will appreciate. Many schools cannot cope. They are dealing with situations where the children literally cannot cope with the situations they are in because of their background or because of something that has happened to them. What does a teacher in his or her 20s do when he or she has to deal with a child whose father has just been shot dead by the Garda? How can they deal with that situation? Consider a child who has a family member who has been killed in a gangland situation, or the child who has had a suicide in the family. It is very difficult to build a robust defence mechanism within that child in the classroom if one is not communicating with the parents, the wider community and wider society. There is no quick fix for this issue. I shall now turn to the issues of drugs and alcohol. In our schools we are failing to deliver a coherent message that might actually resonate with young people. This falls into the idea of well-being because it is what young people will turn to when trying to find some relief from the pain they feel. When one feels pain, one reaches for something. What will these children reach for? They might reach for alcohol or drugs. These young people say to me that they would believe what they hear in schools if it was not such a damned lie. They look around them, they look at their parents and their grandparents who all might have overdosed on drugs and alcohol - alcohol is a drug - and they see a society that is completely addicted to alcohol. However, they are the ones who are told to "just say "No"" and told of zero tolerance, etc. They do not believe this message. They certainly do not believe it when it comes to drugs either. We are going to have to have a much more honest connection with young people when it comes to our messaging around drug and alcohol use. Whatever message we have at the moment is not hitting home. There is a much more attractive message outside the school gates and a different message is potentially being given in the home. I am not sure if all those messages are connecting. With regard to the class size issue it is a fair point to make that we can deliver all the goodwill message we want, and teachers can have as much of a personal relationship with students under their care as they possibly can but if there are too many student, as a professional, the teacher or principal cannot cope. The Government, of which the Minister is a member, had an opportunity to reduce class sizes last year but it did not bother. Next week the Government will have an opportunity to change the situation, and I hope that it does, because schools cannot cope. My second point has already been alluded to and relates to how this issue might manifest itself in schools and how teachers feel valued within the system. Teachers are told they are valued, teachers are told they have to take on an expanded curriculum and they are told they must deliver the message to tackle social ills. However, within his own rhetoric the Minister cannot commit to the suggestion or ideal of equal pay for equal work. This is leading to a situation within staffrooms that is hurting. It leads to division and a lack of morale. I know from my own professional background that the fundamental responsibility of a school principal is to allow a teacher to teach. Fundamentally, the most important unit of the school is the teacher's relationship with his or her class. It is not the principal, not anybody else or any other actor who comes in and out of the class during the pupils' day. The fundamental purpose is to maximise the relationship between a teacher and his or her students. If teachers are told by the State that they are not worthy of having a pay level equal to the people they sit beside in the staffroom, it impacts on their self-esteem as professionals. I ask the Minister, again, to revisit his view on that. I shall recap on what I have said for the Minister because I feel it is important. I welcome the initiative. Well-being is something that starts way before the age of second level school. It is not just a school responsibility. It is a wider community responsibility and it is absolutely a fundamental parental role that needs to be addressed. We must talk about drugs and alcohol in a different way. Whatever message we are giving in school is not working. We must look at the issue of class size with regard to the effectiveness in delivering these messages. We also must look at the parity of esteem in classrooms and in staffrooms. My last point is from an article by Neil Gaiman in The Guardian that I read some years ago, which stuck with me. It was a piece about a private prison operator in the United States of America and how they assess the cells and prison space they would need for the capacity issues that would be required in 15 years' time. They determined that the best way of finding out how many spaces they would need in prisons in 15 years' time was to look at the literacy rates of ten year olds. There is an absolute correlation between illiteracy rates, a person's sense of well-being and sense of power, the opportunities a person has and a person's ability to succeed in this system we have created for young people. All of these things are intertwined. I believe that the Minister comes to this issue with the best of intentions. I believe that schools will openly welcome this initiative, as we always will, because schools always want what is best for their students. There are fundamental, underlying issues that we have in our system based on competition, the patronage model and the issues children have before they come anywhere near a school building. We cannot truncate all these issues into a single weekly class. I wish this initiative the best of luck, but I do it with the wish that the Minister would address the concerns I have raised today.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for Education and Skills for taking the time to be here in person. In another circumstance, I would picture the many crushing disappointments of yesterday's budget announcement but I will save that for another time and just speak about one issue involving Gaeltacht courses that primary teachers in training are expected to attend. I raise the issue because of a letter Deputy Jan O'Sullivan received from a constituent and passed on to me. I will give the Minister a flavour of what the student, whom I will not name, was saying. The student mentioned the cost of mandatory Gaeltacht courses incurred by primary school teachers and said that they sought Deputy O'Sullivan's support for a reinstatement of Government support for these courses in budget 2018. The student wrote that since 2012, due to cutbacks, students have had to pay for attending two courses in the Gaeltacht, each of two weeks' duration. The student wrote that although she believed it was necessary for students to attend these courses, the cost is around €1,400 per student, which she believed was too much for students to bear. She wrote that this does not include transport costs and living expenses. The student also makes the case that while they are two weeks away from home, teachers are missing out on the part-time job income they get during that time. She wrote that up until 2012, the cost of these courses was subsidised by the Government and that for an average student to save for one Gaeltacht placement now, they must work two eight-hour shifts every weekend for ten weeks and save all earnings.As a result they have no money left to pay for living expenses each week. The student asked that the matter be brought to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and requested that in budget 2018 he reinstate the subsidies for these courses, which would help to alleviate the burden of these expenses on students.  The Minister will probably elaborate on what has been done in budget 2018 to deal with this issue; however, I wish to make a further point. I think the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, also called in its pre-budget submission for a restoration of the grants for student teachers attending mandatory Gaeltacht courses. Nobody is suggesting the courses should be stopped in any way as they are very important for student teachers in brushing up on their Irish language competence. I was involved with the Marino Institute of Education in setting up a local initiative where students attending second level DEIS schools with an interest in becoming primary schoolteachers did grinds and received tuition after school in order to attain the standard required. I would be worried if disadvantaged students involved in teacher training had to fork out a significant amount of money at their own expense to go to the Gaeltacht. Now that we are in a better position in terms of the economic projections and that we have more money at our disposal, what the individual student and the USI are calling for is an opportunity to go back to where we were in 2012 for students attending Gaeltacht courses which I attended as a trainee primary schoolteacher and for the courses to be subsidised. If that has not happened in the budget, rather than turning it into a party-political point-scoring exercise, will the Minister examine the issue and restore the support in the coming year?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I find the Minister's reply disappointing. The announcement made by him yesterday was that the overall budget for the Department of Education and Skills was in the region of €9 billion. It would cost €1 million to resolve the issue I have outlined. We all know the background to it and I fully accept that we were in an economic crisis. We have all heard that 1,000 times, but we have also heard that the recovery is happening, that things are better now, that we have more money and that there are chances to repair the cutbacks and reductions that took place in recent years. That would be a reasonable expectation on the part of those in society who have endured huge pain. It appears that yesterday's budgetary announcement did not really do a huge amount for those studying at third level or training in various colleges. This is one such measure which would cost €1 million out of the €9 billion at the Minister's disposal. While I appreciate that he is not in a position to change the decisions made yesterday, I urge him to give some indication that he has a vision for the future - to paraphrase him - in rowing back on the difficult decisions made and that we can look forward to this type of measure being somewhere near the top of his priority list when trying to reverse the cutbacks introduced in the past.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise two issues. First, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss education. I am a little perturbed by yesterday's budget in terms of what it does for education. It is quite clear that many of the opportunities that were open to the Government were not taken. Clearly, the Minister has shown in the recent past that he has no interest in equality when it comes to teachers' pay. He also has no interest in free education, which is quite clear from the budget announcements that were made yesterday. There has been no effort to reduce the cost of going to school, no interest in raising the capitation that schools receive and no interest in alleviating the cost of going to college for students. I would appreciate an opportunity to have a conversation with the Minister on these matters. It is quite depressing that the new communications unit will receive €5 million. That amount of money would have done a huge amount to pay for schoolbook rental schemes in primary schools in this country. Second, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to debate the status of a Government document launched four years ago, entitled the Right to Read campaign. The campaign focuses on literacy and achieving literacy excellence in every local authority in the State. The document acknowledges the fact the library system, the housing stock and the environment in which children are raised have a huge influence over educational attainment. The document is called the Right to Read campaign because the State has acknowledged that every child has a right to read. I raise this matter because there is the possibility that a library in Donaghmede in my constituency will close in June 2019. I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government pays for half of the rental cost for the library currently and that when the lease ends such funding will no longer be available. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the status of this Government document that was launched in 2014. I want to know whether he still believes in the Right to Read campaign, if the State is still willing to fund local libraries and if he will ensure that the library in Donaghmede will not close due to a lack of funding from central government.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise the recent ballot taken by special needs assistants, SNAs, to take industrial action. Of SNAs who voted, 97% voted in favour of industrial action because of the ongoing uncertainty caused by late allocation made by the Department of Education and Skills. This is particularly irritating to the SNAs because an Oireachtas education committee report started by me and then completed and published by the former Senator Mary Moran outlined quite a number of issues that SNAs are raising. We had quite an extensive consultation with SNAs themselves about the work practices and the uncertainty they face. Once again, the Department has failed to deal with the issues raised in that report, and this late allocation issue still undermines the certainty that special needs assistants feel in the workplace. A number of teacher unions are not signing up to the most recent pay agreement, the Union of Students in Ireland is taking to the streets over the proposal for a student loan scheme and now, another branch of our education workforce is threatening industrial action. I therefore ask again for a debate on education matters in this House with the Minister at the earliest opportunity. Another issue I would like to raise, if I may, on a cheerier note is the push for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and in Australia, which, as was said to President Higgins on his visit there, is the most Irish country in the world outside of Ireland. A postal survey on this issue is taking place in Australia at present. The final date for posting of those ballots is, I believe, 27 October. In order to raise awareness of the ongoing push for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and in Australia, a football match will take place this Sunday in Tolka Park at 2 p.m. between politicians and Dublin Devils Football Club, a gay men's football team. It is open to all to come along and cheer on whichever team they wish to cheer on. It is a fund-raiser for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and will also raise awareness among Australian citizens in Ireland who wish to post their ballots back. As we still celebrate the fact that we in this Republic were the first country in the world to vote openly for marriage equality, we have an opportunity and an obligation to do what we can for other jurisdictions, other parts of this country and other countries in the world. We must encourage them to do what they can to bring in marriage equality where they are.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is very welcome. As previous speakers noted, all Senators acknowledge her commitment to the issue of child care and her achievements in this area in the Government's first two budgets. Previous Governments also made improvements in this area, for example, through the introduction of paid paternity leave, a measure in which I was involved. While we are in a better place than was previously the case, we are coming from a disgracefully low base in the area of child care. It is often said by Barnardos that we spend approximately €10,000 per annum on every primary school child, €12,000 per annum on every secondary school child, €16,000 per annum on every third level student and practically nothing on children of preschool age. People approach this debate from different vantage points but the political debate has always focused on the costs of child care to parents. It is as if this is simply a cost issue and the introduction of a tax credit would make matters easier. Other considerations, including the experience of the children and workers in the preschool setting, are sometimes lost. As we know, particularly in areas of disadvantage, the early years are crucial to a child's development. The terms "child care" and "preschool education" overlap and people can become confused or unclear about what they are talking about when it comes to child care and preschool education. The impact of early childhood care and education on brain development is significant and the capacity of children to learn during these years is immense. Furthermore, damage done to children in these years is often irreversible. When I speak in this Chamber or in other forums I often cite statistics showing that a poor three year old child will have about 400 words in his or her vocabulary, whereas a three year old from an advantaged or rich background will have about 1,200 words in his or her vocabulary. It is difficult to address this gap when the child attends primary school.  We have not come from this debate from the perspective of the child but instead focused on parental cost. This is understandable and it is an issue with which the Department is dealing. As previous speakers stated, the potential negative experience of a child is being compounded by the lack of morale in the system caused by conditions in child care workplaces, including poor pay, and job insecurity. It is difficult to maintain motivation in any workplace if one is at the bottom of the pecking order in terms of payscales, certainty of employment and all the other issues raised by other speakers.  It is great that representatives of SIPTU, the trade union behind the campaign on child care workers, are present. On the issue of the sectoral employment order, I understand the Minister and her officials are open to the proposed measure. I acknowledge, however, that this is not her call to make alone because Government-wide support will be required for such an order to be made. While I have great faith in the Minister's instincts, political values and ethics, many of us have questions as to whether those who surround her at the Cabinet table share her views on employment rights, workers' rights and equality in the workplace. As previous speakers noted, a gender equality issue arises because the vast majority of workers in the child care sector are female. This is vulnerable but crucial work. If one wants to damage a person in the long term, one should inflict the damage when he or she is aged under four years because it will be lasting. I am not in any way suggesting this is what is happening in the child care sector. However, if people are not properly paid and treated with respect, we should not be surprised if low morale seeps through the entire system. The House discussed special needs assistants in primary schools who work with the most vulnerable students in the system. These workers feel undermined and uncertain about their career prospects because the Department treats them as an add-on to the system, rather than a central part of it.  We need to focus on three elements, namely, what is best for parents and how we tackle the costs of child care for parents; what is best for the child and his or her development; and what is best for the child care worker. These three elements do not necessarily have to compete. If staff are highly motivated, well paid and trained, professional and respected, the children in their care will benefit, as will their families. I stand with previous speakers, SIPTU and child care workers on this issue. The sectoral employment order is the primary reason for my contribution to this debate, a view echoed by other speakers. If the Minister were to provide a commitment to introduce an employment order, this debate will have been worthwhile. In terms of what the Minister and her officials are trying to do, as she will be aware, the Seanad can often surprise us because once we get our teeth into an issue on which we all agree, Senators can be forceful in supporting a Minister. This could benefit the Minister as she continues to make improvements in this area. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As has been said, this weekend marks the fifth anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar. While I do not intend to deal with the eighth amendment here, as an Oireachtas committee is dealing with that issue, I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to ask Senator Mullen to apologise for his recent comments in the media relating to the death of Savita Halappanavar.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«May I ask-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With the greatest respect, this individual has insulted the name and the family of a dead woman. He did so deliberately and in a callous manner. He also did so with a veil of Christianity which, for me, is quite repugnant to anybody who holds the Christian faith in any type of respect. I suggest that a letter be sent from you, a Chathaoirligh, to Senator Mullen regarding his comments and that he be asked to apologise in the Chamber to the Halappanavar family for what he said. Perhaps we can get back to debating the eighth amendment in a respectful tone, which is what Members of this House should be doing and not insulting a dead woman, particularly in the week of her anniversary.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Um thráthnóna ba mhaith liom i dtús báire tacú leis an méid atá ráite leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar bhás na Gaeltachtaí. Bhí cruinniú agam le baill de Chonradh na Gaeilge le gairid agus bhí an tuairim céanna acu. Bhí siad ag rá ní hamhain go bhfuil fadhb ann sna Gaeltachtaí, ach go bhfuil siad i mbaol báis. Caithfimid bheith níos réabhlóidí má táimid ag iarraidh na Gaeltachtaí a choinneáil agus a shábháil. Tá Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag iarraidh straitéis nua a chur le chéile, ionas go mbeimid i bhfad níos réabhlóidí ó thaobh ár bpolasaí Gaeilge de. Ó thaobh oideachais de, theip go mór orainn mar thír. Is féidir pointí a scóráil ó thaobh páirtí polaitiúla de, ach mar thír agus mar Stát, theip orainn ó thaobh múineadh na Gaeilge agus foghlaim na Gaeilge ó bhunú an Stáit go dtí an lá inniu. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir linn ár méaracha a shíneadh i dtreo aon áit eile ar fud an domhain agus tír a aimsiú ina gcaitheann páistí níos mó na deich mbliana ag foghlaim teanga agus nach bhfuil siad in ann an teanga sin a labhairt go flúirseach nó go líofa. Tá sé dochreidte. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-chuid anailíse déanta ar an gceist seo. Cén fáth nach bhfuil páistí in ann an teanga seo a úsáid? An easpa spéise atá i gceist? An bhfuil fadhb ann le heaspa suime ag tuismitheoirí? Tá sé deacair a rá cén fáth go bhfuil sé mar sin ach tá sé mar sin. Is iar-bhunmhúinteoir mé féin. Ó thaobh chúrsaí oideachais de, b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn rud éigin i bhfad níos réabhlóidí a dhéanamh inár mbunscoileanna. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn, in achan bunscoile atá againn sa tír, bliain amháin nó dhá bhliain a mhúineadh go huile agus go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge. Ní bheadh an Ghaeilge againn mar ábhar inár scoileanna, ach mar theanga. Ní féidir, i mo thuairimse, Gaeilge a mhúineadh mar ábhar. Ní raibh Gaeilge ar bith agamsa go dtí gur fhreastal mé ar Ghaelscoil sa séú rang. Bhí an meon céanna agam mar ghasúr nuair a bhí mé 12 bliain d'aois. Bhí grá agam don teanga ach ní raibh focal dá laghad agam. Bhí mé tar éis deich mbliana á chaitheamh ag foghlaim na teanga, ach go dtí go raibh an Ghaeilge á húsáid agam sa rang, sa chlós, le mo chairde agus sna hábhair eile go léir, níor fhoghlaim mé mo chuid Gaeilge. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh mar ábhar. Caithfear an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh mar theanga. Tar éis deich mbliana ní chainteoir dúchais mé féin ar chor ar bith, ach sílim, ag an staid seo, go bhfuil orainn bheith réabhlóideach faoin rud seo agus - ní maith liom an téarma iachall a úsáid - ach go mbeadh ar gach aon pháiste bhunscoile bliain amháin a chaitheamh sa bhunscoil céanna ag foghlaim chuile rud trí Ghaeilge.Ar a laghad, bheadh cumas i bhfad níos fearr acu sa teanga ná mar atá acu anois. B'fhéidir go b'fhéadfaimis staidéar a dhéanamh ar sin. I also wish to go beyond the Irish language community in respect of the training of teachers. I think the Irish language has, unfortunately, become a barrier to many people who wish to pursue a career in primary school teaching. There is evidence to suggest that people from disadvantaged areas, the Traveller community, and migrants view the Irish language as being an unreasonable barrier to their entry into the training colleges. Nobody is suggesting that the Irish language requirement for teaching should be lessened. The standard of Irish one has when leaving a teaching college should be excellent. The suggestion that applicants should have a high standard of Irish on entering teacher training, however, should be challenged. In my own constituency on the northside, I, the Northside Partnership and the Marino Institute of Education are providing Irish language tuition for students who are attending second level DEIS schools in which higher level Irish is not available. These students cannot even get the qualification because of the school they attend. We are losing out on generations of excellent primary school teachers, who would be fantastic role models, because of the communities they come from, because of their ethnic backgrounds or because they come from the Traveller community. We need to examine that. The standard of Irish one has on leaving teacher training is more important than the standard of Irish one has on entering. I suggest to the Minister of State that he come to the Marino Institute of Education and see those young people and what they are trying to do. They are trying to get extra tuition in the Irish language to get into teacher training. The Irish language is a barrier for them and is not something they are necessarily positive towards because it is seen to be an unreasonable expectation of them at this stage, even though they would obviously love to be in a position to teach it to a high standard if and when they become primary school teachers. Mar fhocal scoir, cuireann sé sórt leadráin orm nuair a chloisim polaiteoirí ó pháirtithe éagsúla ag cáineadh a chéile mar gheall ar an méid a rinne siad nó an méid íseal airgid a chuir siad ar fáil don Ghaeilge. Theip orainn mar shochaí, mar Stát agus mar mhórphobal ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Ní féidir linn a rá go bhfuil an milleáin ar aon pháirtí nó Rialtas faoi leith. B'fhéidir go gcaithfimid teacht le chéile agus a aontú go bhfuil an teanga níos tábhachtaí ná cúrsaí polaitíochta. Sílim féin go bhfuil. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé thar am dúinn bheith i bhfad níos réabhlóidí faoi na leigheasanna atá de dhíth i láthair na huaire.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to raise two items. I want to raise the issue of the necessity for a second Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, survey. This survey would cost in the region of €1 million. Given the various different court cases that have come to public attention over the recent weeks, and the issue of sexual assault and sexual violence in Ireland has been heavily debated, it is appalling that the Government can find €5 million for a communications unit but cannot find €1 million to undertake this study. I would ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality in here to discuss the issue of sexual violence and assault in Ireland and to justify to this House why €5 million on getting the Government's message out is worthwhile but €1 million to discover ways that we can tackle sexual assault and violence in Ireland is not. I also want to raise the issue of the tracker mortgage situation. I want the Leader and this House to understand how serious this issue is for social cohesion in Ireland. There are young people and not so young people in disadvantaged communities around this country who are always on the wrong end of the law for minor infractions, be it shoplifting or public order offences. The book is thrown at them, left, right and centre if they get on the wrong side of the law, and they are looking at this situation in terms of the tracker mortgage scenario. I am sure they are wondering to themselves why bankers always seem to get more time and understanding, and that fundamentally, when it comes down to it we as a political collective do not seem to come to the conclusion that we are basically dealing with a mafia type mindset, an amoral group with no conscience who treat everything and everybody as secondary to their fundamental motive of screwing people until they can get enough money out of them. All they care about is profit and money but they will say the right things and they will do the right things in committees and come to meetings with Ministers. How can one look a young person in the face who is facing a court hearing or interacting with a juvenile liaison officer over some shoplifting or some public order offence? Everything is thrown at that young person, basically because he or she is poor, but this shower of bastards are getting away with murder, year in, year out, in this democracy.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have been through a complete collapse-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----which was caused mainly by their actions. We are now in a situation where things have been proven. I am glad Members in this House find it so amusing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are now looking at at least 30,000 cases in terms of tracker mortgage issues. We are also looking at people who have lost their homes and still the Government will say we can give the banks more time.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am trying to make the point - I am glad Senators find it so amusing-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----that young people and communities in socially disadvantaged situations view this matter quite starkly. When they are at the rough end of the law they get the book thrown at them but when the Government is dealing with banks, the banks get more time.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach will afford me the same courtesy of-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would never abuse the privilege of this House. It may have come to some people's notice that it is a year today since the election of Donald Trump. His anti-immigrant, anti-refugee and anti-asylum seeker rhetoric has gone around the world since then. Given that we listened closely to the Brexit debate and have witnessed what has happened across Europe where the Austrian Parliament is, unfortunately, welcoming people of a very right-wing persuasion and where the people almost elected a far-right President, and where one third of the electorate in France voted for a representative of the National Front, we can see that far-right, anti-immigrant rhetoric and sentiment are rife across Europe and in the US. Given our history, this country has a responsibility to stand for something better and more profound and decent. This is exactly what this Bill is.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The instinctive nastiness of the Taoiseach's politics has been laid bare over the past 48 hours and the Government sank to new depths when issuing rhetoric around the homelessness crisis. I think every Member of the House would agree that homelessness is the biggest issue this country must face. When dealing with a serious issue, one would assume no Minister or Government would engage in victim blaming. However, over the weekend and this week, we have had the suggestion that our homelessness levels are normal, last night it was suggested that talking about homelessness is bad for our international reputation, and now we have the deplorable suggestion that homelessness is down to the bad behaviour of those who are homeless. This is the inevitable consequence of the nasty rhetoric of defending those who get up early in the morning and saying that, for those who are vulnerable, it is in a way their own fault at the end of the day. It is outrageous. Rather than having a Government which holds its hands up and states it is doing its best but that it is a difficult and complex problem on which it will work harder and better to find solutions, we are told that our homelessness rates are normal if one considers the international comparators and that we might have a better international reputation if we stopped talking about it. Inevitably, other people working in the sector are saying that it is their own fault at the end of the day. The rhetoric from the communications unit is outrageous. What is worse about the unit is that €5 million is nothing compared to the price of demonising the most vulnerable people in this country of ours. I genuinely do not want this to turn into party political football.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«However, this is the inevitable consequence. I am blue in the face from listening to demands in this Chamber for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come in here. It is a waste of all our time.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We need the Taoiseach in here to account for his comments and to tell us his vision for ending homeless. It is outrageous that we have two members-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hold on. This is the party that gives the rest of us lectures about social issues and Christianity.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This morning two members of the Catholic church were on the radio. Brother Crowley and Fr. Peter McVerry are appalled at the rhetoric of this Government. It is disgusting that we are now blaming the homeless for homelessness. It is unbelievable. I am asking the Cathaoirleach and the Leader quite respectfully-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Most of us have been reasonably calm up to this point. However, we are now being told that giving tents and food to the homeless on the side of the street is wrong, that it is their bad behaviour that is causing the problem and that we should stop talking about it because it is bad for our international reputation. It is beyond time we had the Taoiseach in here to answer for his nasty rhetoric and get back to the substance of the issue and stop blaming those who are the victims of it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sorry but the homeless are the ones that are being pointed at and being blamed.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it my bad behaviour now? Am I behaving badly?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Nobody really enjoys this type of event. We do this because we are dealing with a very serious issue and because there are very serious issues in this country. We have the highest number of people sleeping rough on record, a health crisis, issues in education and Brexit. We do these things because we need to know that the second most important politician in the land is up to the job. The Tánaiste is a senior Minister at Cabinet and was previously the Minister for Justice and Equality. We need to be very careful to split the personal from the political. The Tánaiste came to the Department of Justice and Equality shortly before I did - as her Minister of State - when it was completely reeling following the resignation of the previous Minister associated with this issue, the resignation - we will say he resigned - of the previous Garda Commissioner and the resignation of the Secretary General of the Department.The Toland report is damning on the culture in the Department of Justice and Equality. Notwithstanding all of the issues I referenced earlier, there is no greater political controversy than the ongoing issue of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his treatment. In her opening statement, the Tánaiste referenced her great achievements in the Department of Justice and Equality, which is fair enough. I would contend, however, that the Labour Party had huge influence in the justice area in terms of the whistleblower legislation, the establishment of the Policing Authority and the freedom of information legislation. Notwithstanding all that is stated in the Toland report in regard to the Department of Justice and Equality, including that it has a silo culture, and all of the resignations outlined, the Tánaiste's best defence in regard to the email in question is that it was not stated therein that she was required to do anything. Given the culture of the Department of Justice and Equality, one wonders who was running the show.  The Department of Justice and Equality is an interesting animal. It is located in a building which has reinforced bullet-proof windows. Those who work there walk with a certain swagger and consider themselves to be very important. The Department has a huge budget and it deals with issues of security and law and order. The vast bulk of legislation that goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas comes from the Department of Justice and Equality. Those who work there take themselves quite seriously. When one is in a ministerial role in that Department one has to be aware of their reputation. The Tánaiste would have been aware of this reputation because she read the Toland report. It was given to her soon after her appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality and so she knew the reputation of the Department staff. The Tánaiste received an email and her reaction was that she did not need to take any action. That is pretty damning. We are governed by the political entity that is Fine Gael and a number of Independents, which I do not believe has the capacity to deal with the serious issues we face. On three separate occasions this week the Department of Justice and Equality has provided information to the Taoiseach which required him to correct the record of the Dáil. It is important not to mix the personal with the political in this matter. I feel sorry for the Fine Gael Members because I was that soldier. When Minister of State, I had to read speeches confirming confidence in the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and various other Ministers who were in trouble. When Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in government and a Fine Gael Minister was in trouble, Labour Party backbenchers' phones would be ringing off the hook but when a Labour Party Minister was in trouble Labour Party backbencher'' phones were off the hook. It is remarkable that the Independent Alliance Ministers are not on record supporting the Tánaiste. I would be interested to know, beyond the spokesperson from the Independent Alliance, where they stand on this matter.  The Department of Justice and Equality has had oversight of huge change in the justice area. It brought down two Garda Commissioners and a former Minister for Justice and Equality. It could be said that it effectively led to the Taoiseach being toppled. The Tánaiste's best response in regard to the email she received is that she was told it was no big deal. Given the seriousness of the situation surrounding Sergeant Maurice McCabe this indicates either a lack of interest or competence to deal with the most serious political issue of our day. The response of the Tánaiste, as the second most senior politician in this land, leaves a huge amount to be desired.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise two issues. The first relates to the Tánaiste's contribution to the Seanad last night. I believe it is time we invited the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to the House. His Department seems to be completely incapable of giving factual information to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach will have to correct the record of the House for a third time because of information that was given to him by the Department of Justice and Equality. It also appears that an email that was discovered, which was the centre of the controversy, was not communicated to the Tánaiste for a full week. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, made a bizarre outburst in the Dáil last week when he accused my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, of conducting a smear campaign against him. As we are trying to get the bottom of this situation, all the while remembering that Sergeant Maurice McCabe is the person we should be most concerned about in terms of a smear campaign, I respectfully ask again that the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, be invited to this House to account for his Department's handling of the current situation. I ask for a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who currently has responsibility for the national drugs strategy. When the new strategy was launched in July, a commitment was given that a 12-month working group would be established on the issue of the decriminalisation of drug use. That was a welcome development, and as the Leader and the Members of the Seanad will know, myself and Senator Lynne Ruane have drafted a piece of legislation which would give effect to the decriminalisation of addiction and drug use. We were willing to go with the new strategy and to give it the time and space it needed to bed itself down although we did not necessarily believe in having a separate strategy towards the end goal of decriminalisation of drug use. It is now November, almost December, however, and there is no sign of this working group being established. I respectfully ask that we invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to the House to discuss the establishment of the working group on the decriminalisation of drug use. It is a very serious issue. I believe there is broad agreement around the House as to how we could look at this issue, and there is great humanity in this House when it comes to the issue of drug use and addiction. We are determined that this working group will be set up, that it will do its work efficiently, and that at the end of a 12 month period it will come to conclusions that would hopefully lead us to adopt a drugs strategy such as that in existence in Portugal. However, four months on, we are no closer to having that working group established. I would like the Minister of State to come in so that we can work with her to ensure that we get that working group established and to work for those in our country who are suffering from the effects of addiction.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will give the Leader a YouTube moment if he wants one.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Who wrote the email?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Who wrote it?

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is Frankfurt's way.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Can the Leader confirm that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will address the House on the current controversy?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State to the House. While it is a worthwhile report, I feel the issues in it tinker around the edges. The last time the Minister of State was in this Chamber, we had a long discussion about third level funding and about income-contingent loan schemes or the potential for their introduction. She made the point that she was waiting for the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to come up with proposals to react to the Cassells report. Once the committee did its work the Minister of State said she would react to it. I do not think that washes anymore as a political answer. It is time for the Minister of State and her Department to take leadership in this area. I am still exasperated at the her ministerial colleague in the same Department, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who still will not state he believes in equality in education in terms of pay and will not commit to the vision of free education. The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, has launched a campaign and the Labour Party has launched a campaign to have a vision for free education at all levels, namely, primary, secondary and third level. The Minister of State's response to our debate was that the Joint Committee on Education and Skills should be allowed to do its work and then to come back to her. That is not good enough. The Joint Committee on Education and Skills is not in charge of education policy in the country. The Minister of State and her Department are. She should be driving the agenda, not the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. If the committee has not got down to doing the work, is not conducting hearings and is nowhere near producing a report on it, the Minister of State must step in as the visionary for higher level education in this country. Hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, regardless of the standard of contributor to that committee, is just not good enough. We need from the Minister of State a strong commitment to a vision for free education. No one suggests this can happen overnight, in one budget or even in a number of budgets. It might be possible over five years or perhaps over ten years. However, were that vision to be announced by the Minister of State and her ministerial colleague in the same Department, we might be able to work together to achieve it. Until this point, however, the Minister of State has been hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and saying it is up to it to come up with proposals. It is not; it is actually up to the Minister, her ministerial colleague and their Department to set out that vision as to how third level education should be funded and to set out the vision for free education. That is something I believe we should all be able to share and work towards with the Minister. My final point is when we were in government with Fine Gael, one of the biggest rows we had was over the issue of grants for third level. The contention of the Labour Party is that PAYE workers are constantly taking up the tab for others who find access to third level grants, be they maintenance grants or other grants, because of the magic wand of accountants that certain self-employed professions are able to employ. I recall an example of one individual who had €250,000 in a savings account but was still eligible for a full suite of grants for his children to attend third level education. A PAYE worker would not be able to do that. These matters are assessed on need but the suggestion that we would have any kind of a capital assets test, in whatever way, was hugely resisted by the Minister's own party in government and we did not get very far on introducing that. In a system where approximately 45% to 50% of students are availing of some level of grants and it costs approximately €300 million a year to administer these grants, I would have assumed that the most vulnerable of students would be the ones who would avail of these grants and not those who have accountants who can move the money around. Unfortunately, that remains the case. I have two questions for the Minister of State. Does she believe in free education and will she stop hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in order that she can verbalise that vision and work towards it? What is the position in respect of the capital asset test and can we look forward to a day when PAYE workers will not always be asked to pick up the tab for those who can avail of accountants who can hide assets and therefore get the grants they do not deserve?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise two issues. The first is the necessity to have a debate here with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan. This time last week we on this side of the House were accused of all sorts of things relating to the former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. We were accused of skullduggery and there were all sorts of pantomime moves when we asked for accountability. In fairness to the Minister, she came into the House and we had a debate. We are respectfully asking for a debate with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on the actions he has taken as Minister and on Garda overtime. In Dublin city, where I live, we had a very successful Garda operation recently when gardaí intercepted what appears to have been a shooting about to take place and they seized some firearms. The second most senior garda in the city is suggesting that the reopening of Stepaside Garda station is well down his list of priorities and now we hear that Garda overtime has been cancelled for the foreseeable future, which means the situation as regards law and order and policing is quite stark, so a debate with the Minister is warranted. I also want to raise the issue of homelessness, though I know it has been raised before. In recent days, many people watching the political goings-on would not have been too impressed by how the Oireachtas was brought to the edge of disaster, with a Christmas election threatened. Two homeless people have died in Dublin in the past week and I believe the total is seven over the past 12 weeks. The people would want their politicians to engage on this issue with the same level of seriousness as we engaged in the issue relating to the former Minister and Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the emails in the Department of Justice. People are literally dying on our streets and I respectfully ask that we come together to have a discussion with the Minister for Housing on the issue of homelessness. We would not need to be party-political on the issue but we need to treat it with the seriousness it deserves. The people of Ireland would expect all Members of the Oireachtas to take it as seriously as, if not more seriously than, the issue which convulsed the Houses in recent days.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his strong statement to the US Embassy in Dublin regarding the proposed move of the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. President Trump made what amounts to a classic feckless and irresponsible statement and the Tánaiste is to be congratulated on the swiftness of his response to the suggested recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I understand that the Tánaiste is extremely busy at the moment but perhaps he might to come the House at the earliest opportunity in the new year to discuss Ireland's position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how we can be of support to him in his ongoing efforts. As Christmas approaches, Dublin city centre gets very busy and traffic becomes a major issue. I wish to raise the issue of rickshaws. We are reaching a stage where we must consider banning these vehicles. They are causing untold potential danger to pedestrians, motorists, shoppers and revellers in Dublin city centre. They are completely unregulated. A report in the Irish Independent this time last year suggested that there was a level of drug dealing and drug transportation involving rickshaws. I respectfully ask the Leader to facilitate a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport as to how we can either regulate rickshaws or ban them outright because it is reaching a stage where we are only waiting for a serious accident to take place in Dublin city centre. I am quite sure that the situation is similar in other cities throughout the country. I ask that the Minister come to the House to deal with this issue, once and for all.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to raise two issues this afternoon. I wish to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House to address an issue which I think most Members would agree is a major problem in Irish society. It is not a new problem, but in the last number of weeks, as has been alluded to already, it has become prominent. I refer to the area of gun crime. Very close to where I live, there was an interception of a gang apparently on the way to commit a murder. Intercepting that person was great work by the Garda. A garda was shot in the line of duty only days ago, and then, shockingly, this week we have heard reports of a baby being caught in the crossfire. Too often in society, when there is a gun crime or a shooting, it is dismissed as gangland. Sometimes people will even say that as long as gangs are doing it to each other, it does not affect them. We cannot really live in a society that would stand over such comments as that. This week it is quite clear that gardaí are putting their bodies on the line and even infants often get caught in the crossfire. It is time to have a national debate on gun crime, how it is affecting our society and how children are being desensitised to it. It is particularly disturbing, I would suggest, that any child would grow up anywhere in Ireland and hear that there has been a murder overnight in their area. It is not good enough, it is not normal, it is not right, and we should never ever consider it to be normal. It would befit this House to have such a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality and allow him to outline his attempts to tackle this very serious issue.Unfortunately, there is a certain amount of empowerment that comes with handling a firearm and young people are often attracted to that way of life. We need to understand the reasons behind that and tackle them. Related to that, I would like to have another debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the wide-ranging issue of educational disadvantage. We had some positive statistics last week on the rate of literacy among children in Ireland. Much credit has to go to successive Ministers in that regard. For our part in the Labour Party, in the previous Government we placed a huge emphasis on literacy and it is good to see the Government is continuing that good work. All those efforts are to be commended, but there are many overlapping reasons educational disadvantage is still an issue. We still have one child in three leaving the DEIS primary schools with basic reading problems. We have a 17.9% functional illiteracy rate among adults in the country. It is an issue of power that we need to address. There are many facets to this issue of educational disadvantage. It needs to be tackled from pregnancy to infancy, to early school years and beyond. It is something that should be addressed, if possible, in a wide-ranging debate. If the Leader could facilitate that debate, it would be of great benefit to see how we can empower all citizens to seek a life for themselves in mainstream society through education and not to turn to other areas of empowerment which, unfortunately, we have seen cause such devastation to families and to members of the Garda Síochána this week.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a relief.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to the Chamber. I was shocked last week when a parent described how one of her children who has autism has not been in receipt of speech therapy since September. A principal in the locality told me that the reality on the ground is that unless a parent or a family is willing to set aside the time to scream and shout at the top of their lungs, they will not get the requisite attention from the education and health systems that their children deserve. She made the point that given that sometimes families can be collapsing trying to meet the needs of their children, to expect them to campaign as well for the assistance they so greatly need is completely unrealistic, unnecessary and unfair. We seem to have a system held together with straw. We still have an issue with maternity leave not being covered. Speech therapy is a patchwork of a service in the area that I am most familiar with on the north side of Dublin. I can only imagine what it is like around the country. What words of comfort would the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, have for the mother who spoke to me about her child, who has autism, and who has not been able to access speech therapy for her son since September?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I appreciate the detailed nature of his reply and his acceptance that it is not good enough that six children have waited for more than 12 months for an assessment. Does he concede, notwithstanding the investment that is clearly being made, that there is still a level of desperation being felt on the ground? Does he concede that there is not the connectivity between his words and the reality experienced by school principals, teachers and parents in certain parts of this city? Parents need to be in their homes to help their children through their formative years, which can be a difficult period so the last thing parents need to be are campaigners. Can he assure us that any parent whose child is in need of speech therapy will not have to wait for months for therapy to be resumed? Does he accept that a situation where maternity leave breaks that service is unacceptable?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Leader for a debate on GP care. I have received correspondence from Sutton, in my own part of the world, indicating that a GP there is now charging between €20 and €30 for blood tests. I also note the comments of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, suggesting that GP visits for children could cost between €5 and €10, which is a row back of the scheme brought in by the last Government. Even though GP care for children up to 12 years of age was provided for in the budget before the most recent general election, it has not happened yet. My worry is that free GP care is not being expanded and rolled out further. Instead, it is being curtailed, and individual GPs are making their own decisions as to how much they will charge for something as simple as a blood test. I understand that this particular GP is also encouraging people to go to Beaumont Hospital rather than provide the blood test in his own surgery. I would very much appreciate a debate on free GP care in this House. To the people of the great state of Alabama, I send congratulations from this House. They have managed to defeat one racist and homophobic sex offender and I hope the other racist, homophobic sex offender in the White House will soon have a similar fate.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Having taken on board the comments of Senator Reilly and the Cathaoirleach, I accept that it is not appropriate for a Member of this House to make the comments that I made in terms of labelling someone as a sex offender without due process. I want to withdraw my remarks and apologise for them.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:“That Seanad Éireann:- recognises the vital role that special needs assistants (SNAs) play in Ireland's education system, providing essential support for some of the most vulnerable students in our classrooms;- acknowledges the overwhelming vote in October 2017 by over 8,000 SNAs as members of IMPACT in favour of industrial action;- regrets the failure of the Minister for Education and Skills to implement the recommendations of the Oireachtas education committee report on the role of the special needs assistants published in January 2016;- condemns the July publication of SNA allocations in 2017, which caused enormous uncertainty for SNAs;- demands that the Minister for Education and Skills guarantee that:- in future, SNA allocations will be announced in sufficient time (no later than May) to allow the supplementary assignment panel – and distribution of available hours to serving staff – operate to full effect;- arrangements will be put in place in respect of job security for SNAs;- an agreed procedure will be established for dealing with SNA grievances and issues.”I welcome the Minister to the House. On behalf of the Labour Party group, I am delighted to propose this motion in defence of the employment rights of special needs assistants. Before I do so, I acknowledge the attendance in the Visitors Gallery of members of IMPACT and some of the special needs assistants it represents very ably and with distinction. It might not be well known to many Members of this House - in fact, it might not be well known to many members of the Irish public in general - that IMPACT has balloted for industrial action out of complete frustration with the actions, or inaction, of the Department of Education and Skills. Most people would agree that when a profession such as that of special needs assistants is forced to ballot for industrial action, something has gone seriously wrong. SNAs are dedicated to the welfare of the students they work with. Anyone who has ever come across an SNA in any school in Ireland knows that this is their primary concern. When it comes to a situation where the union that represents over 8,000 SNAs feels it has to ballot for industrial action, and when 97% of those SNAs agree that industrial action is the route they feel it is necessary to pursue, then something is seriously wrong. I have some history with this issue, as do many in the Labour Party. I initiated an Oireachtas committee report on the role of the SNA in the last Oireachtas and this was completed by the then Senator Mary Moran and published in January 2016. I recall a number of years ago having a public meeting in my constituency on the issue and that meeting was stuffed out the door with people willing to tell their stories. What always comes back, and it happened again this afternoon at our briefing for all Members of the Oireachtas, whom I want to thank for attending to hear the story of SNAs, is that it is never, ever about money. Fundamentally, what SNAs are asking for is respect. We could spend hours talking about the respect or disrespect that SNAs are shown within the walls of the schools in which they work. Any SNA will tell stories they have heard or witnessed about menial tasks they have been asked to undertake, about the fact they are referred to by their first name while every other adult in the school is referred to by their second name and about the basic lack of value placed on them as professionals in an educational setting. However, we are not here to talk about that issue. We are also not here to talk about the number of SNAs in the system, which obviously was increased under the last Government and again under the Government. While that is to be welcomed, it is not the point. The point is the way that SNAs are treated by the Department of Education and Skills.Fundamentally, it comes down to the timing of the allocations. I know last week and earlier this month, it was relayed to IMPACT that that situation would change and that the allocations would be known from May next year so that SNAs can plan for September in future. That is to be welcomed but it is very late in the game for SNAs to know that and it is disappointing that they had to ballot for industrial action before they got such clarification from the Minister's Department. There is still a huge number of issues with the situation with special needs assistants. The Minister mentioned in his counter-motion that a review is being undertaken by the National Council for Special Education relating to the role of an SNA. IMPACT informed us this afternoon that it has no role, involvement or engagement in that review. It is staggering that, if the Department is to pretend that the SNA is respected, the body that represents the vast bulk of SNAs has no involvement in this review. The Minister can suggest to me that that is not the case. If it is not the case, why would senior members of IMPACT state it so categorically in an open forum this afternoon? Points were raised this afternoon which really shocked me and I thought I knew this issue inside out. The issues include SNAs at second level being asked to be on-site doing fundamentally menial tasks in June. Gardening and painting were mentioned. Just being asked to be on-site for the month of June was mentioned. That is something that anybody would find reprehensible from an employment rights perspective. They have no board of management representation. Everybody else in an educational setting has representation on the board of management. The parents and patron would have representation on the board of management but not the special needs assistants. They have no involvement with the care plan for individual students. When a care plan is put together by the school for the students who are under the care of an SNA assigned to help them during the day, the SNA is not involved in that care plan. It comes back again and again to the issue of respect. I know the Minister will not want to micromanage every school and the way every school or school principal deals with an SNA or group of SNAs in the school but leadership in education comes from the top. I suggest that leadership is sorely lacking. Another issue, which it might be suggested is small, that comes down to basic respect is the matter of bereavement leave. If one is a teacher, bereavement leave is five days whereas it is three days for an SNA. All these small things add up to SNAs believing that they are not respected, do not have security of work and cannot plan for the future or look forward to September with some kind of security of tenure. Until now, SNAs have not known if they would be back in a school in September; they wondered if they should apply for another job and considered that perhaps they should not because they might retain original positions. There is insecurity related to bills, mortgage repayments etc. that everyone has to pay. We ask the Minister to change the attitude that the Department has to special needs assistants, to acknowledge them as a vital component of our education system, to acknowledge that the special needs assistants we have, approaching 14,000, are vital in the roles that they have. They are not an add-on to the system. They are not a luxury. They need to be clearly defined. They need to be given the respect and value that they deserve at this stage. It is only fitting that the report compiled by former Senator Mary Moran would be at the top of any review mechanism that is in place.  We have a few fundamental questions. I know it is the way of things to table a counter-motion and that the Minister has spoken in his counter-motion about the number of SNAs who have been allocated and that is fine and to be welcomed. However, the employment rights and the value placed on individual SNAs is what we are speaking about today. It does not come down to the salary expectation that any SNA has. Whenever any of my Labour Party colleagues or I have a discussion with special needs assistants, money is never raised. It is always about the respect they are given from within the school and from the Department. We ask the Minister to expand on what he has said in his counter-motion with regard to the review. Will he engage with the practitioners and representatives in compiling that review? I find it incredibly frustrating when dealing with the Department that there always seems to be a review, committee or paper written by somebody else and the Department seems unwilling or unable to make a definite decision outside of having another body compile a report. There are many issues in the area of education on which we in the Labour Party group believe the Government is falling down. We have the ongoing issue of pay discrimination among primary and second level teachers which was raised again with me today. Noises from the Government are not helping with it. I received a phone call today from Councillor Mark Wall in Kildare about St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin and its lack of certainty as to the progress of its school building. There are many issues with education coming down the tracks. We get action plan after action plan after action plan from the Department, yet the very good work which was compiled by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills seems to have been sitting on a shelf for almost two years. There is inaction when it comes to a cross-party, bipartisan approach to the future of the SNA. Let us get beyond the numbers of SNAs allocated by the Minister's Department because that has been acknowledged. We want to deal with the issue of respect, ensure we value special needs assistants and engage with them and their representatives in any review the Minister undertakes. We will call a vote on our motion. We are sticking with it as laid down. We reject the counter-motion and we want support for our motion from all corners of this House.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank all the Members who have spoken, particularly those who have spoken in support of the motion, Senator Robbie Gallagher from Fianna Fáil, Senator Máire Devine from Sinn Féin, Senator Grace O'Sullivan from the Green Party and the Civil Engagement group and my own colleagues, Senators Nash, Bacik and Humphreys who have laid out the reason this issue is so important. I wish to pay tribute in particular to the IMPACT trade union, representatives of which are in the Visitors Gallery. If any SNA is listening to this debate in any part of the country is not a member of a trade union, today is a good example as to why they need to join a trade union. Without the activity of IMPACT, in mobilising their members, this debate would not be happening and the Minister for Education and Skills would not be here to respond to the issues that have been raised. I thank the members of IMPACT for being present in the Visitors Gallery, for promoting the interests of special needs assistants and for continuing to do so. I take issue with some of the comments made by Government speakers. To suggest some level of surprise that an SNA has been given a menial task to undertake in a school is, as anybody who knows anything about special needs assistants, completely disconnected with the reality of what is happening in Irish primary and secondary schools. If that is a surprise to anybody, they do not know fundamentally what they are talking about. I suggest that it would be significant surprise to IMPACT to learn that it is being consulted in regard to this review because if so, it was not aware of it as late as 2 p.m. I am sure it will be surprised to learn that it is part of the consultation for this review, which we believe from the amendment to the motion will report back in March 2018.I am delighted to hear there is a SNA on the review group but that is not good enough. That is not a comprehensive review of the role of the SNA. If one is excluding members of the trade union which represents the SNAs from being on this review group or even in consulting with it in a meaningful way, I think the review is doomed to fail. However, we will give it a fair chance to report to the House. We will obviously be in the Chamber to discuss the group's report. I think everybody in this House fundamentally knows the value of the special needs assistant. SNAs do not ask for much. They do the most incredible of jobs, they empower the most vulnerable of children in our system, they give them a reason to smile and they look forward to seeing them every day. They make a connection with them on a human level, which is unparalleled. Without them many families would not be able to cope. They give the child a reason to go to school and to look forward to it. They build relationships that often last long after the child has left second level education. They are not asking for even a fraction of the world, they are not even asking for a single penny in extra salary, all they are asking for is respect and for their role to be valued. That is why so many Members of this House from different political backgrounds have looked at the motion and realised it is not a political football. We are not trying to have a go at anybody or have a political points scoring exercise. We are trying to defend the employment rights of SNAs with a trade union such as IMPACT. That is the reason that speakers from Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Civil Engagement group have seen the validity of our motion and rejected the Government counter-motion. I am quite sure that when the votes are cast, it will become a Seanad Éireann motion that shows the SNAs of this country that this House respects them. The IMPACT trade union and other trade unions that work with SNAs are working tirelessly on their behalf. It will be a good day for them to realise that the political system is backing them, that their union backs them and this House backs them. What they want from the Minister for Education and Skills is that he will back them too.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join everybody else in wishing staff and Members a happy Christmas and others in wishing the Leader all the best for his wedding. I was in a school this morning, Pobalscoil Neasáin in Baldoyle. It is interesting that we had a short discussion about the sexual orientation of various different political leaders and it was of absolutely no interest to them. It was wonderful in the presence of young people that such issues were of no interest.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I remarked to them that when I was a child it would have been almost impossible but now, thanks to the leadership of people like Senator Buttimer, my own colleague, former Deputy John Lyons, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, the Taoiseach and so many others, we can stand in the House like this and wish our good friend and colleague all the best and it is no big deal. I will raise two issues quickly.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In regard to the trade union rights issue, we had a good day here yesterday in terms of having a motion on SNA rights passed with support from the Civil Engagement group, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. That was brought to the fore because of the actions of IMPACT trade union. The comments that have been made in regard to Ryanair are valid. This is a 30-year issue coming to bite Michael O'Leary quite hard. The message has to go out to the people of Ireland that there are good decent trade unions that one can be a member of that will fight for one's workplace rights and that membership of that union will always be a good thing and money well spent in terms of being part of that. I congratulate all the members of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, many of whom feel strongly on this issue in many directions. My party would call on the Government to move quickly. We hope that no political party, regardless of its reservations, would stop the people from having a say on this issue. We have had the Citizens' Assembly and now the deliberations of the joint committee. We need a referendum now. I hope that no party in the Oireachtas would stop that from happening. I also make a call in regard to the campaign - many of us are anxious about its tone - that on this occasion the erection of posters is something that might be reconsidered on both sides. If we are to have a calm debate, if we are to have something on which people can reflect and analyse, the sloganeering and images that could potentially be erected on posters around the country are things that could be re-examined in terms of their appropriateness in this situation.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I think "dear Leader" is a bit much.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Remember the McFeely guy?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sometimes in Irish politics one can become very cynical and wonder if anything ever gets achieved. Today, there is magic in the air because of the campaigning zeal of the Irish Deaf Society, which pursued the issue of sign language for a long time. As I said to a group of secondary school students yesterday, if one believes in something, and believes that it is just and right and are willing to pursue it, one will always win. It helps when one gets a decent politician on one's side. That decent politician is Senator Mark Daly. I think he is to be commended by everybody across the House on his zeal in pursuing this issue. At a time when the Department of Justice and Equality is receiving much criticism, and many feel justifiably so, I recognise the work of Deaglán Ó Briain, a person with whom I worked, who is a committed and extremely professional civil servant and I think his fingerprints are clearly to be seen in the Bill. It would be appropriate for all Irish schoolchildren to be in a position to learn Irish Sign Language in order to communicate with fellow citizens. Surely that would be the next step in this regard. I congratulate the campaigners, Senator Mark Daly, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and his officials. Today, I think all Members feel that little bit of magic that politics can sometimes bring.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This morning, we saw the best of Irish politics in the passing of the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016. In this issue, we see the worst of Irish politics. Everybody knows the damage alcohol and addiction cause in this country. I was moved by the contribution of Senator Black. She has exposed the influence that special interests and lobbyists have had on the Houses of the Oireachtas concerning this legislation, which is why we are debating these amendments. Two people die each week as a result of fatal overdoses of alcohol. These are not people who fall in front of vehicles or down stairs. They drink so much that they die. Approximately 100 die in this way every year. It is remarkable that whenever legislation relating to drink-driving or public health alcohol measures comes before the House, the political system still cannot step up to the mark and deliver it in an unamended form that will actually help to save lives. There always seems to be a way for people to wriggle out of the attempt at legislating. In a huge number of other areas of public policy that affect peoples lives, this does not happen. Remarkably, the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017, which will also save lives, went through the Oireachtas without amendment. When it comes to alcohol, we all say the right things. We say that alcohol is bad and that young people do not know what they are doing. By the way, I must respond to that. To suggest that young people are the only individuals in the country who drink to excess is to completely miss the point. Young people have learned their behaviour from their parents, who, in turn, learned their behaviour from their own parents. The country in which we live has a completely dysfunctional relationship with alcohol. However, whenever legislation is introduced, we find ways around doing the right thing. I will say this much. I was so proud to be a member of the Oireachtas today because of the efforts of Senator Mark Daly, along with the Irish Deaf Society, in bringing forward legislation that we all applauded. This afternoon, however, I am ashamed to be a member of this Oireachtas because-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I remind colleagues that if they took this issue as it deserves to be taken, they would not just agree with every single word of what Senator Black has said, they would do exactly what she is advocating that we do. There always seems to be a way around doing the right thing when it comes to alcohol in this country. We have made progress, but it is not in any way the progress that we should be making.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«How many Fine Gael Senators were present on Wednesday night?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There was one. All the Fine Gael Senators are lining up in the Chamber to talk about the impact of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill on shopkeepers. There was only one Fine Gael Senator present when we were discussing the motion on special needs assistants. Such hypocrisy. I did not have a clue what she was discussing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am an Irishman, the son of a woman who was forced to leave the Civil Service when she got married, a grandson of women who were born with no right to vote, and the brother of a woman who was born in the year the eighth amendment was passed when, as Ms Emily O'Reilly put it, the "Masterminds of the Right" got their way. It was the year Ms Sheila Hodgers died, having been denied treatment for her cancer while she was pregnant. I am an Irishman. I live in a city dotted with physical reminders of Magdalen laundries, in a country with deep secrets of baby plots, mother and baby homes, sexual abuse and violence, where older women bear the mental and physical scars of churching and symphysiotomy. I am an Irishman. Television images of my childhood were of violence, emigration, unemployment and occasionally of women who should not be believed. It was not that simple in the land of the whispering corners. It was really the fault of Ms Joanne Hayes, Ann Lovett and Ms Annie Murphy. It was really the fault of the girl in the X case and the law was there to prove it. I am an Irishman. I stand in a Parliament, still overwhelmingly male, led by a Government which is overwhelmingly male and reported on by a media that is overwhelmingly male, who say there are two extremes to this debate on the eighth amendment. There are not two extremes to this debate,. There is only one, and that is the extreme that demands of all women in every circumstance to be forced always to take a certain course of action. The other side, my side, does not demand that of any women. I stand in a Parliament dominated by parties who speak of republicanism, who glorify post colonial victimhood, but who cannot genuinely appreciate that by ourselves alone we have perpetuated this injustice in contradiction of the human rights norm of every western democracy. I am an Irishman. I will never be told by a doctor, nurse, or a medical professional that protecting my life or my health is constitutionally complex or legally uncertain. I will never have to employ legal representation from a hospital bed and no one will ever equate my life or health to the unborn because I am an Irishman. I know that fundamentally this debate centres on a distrust of women, but I cannot fathom the intense loneliness and abandonment that thousands of women have felt over the years as they wait at airport departure gates or ferry terminals to travel abroad to terminate their pregnancies. Many have remained silent because of the whispering corners. I am an Irishman, so I struggle to imagine the anguish and torture in a young woman's mind as she handles an abortion pill she ordered online as she sits alone in her room, consumed with the reality that she cannot tell anyone, not a friend, a doctor, not even a soulmate. These women are of Ireland, as much as our music, sport and dance. They are to be trusted to be empowered. The Constitution must protect them in every single way as much as it protects Irishmen.  In recent years, I have heard these names haunt the corridors of this building: Ms Savita Halappanavar, Ms Louise O'Keeffe, Ms Máiría Cahill, Ms A, Ms B, Ms C, Ms D, Ms Y, Ms Amanda Mellet and Ms Siobhan Whelan. I am an Irishman and there is much to be ashamed of and much to be proud of, because I did not always subscribe to this point of view. It has been the inspirational women in my life and in my party, the Labour Party, who have helped to bring me to this compassionate position. They have reminded me that there were always voices who would not be silenced - from Ms Evelyn Owens to Máirín de Burca, Mary Robinson to Senator Ivana Bacik, women who stood for and stand for a different Ireland. I am an Irishman, and I stand in awe of the mná who will not be silenced anymore. They speak through the National Women's Council, Terminations for Medical Reasons, Amnesty International, and through repeal groups in every corner of this country. Individuals, such as Ms Tara Flynn and Róisín Ingle, have placed themselves at the centre of a whirlwind of abuse because they are not going to take it anymore. Women contact politicians such as me in confidence about their stories. I am an Irishman and I want a Constitution that liberates, not imprisons; a society that inspires compassion, not blame; and a State that lives up to the republican gospel of the Proclamation that speaks to Irish men and Irish women and puts to rest finally this dangerous and oppressive amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am having a great day. I just came from a meeting about drug policy where I got some compliments about my work as a Minister of State and then I walk into this Chamber and Senator Conway has just said something nice about me.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Then I pick up the Minister's speech and there is a reference to the work I did at some stage-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am blushing. I did not even need to wear a pink shirt today because if I had worn a white one, my rosy cheeks would have been reflected in it given the wonderful things that people are saying about my work in government. I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve. That is all very well but, unfortunately, I have to take the same tack as Senator Norris in opposing the measure in front of us for a number of reasons. This all comes from a Supreme Court judgment. That is unfortunate because during my time in the Department of Justice and Equality, and working with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, this came from a sense of justice. I refer to a sense of a great injustice that was being done in our society. As Senator Conway said, in years to come, there will be a State apology for those who have been languishing in the system for a long time. It has come from that. Something needs to be done. The strongest voices in Irish society on the issue of direct provision were in this very Chamber, right across the political divide. What upsets me is that the reaction to what needed to happen came from a Supreme Court judgment. It did not come from within the Department itself or from the political leadership in the Department but because the Minister was told to do it. That is a great shame. In six weeks' time the Taoiseach will be in the White House and will hand President Trump a bowl of shamrock. I am sure that in a side office somewhere, he and his representatives will say to President Trump that he needs to do something about his immigration policy and that it needs to be a bit more humane to the Irish. Yet, we have 26,000 undocumented workers who need regulation. We will not do what we are asking the Americans to do. Ireland and Lithuania are the only two countries in Europe which refuse point blank to give asylum seekers access to the labour market. As was so eloquently put by Senator Black, that sense of dignity of coming home, washing one's hands after a day's work and talking to one's children about that work is the reason for getting up in the morning. It is fundamental to our identity. It also leads into all these myths about asylum seekers in terms of what they can and cannot do and the entitlements they have. We have all heard them. They are all lies. An asylum seeker is not entitled to work, even if he or she wants to. What is frustrating is the lack of leadership. The political leadership in the Department should be sick to the pit of its stomach at the scenario that we are overseeing and should be trying to change it. I refer also to the hypocrisy of going around the world talking about immigration policy when we cannot do it ourselves. I love the paragraph in the Minister's speech in which I am mentioned, but I take issue with it. It states that the court's decision means that labour market access for applicants must now take place under a two stage process and uses the words "with the best will in the world". I have, and the Minister probably has, the best will in the world but the Department of Justice and Equality has lost any credibility to utter a statement about having the best will in the world. It has shown zero goodwill to any asylum seeker who comes to this country. I know from my time there that the overarching phrase it wants everybody to think about, which it would almost have painted on every wall in the Department, underneath the bulletproof windows, is "pull factor". Before doing anything in the Department of Justice and Equality, one must be concerned at all times about the potential pull factor.That is really what drives this debate. The idea of having best will is, unfortunately, bordering on laughable. It will not be possible for us to have completed all the procedures required to confirm opting in to the directive by 9 February. The Supreme Court judgment was made on 31 May, if I am not mistaken. The judgment called on the Department to do something within six months and then gave the Department another two months to do something. If the Government was serious about this issue, it would have seen the Supreme Court judgment on 31 May as a fantastic political opportunity to set things right. It was an opportunity to declare that no longer would Ireland be one of only two countries in Europe not to allow asylum seekers into the labour market, no longer would we be an outlier in this regard and no longer would we have a questionable record when it comes to direct provision and the housing of asylum seekers. We can do this far better but unfortunately that was not the reaction. The suggestion that we operate an employment system under the 2003 Act has been made. It has already been stated that an applicant would have to earn over €30,000 per year. I recognise there is the potential to waive the €500 or €1,000 fee to enter the scheme. There are approximately 60 jobs that an applicant cannot do. The measure reflects classic Department of Justice and Equality thinking. I mean no disrespect to people who work in that Department. However, I know what the Department of Justice and Equality is like. It is about security, law and order, the Garda and prisons. It covers a vast bulk of legislation that goes through these Houses. That is what the Department of Justice and Equality is for. Those in the Department do not really believe that it is their job to have a humanitarian outlook when it comes to issues of people coming to this country to seek asylum. They always refer to the pull factor. We know there have been difficult cases of people who have been possibly raped or victims of violence or torture and who have come into this country. Regardless of the issue, there will always be an official somewhere in the Department who will whisper into the ear of the Minister or the Minister of State words about the pull factor. On that basis I regret to say the Labour Party will not support this move in the Seanad or the Dáil. We will support any vote that is called to reject the measure not because we want to do it, but because when it comes to best will and good will we have gone far past the capacity to believe a word that comes from the Department of Justice and Equality on this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will raise two issues. The first is the issue of the section 39 workers who, with their representative body, SIPTU, unfortunately have come to the conclusion that they have no option but to go on strike on 14 and 15 February. The Government must take this issue quite seriously. They are people employed in voluntary organisations who have service level agreements with the HSE. They are coming to the end of their tether. I remind the Government that when the Labour Party was in government, we spent a huge amount of time and energy trying to restore people's pay by bringing in legislation that has effectively helped to restore the pay of contract cleaners, security workers and people in the public service. The eye has been taken off the ball in this regard. We have industrial action from special needs assistants, SNAs, teachers who are deeply upset about the lack of pace in pay equalisation and now we have section 39 workers. Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has form in cracking down on workers' rights in some of his previous pronouncements. The supposed leader of the Independent Alliance has made scurrilous remarks about the trade union movement in the past.I hope that is not the type of rhetoric that will be used to deal with this particular issue. Nobody wants to see section 39 workers on strike. I wish the Government would deal with this issue and begin to restore their pay because they do not want to be on strike. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in that regard. Second, I want to raise the issue of schools, particularly those on the north side and south side of Dublin, which are selling their lands to private developers. We have an issue in St. Paul's, Raheny, whereby the Vincentian order was handed land from Dublin City Council in the 1950s but has now sold that land to a private developer. A planning application for a huge development has been made, which will effectively destroy St. Anne's Park on the north side. We also have a situation on the south side, about which Councillor Deirdre Kingston in Dún Laoghaire has alerted me, whereby the Edmund Rice Schools Trust is asking the Minister for Education and skills to disband the board of management of Clonkeen College due to the latter taking a court case to prevent the selling of lands in that school. It is about time the Minister for Education and Skills got out from behind his desk, came into this Chamber and began to discuss the reality of communities across Dublin and, I assume, across the country losing playing pitches and community facilities because religious orders are selling them off to private developers. In this quite concerning case, the trust wants to abolish the board of management that is taking this case and is asking the Minister to facilitate that. I believe the Minister has a real role in this situation. I ask the Leader to facilitate his arrival in the Chamber in order that we can stop the religious orders from selling off lands, selling out local communities and trying to abolish the boards of management of the schools that are doing such a great job both in this school and in schools nationwide.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate it. I also appreciate Senator Ruane sharing her time. There are two issues on which we will be tabling amendments. One is ICTU's request to be represented on the governing authority to counterbalance the influence of industry. That is a reasonable request. The second is the issue Senator Ruane has already raised about student union representation, not just student representation but student union representation. It is extremely important to us. We will be tabling amendments on those two issues and I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to accept them.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to register my disappointment that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is not here. While I understand he is taking questions in the Dáil, there is also a Minister of State in the same Department, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, who happens to be a local Deputy and who would have great insight into the issue I am raising. For some reason, she is also unavailable and I have to debate the matter with a Minister of State from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I do not think it is good enough.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am just making my protest, if that is okay.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The office of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is a constitutional office. It asked the Minister for Education and Skills to come here to discuss a matter in respect of his Department. There is a Minister of State in that Department who is also a local Deputy-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My protest is nothing personal against the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle. Perhaps he could convey it to the Minister for Education and Skills. The issue at hand here is a school in Dún Laoghaire, the lands of which the patron body is determined to sell for commercial development. The board of management of the school is determined to stop that from happening. It mirrors a situation in St. Anne's Park affecting St. Paul's school, in the constituency in which I live, where the order has sold the lands to a private developer. Those lands were handed to the order by the city council for use as playing fields. A private developer now owns them and is trying to develop them. While there is major local opposition, it is spilt milk. The issue in Clonkeen College, however, is not spilt milk. We have the bizarre situation where the patron body is now more than threatening to disband the board of management of the school, whose crime is merely defending the interests of the school and the local community. The Minister is the only person who can actually make the decision on this. That might be part of the reason we do not have a representative from the Department of Education and Skills to debate the matter with me. The Minister cannot hide behind constitutional advice, the Department or an Oireachtas committee. The decision is his and his alone. I understand from media reporting that it has to be made by tomorrow.  Will the Department of Education and Skills stand beside the patron body and, effectively, by the developer and sack the board of management? Is the Minister going to stand beside the board and the school community, many members of which are in the Gallery to watch the debate, including one of the local representatives, Councillor Deirdre Kingston? Will the Minister stand with the community and ensure that the board remains intact? It is a very simple question and a simple decision. If it was my decision, I know what I would do. I am interested to hear what has been handed to the Minister of State to read out.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not like doing this. I acknowledge the Minister of State has been sent in here to do what he was asked to do. I understand the Minister is in the Dáil at the moment and can appreciate that. As for any communications that were made to my office in respect of this debate, I have no knowledge of them because I have not seen them. There is a Minister of State in that Department - who also happens to be a local Deputy - who could be here. I have received a six-sentence reply. The only person who can make this decision is the Minister. The Minister could make his views as to whose side he is on clearly known to the local community, the board of management and the patron body. Just as I mentioned that he did not have anywhere else to hide, he has found somewhere else to hide. This is absolutely ridiculous. This is not a constituency matter for me. It is on the far side of the county as far as I am concerned. To my mind, it is a matter of national importance in which a patron body decided to sell off land in a school in order that a developer could build on local playing pitches. If the board of management decides to defend the rights of the school, the patron body is going to sack the board. The Minister has a determination to make as to whether he is going to sack the board. He did not come in here and did not send in his Minister of State, who happens to be a local Deputy, and then he sent a six-sentence reply on the situation. We are none the wiser as to what his decision will be. I genuinely do not think this is good enough. I do not like playing party politics when it comes to issues like this. The matter is extremely important for this individual school and probably every school across the country that has playing pitches. Local communities will be asking if this is what they are going to be up against in a couple of years. They will be wondering if their local boards of management will be sacked too if they have a problem with it. Where is the Minister on this? If I was Minister for Education and Skills or if my party held that Ministry, this would be a very simple decision.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I intend to share time with Senator Kevin Humphreys.  I welcome the Minister and thank her for her indication of support for the Bill. It is much appreciated. I wish to read some words written by Tom Johnson almost 100 years ago. Today we are recognising the 100th anniversary of the granting of the vote to some women for the first time in 1918. Since we are going through a period of reflection on from where we have come and where we are, it is important for us to reflect on the revolutionary ethos that underpinned those times. I speak of Tom Johnson because he was the first leader of the Labour Party in the Oireachtas. He was asked to pen the first democratic programme of the First Dáil. As the Labour Party had not sought election in 1918, the honour was given to him to write it. He wrote: It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as Citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland.It was the children to whom Tom Johnson turned first. As you know, a Chathaoirligh, our legislation requires children to be in school between the ages of six and 16 years. Unfortunately, there are problems with the attendance records of many children aged four or five years in the school system. Obviously, these problems are not of their making and it is within the power of their parents or guardians to deal with them. They will have a major impact on their ability to reach their potential in later years. I have read through the international research on the abilities of children at early ages. I often quote from the 1995 Hart and Risley report which concluded that the average three year old from a welfare dependent family had, on average, one third of the oral language capacity of a three year old from a rich or advantaged family. A poor child aged three years has 400 words, while a rich child - if a child can be rich at the age of three years - has 1,200. Even at the earliest stage, a disadvantaged child has a major gap to close. I view literacy and educational disadvantage in the way tuberculosis was viewed in the 1940s and 1950s when it was said no one should get sick because he or she was poor. It is similar with illiteracy. People will always have difficulty in reading, but they should never have difficulty in reading because they are poor. Effectively, we are trying to deal with four and five year olds with chronic attendance difficulties. Often they can be sick, for which there are reasons. Any medical professional will back up the family and deal with Tusla in that regard. However, if a parent is poor and in despair and in a family that is struggling to function because of any number of stresses and strains, including addiction and poverty, bringing a child to school can be the last thing on his or her list of priorities. We want to ensure that if a child is four or five years of age and vulnerable and at the beginning of the educational journey, that journey will be defended by the State, Tusla, the political system and legislation.Unfortunately, families often do not understand the power of education and the importance of being in school every day. As a former school principal in an area of acute disadvantage, I know that Mondays and Fridays often fell by the wayside. On half days, people often took full days off. Christmas and summer can be difficult. It is not because parents or guardians do not love their children but it is because education has failed too many parents and too many people. When they look at school or education, they are looking at something very negative. In some instances they would rather be friends with their children than parents. That is completely understandable. The Minister rolled out and robustly defended the ABC programme which we started in the last Government. These are programmes across acutely disadvantaged areas. They empower parents to understand the power of oral language, literacy, school attendance and diet, which can prepare a child for life. The scheme in Darndale is called Preparing for Life. In our Bill, we want four and five year olds to be prepared for life. If children are not regular attenders at school, it should be within the capacity of Tusla to intervene with the family but not in a negative or an aggressive way, or in a way that would undermine the parents, but in a compassionate and empowering way which ensures parents and guardians can ensure that attendance patterns are improved. The Minister will appreciate that if a four or five year old is missing from school for 60 to 90 days a year, we can be sure those attendance patterns will be as bad if not worse if we fast forward ten years. We should be striving for the total eradication of illiteracy. I met an educational psychologist in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, called Tommy MacKay who speaks in those terms. Unfortunately, the ambition for our language has not been strong enough. We have spoken about breaking the cycle and delivering equality of opportunity in schools. However, striving for the total eradication of illiteracy has to be our goal. Attendance at school for four and five year old boys and girls across this State is something we need to strive for. As the Minister said, under 50% of four year olds are enrolled in schools but the vast majority of five year olds are. If a child has chronic attendance issues, the teacher or principal of the school is effectively powerless because of the legislative issue of only requiring children to be in school between six and 16 years of age. With the best will in the world, a teacher or a principal can only go so far. With our amendment, any child enrolled in school aged four or five will come under the auspices of the Educational Welfare Act. That will be a positive move. I appreciate the Government is supporting and will facilitate the Bill. I appreciate there is broad agreement in this House that this Bill is a good piece of work. As we recall our past and look to our future, we should note that throughout the history of our State it is our children who have been let down time and again. Education is the great liberator and the one thing that will drag a child out of poverty. It is said the most revolutionary action a girl can take is to pick up a book. That is why Boko Haram is kidnapping schoolgirls in Nigeria and that is why Malala Yousafzai's life was threatened with a gunshot as she was on her way to school. A ten year old girl with a book is probably the most dangerous thing in the world. What we need to encourage in Ireland is the ambition that four and five year old children with books can change the world. However, if they are not in school everyday, if their families are not in a position to send them to school everyday or if they feel that education is down the list of priorities, then there has to be an agency that can empower those parents and guardians to bring those children back to school. Tusla is that agency but I appreciate that it will say it is under-resourced in terms of educational welfare officers. We can have a discussion about the number of educational welfare officers. Let us defend the rights of four and five olds to their education, if they are enrolled in a school they want to attend. As the Minister knows, primary schools across Ireland are the most wonderful places in the country, regardless of quibbles and complaints about resources and various different things that will always be needed. A person cannot walk into any primary school in the country and not be uplifted. I refer to professionalism, love, care and just the buzz of what children bring to a place. That is what we are trying to achieve. Thankfully, we are achieving that together. We appreciate the Minister's support for this Bill which will become law and four and five year olds will have their educational rights protected.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes. I thank the Cathaoirleach. I also thank the Government for accepting the Bill and the Minister for her positive speech and her engagement, which has been a delight. I appreciate the comments of those Senators from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin who have contributed on the debate.I want to put on the record of the House my appreciation to Tony McGillicuddy who penned the Bill. Approximately five years ago I tried to introduce it as a back bench Labour Party Deputy but it went into a raffle that I did not win. I then became a Minister of State and was unable to pursue it further. In any event, I thank the Minister for taking it on. It is an important issue and I appreciate the comments made by other Senators. Regardless of the cut and thrust of these Houses, there are vulnerable children who need our support for whom small measures can last a lifetime. If, as a result of the Bill, one family engages in a positive way with Tusla and corrects the attendance issues of a child in school, we will have done good work today. It will affect more than just one family, however. I also recognise the attendance of Noel Kelly. In a previous incarnation, he was very involved in the Preparing for Life scheme in Darndale that I referenced earlier. The scheme has changed countless numbers of lives in Dublin 17. This Bill is part of a wider suite of measures that we need to discuss. Senator Ruane had an engaging conversation at the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on access at all levels of education. Campaigns were mentioned about trying to keep libraries open and have people think differently about education. Why is it that some people in our Republic, when asked to sign their charge sheet, will sign it with an X? It is because that is the only way they know to sign it. This happened early on in the person's life and was not changed in time so that this person would not have to sign the charge sheet with an X. That is the reality for too many people in our Republic. Education is about empowerment and offering choice and different roads for people to take. Those roads should not be closed off at four or five years of age. As a former primary school principal, I know that it is not too late but it can be very difficult to change things at the age of four. Many teachers will say that they know by the child's demeanour that one four year old will have fewer challenges than another who might be sitting right beside him or her. It is upsetting to say that it is possibly too late for a four year old, and of course it is not too late for a four year old, but the damage that can be done to a child at that age can be difficult to reverse. With the Bill we are trying to set positive patterns of attendance at the earliest age of a child's school life. There will be conversations about whether a child belongs in a formal school setting at four years of age and the Minister referred to that in her contribution. I appreciate her observations in that regard. Given the positive mindset she has brought to her Department and to the Bill, however, I think that this can be one of a suite of measures that we, on a cross-party basis, can introduce to try to improve the educational outcomes of the most vulnerable children in our Republic. I appreciate the Minister's attendance in the House and her acceptance of the Bill as well as all the comments made across the Chamber. I look forward to progressing the Bill and seeing it enacted in the not too distant future.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the floor of this House last week, I raised the issue of religious orders selling off to private developers lands forming part of school properties, with boards of management in certain parts of this city being abolished as a result. The Cathaoirleach facilitated a debate during Commencement matters between the Minister and me to discuss the issue in some depth. I would like to put a letter I have received from a developer on the record of the House. It is quite disturbing. Developers in this country used to own people in the Oireachtas and councillors up and down this land. They used to stuff envelopes full of cash. They now send what I would consider to be threatening letters to people who want to defend the rights of communities to engage in the planning process, and to object or give observations on planning applications. I will read one paragraph, if I might. It states:I am prompted to write to you following remarks you made in Seanad Éireann on January 30th in relation to our proposal to deliver 536 housing units on lands at St Paul's School, Raheny.You stated that our proposed development would "destroy St. Anne's Park" and would result in a loss of playing pitches and community facilities. Your remarks are fundamentally inaccurate and are the latest example of a catalogue of misinformation being dispersed through various mediums and by various people about our development. As you may appreciate, if such inaccurate and flawed information is not corrected in the same public manner in which it was transmitted, it is likely to have a negative impact on our development, which, in turn, will have ramifications for those responsible.I would like the Leader of the House to restate in the strongest terms the following: that Members of this Oireachtas are not to receive threatening letters from developers; that those days are gone; that no-one in this House is beholden to a developer any more; that in a republic, one is quite entitled to stand up for one's local community; and that for any developer to send any Member of the Oireachtas, councillor or public representative a letter threatening "ramifications" is bang out of order. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Here we go again with all of these rural people.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the comprehensive nature of the Minister's speech. This is a lengthy Bill. It will take some time to digest the Bill and the Minister's speech. I was quite impressed by the Minister's stamina and ability to get through it in the manner in which he did. This is a terrifying area, which the Minister and his officials appreciate. No matter how we try to legislate for this area, the fear is that in five years' time whatever we have on the Statute Book will be out of date. Those who are engaged in this sphere in a malevolent and dangerous way are trying to work their way around national and European legislation and will spend whatever money they can to stay ahead of the game.The danger is not only that privacy rights, which are central to what we are trying to achieve, will be lost but also that the protection of children will be undermined. We are in a dangerous area and I expect the legislation will touch on everything we do from here onwards in all spheres, whether transport, education, health, foreign affairs or another area. When I was the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, we found that regardless of what we sought to do on the drugs issue, fashions and the ability to manipulate things changed, which meant we struggled to keep ahead of the game. I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve and the Labour Party will not be obstructive in seeking to achieve our aims. We will introduce amendments to strengthen and improve the Bill. We appreciate that the Minister is doing his best to do the right thing.  The issues as they relate to children frighten all of us. While most people will have questions about setting the age of consent at 13 years, from listening to media reports and the Minister's comments on the offices and bona fides of those who arrived at this age threshold, I believe it is difficult to argue with their rationale. We will also focus on this area. On the political aspects of the issue, if we were honest about the way we use data, we could have a highly illuminating conversation. Reference was made to the marked register, which is data that all politicians who have their heads screwed on use to their benefit. The register shows who has voted and in which election or referendum they voted. When we visit a house we then know that X, Y or Z person registered at the address voted in the previous election or referendum. The data and knowledge available to people in authority and those with influence must be regulated. We need to be comfortable with this and people need to know that this information is readily available. However, we are in the middle of a digital age which will only gather pace. It will be a serious challenge for parliamentarians and legislators to keep up with it. The Labour Party will do its best to be of assistance with the legislation. I genuinely appreciate the efforts the Minister and his officials are making. In the years ahead, it will be necessary to amend the legislation many times to make it more relevant. Éamon De Valera once spoke of being terrified by the advent of television. I am genuinely terrified by technology, even though I use it every day and it offers the potential to make much money. However, children can also be damaged, hurt, humiliated and worse because of the age in which we live. I know the Minister appreciates that. With the support of Senators from across the House, we will get the best possible legislation for the citizens of this country. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I second Senator Nash's proposed amendment to the Order of Business regarding the very important legislation he hopes will be taken today. I wish to raise two issues with the Leader. One is the outrageous move by the Department of Education and Skills to place a cap for some reason on the enrolment of five Educate Together primary schools across the country. I have been contacted by a number of parents and local representatives in New Ross, Tramore, Trim, Castlebar and Tuam, all of whom are perplexed as to why the Department has decided to place a 13 student cap on the enrolment numbers for next September for each of these Educate Together schools. It is quite surprising considering that in the last number of years there was a large roll-out of Educate Together schools across the country under the former Ministers, Ruairí Quinn and Jan O'Sullivan. Plebiscites were held in most parts of the country to find out, for the first time, the type of patronage model that interested most parents and much to the surprise of some, although not to people in the Labour Party, many parents were interested in the multi-denominational model. A number of schools were subsequently established. However, now the schools in New Ross, Tramore, Trim, Castlebar and Tuam are being told they can only take in 13 pupils from September. I wonder if there is some type of institutional bias in the Department against these schools because no other patronage schools are being asked to put a cap on their numbers. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the Seanad with the Minister for Education and Skills on this important issue. A number of parents are quite disturbed by this development. Second, I wish to raise the Children's Rights Alliance Report Card 2018. To be fair, and I try to be fair in my deliberations here, many of the grades the Children's Rights Alliance has given the Government have improved from last year. That should be acknowledged. However, two issues arise from the report and it would be interesting to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the House to discuss them. One is child and family homelessness, for which a grade E has been given by the Children's Rights Alliance. There are many grades to show that the Government is clearly delivering, which is commendable, but on the issue of child homelessness it is an E grade for the second year in a row from the Children's Rights Alliance, which is a reputable organisation. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be invited to the House to discuss that. The second issue in the report is general practitioner, GP, care for children. The last Government introduced free GP care for every child in the Republic under six years of age and we expected that it would be extended to every child under 12 years of age within a short period of time. Now the Minister is talking about a flat fee of perhaps €5 or €10 for every visit, which we would flatly oppose. Perhaps the Leader would respond on those three issues; the roll-out of free GP care for children between six and 12 years of age; the issue of child and family homelessness; and the pertinent issue of the day, the crazy cap that has been placed on enrolment in Educate Together schools in five areas of the country.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support these amendments. It is not only necessary to have a student representative but a students' union representative. We would not want a student representative to be chosen by the governing body or by a body that is alien to the students' union. Students' unions are constituted by the student body itself. We would be keen that it would be a students' union representative. I also find myself in a similar position to Senator Norris in that I am disappointed at the Government's failure to accept these amendments. We had tabled an amendment about having an Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, representative on the governing body as well and that amendment was ruled out on the spurious ground that it represented a cost to the Exchequer. I support these amendments. We should have a vote. I hope that people in this House will see sense and vote in favour of the amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«When I raised yesterday the fact that five Educate Together schools have been told that their enrolment for September is being curtailed - each of them is being allowed to take in just 13 students - I was advised by the Leader to submit a Commencement debate request. I have done that and I hope the debate in question will take place tomorrow. I would like the Minister to come to this House to discuss the issue of multidenominational education in the context of three campaigns across the country that are looking for Educate Together status at second level. The campaign in Galway is being assisted by Councillor Niall McNelis and the campaign in south Kildare is being assisted by Councillor Mark Wall. The third campaign is in Dublin 13, which is my own part of the world. Parents feel very strongly about the continuum of education under this model of patronage. It would be good to have a debate in this House on multidenominational education in its totality, and Educate Together in particular. Senator Feighan has made a solid suggestion in relation to the political impasse in Northern Ireland. Given that there are two vacant seats in this House, we could ask the Government to seek political agreement across all parties in the Oireachtas for the allocation of each of those seats, respectively to an individual from the unionist tradition and an individual from the nationalist tradition in Northern Ireland. I suggest that such a positive move would represent an imaginative response to the current impasse from this Chamber.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am of the view that it would attract good cross-party support in this House. What we have in the North is the failure of two extremes - extreme nationalism from the Sinn Féin side and extreme nationalism from the DUP - to come-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----to a reasonable accommodation to get the Executive up and running again. I think Senator Feighan has made a reasonable suggestion. The voices of extremes are not doing the business. The people are being let down.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Voices from the mainstream of Northern Irish society should be facilitated in this House, as they were in the past when people like Gordon Wilson were Members of the Seanad.This is a viable suggestion and is worthy of consideration and support from across these Houses. I will say this much: it is remarkable that when one makes a reasonable proposition about moderate voices that want to advance-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is remarkable that when someone in this House makes-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----a suggestion about having moderate voices that are progressive and want to advance the cause of the people of Northern Ireland, one gets shouted at by one of the extreme nationalist voices in this House.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that the Leader has facilitated statements on housing. I hope to contribute to the debate. The issue of the sale of loans by Permanent TSB to a vulture fund has been highlighted in the media recently, particularly by Fianna Fáil. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is a good move because all of us in this House should be very concerned about this. When one comes across families who are in mortgage distress as a result of the actions of vulture funds, as many in this Chamber do-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is particularly difficult to make my contribution.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«May I start again?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is, actually.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My problem is that, having just come from an RTÉ debate on education, I am back in principal mode. Students should be seated at all times.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that the Leader has facilitated the debate. It is a timely one. My second point is on multidenominational education. There was a Commencement debate yesterday on the five schools across the State that have limited enrolment, the Educate Together schools. There is an ongoing issue concerning the relationship between the State and schools that are selling off lands. With Councillor Deirdre Kingston, I met a group yesterday that is very concerned about the issue in Clonkeen. We are concerned about the lack of movement on Educate Together second level schools and on the baptism barrier. There is a considerable debate that needs to be had in this Chamber with the Minister on the relationship between the State and patron bodies and on the facts that patron bodies are selling off lands under the noses of boards of management, that boards of management are now being threatened with abolition, that primary schools that do not have religious patronage are now being told they can have only a certain number of students in September, and that Educate Together skills at second level are not getting support from the Department.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is news to me. That is great and much appreciated. I do not know what to say now. I talked about housing-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Leas-Cheann Comhairle just ruined my Facebook video.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I fully support the amendment and the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris. His amendment goes to the very core of our belief system and education. It brings to mind the vacuous statement that has been kicked around the place in recent years that Ireland should be the best little country in the world in which to do business. It really worries me that a Senator of such standing as Senator Norris must table an amendment like this one to scratch away at the very foundation ethos of what we are trying to build. Are we trying to create economic units to fit into an economy? Do we believe in the liberation of education? The problem is there is a suspicion or a preconceived idea, which may be unfair, that the Bill, the Government and the Department lean towards industry and commerce and not towards the liberation of the mind. With that in mind, my party and I have on three separate occasions, in three different ways, and with three different wordings tried to ensure a member from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, could sit on the board of the governing authority for each technological university. Unfortunately, my party and I have been rebuffed three times. We simply tried to find a counterbalance to the entrepreneurial spirit that will be enshrined in the Bill. The amendment tabled by Senator Norris and supported by Senator Grace O'Sullivan is crucial. It goes to the very heart of what we, in this Republic, fundamentally believe in when it comes to education. I believe that we should live in a society and not an economy. The purpose of education is to free the mind and not purely to produce entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial spirit is fine and good. It is important for an economy but it is not the reason that we live. It is not the reason that blood courses through our veins or that hair stands up on the back of our necks. Amendment No. 5 is possibly one of the most crucial amendments that we will debate and it will be illuminating to hear the Minister of State's reaction.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. It is a matter of disappointment to me that neither the Minister for Education and Skills nor one of the Ministers of State at that Department have come here for this debate. I will raise the matter nonetheless in the hope of getting some kind of constructive reply. As the Labour Party spokesperson on education, I am concerned about the Government's capacity to deal with the relationship between the State and the religious patron bodies when it comes to education. I suspect that the bent of the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister who is in charge of that Department is against the multidenominational model. We have yet to see the baptism barrier legislation. A number of campaigns seeking to establish second level Educate Together schools around the country, particularly in Galway, Kildare and Dublin 13, are getting no support from the Department. A departmental circular that was issued last week, and about which the Minister has spoken, will lead to changes in religious instruction in a number of schools. For some reason, the new circular does not cover all schools even though students have a constitutional right not to partake in religious instruction. Religious orders that are seeking to sell off lands at a number of schools have threatened to disband boards of management that have the temerity to resist the sale of such lands or to ask the Minister to disband them. Along with Councillor Deirdre Kingston, I am dealing with the particular case of Clonkeen College at the moment. The relationship between the State and the education system, which is effectively run by patron bodies, is affecting a plethora of issues. The State should be willing to use its power, for the good of pupils and the people in general, to support a model of education that is outside religious influence. Five new Educate Together primary schools in New Ross, Trim, Tuam, Tramore and Castlebar have been told by the Department that they should have restricted enrolments of just 13 pupils from next September. When the Labour Party was in government, it went out of its way to petition people and parent bodies in various parts of the country for the first time to ascertain the level of interest in different models of education. Despite much scepticism, we discovered that there is a huge level of interest throughout the country in a different model of education that is not under religious influence. Five schools that were established at that time are now being told by the Department that they must have restricted enrolment from next September. What is the thought process behind that decision? Why have these schools been singled out? Is it mere coincidence that they all happen to be Educate Together schools? Perhaps this and all the other things I have mentioned - the baptism barrier, the circular on religious instruction, the failure to support campaigns seeking to establish second level Educate Together schools and the threat from religious orders to disband boards of management if they stand in the way of the sale of school lands - are in line with the conservative mindset of a Department that has met the conservative mindset of the Minister. On this issue, will anybody from the Government genuinely say that the Department of Education and Skills under the tenure of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is going to defend in any way the right of parents to have their children educated under the patronage of a multidenominational patron body? I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response to that question so that we can toss this issue around and debate it further.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I just do not understand the reply. I wish I did. I will probably have to read it on another occasion to get to the bottom of what the Minister of State is saying. Unfortunately, the Department and Minister are strangling the five schools. They will not be able to survive. They know they will not be able to survive if they are being told that, by next September, they will be able to take in only 13 students. Will the cap remain in place and will the Minister change his mind? Could the Minister of State cut through the entire answer and give me the direct answer I require? I appreciate the responsible Department is not that of the Minister of State but this is the second time I have been at a Commencement debate without a representative from the Department responsible. At a debate here a number of weeks ago, none of the Ministers from the Department of Education and Skills - the Minister and two Ministers of State - was available to address the issue. The same is happening today. I have the response the Minister of State read out, which is fair enough, but I do not see an answer in it. I want to know whether the cap is to remain in place. Will the Minister change his position? Will he let the schools grow, which is all they are asking for? Will they still be allowed to admit only 13 students in September?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn inniu chun an ábhar tábhachtach seo a phlé. Cuireann sé sórt leadráin orm go minic agus mé ag éisteacht le polaiteoirí ag caint faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge agus ag iarraidh pointí polaitiúla a scóráil in ionad todhchaí na Gaeilge a phlé go praiticiúil agus go réalaíoch. Aontaím go huile is go hiomlán leis an méid atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit maidir leis an dualgas atá ar phobal na tíre an Ghaeilge a chur cinn. Ní bhaineann sé sin le cúrsaí polaitiúla.Baineann sé le muintir na hÉireann mar is le muintir na hÉireann an teanga. Tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go príomhá ar an bpobal. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chruthú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach agus compórdach as a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid. Aontaím go huile agus go hiomlán leis an Aire Stáit faoin méid sin.  Caithfimid a bheith macánta faoi stádas na Gaeilge sa tír seo. Tá an-chuid páistí amuigh ansin i mBaile Átha Cliath agus in áiteanna eile ar fud na tíre a bhfuil dearg-ghráin acu ar an nGaeilge. Is fuath leo an teanga agus an t-ábhar. Theip orainn mar Stát ó thaobh múineadh na teanga de. Cén fáth a bhfuil an méid sin páistí amuigh ansin atá tar éis 14 bliana a chaitheamh ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus nach bhfuil in ann dhá fhocal a chur le chéile? Cén fáth a bhfuil an méid sin daoine amuigh ansin a bhfuil an ardteistiméireacht déanta acu agus fós nach bhfuil siad compórdach a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid ar chor ar bith? Cén fáth a bhfuil an méid sin páistí ag dul ar aghaidh go dtí an dara leibhéal gan móran Gaeilge acu? Táimid ag múineadh na Gaeilge ar feadh uair a chloig gach aon lá do gach páiste idir ceithre bliana agus 13 bliana d'aois ar a laghad agus fós níl caighdeán ard Gaeilge acu. Bhí mise díreach mar an gcéanna nuair a bhí mé níos óige. D'fhreastal mé ar ghnáth-bhunscoil i Mullach Íde. Bhí an Ghaeilge mar ábhar ann agus ní raibh mórán spéise agam inti. B'fhéidir go raibh an locht ar an modh múinte nó b'fhéidir go raibh sé ormsa mar dhalta ach, chun na fírinne a rá, ní raibh spéis dá laghad agam féin ná ag aon duine eile a raibh in éineacht liom sa rang i gcúrsaí Gaeilge. B'é an fáth gur athraigh an meon a bhí agam ó thaobh na Gaeilge de ná gur fhreastal mé ar Ghaelscoil ar feadh bliana nuair a bhí mé ró-óg le dul ar aghaidh go dtí an dara leibhéal. Is é sin an t-aon fáth amháin go bhfuil Gaeilge agam anois. Ní dóigh liom gur rud conspóideach é seo a rá, ach i mo thuairim theip orainn an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh dóibh siúd nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu ó dhúchas. Caithfimid rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi sin. Ní féidir teanga a fhoghlaim ó leabhar. Ní féidir. Ní féidir teanga ar bith a fhoghlaim ó leabhar. Caithfidh an teanga a bheith ann mar theanga labhartha. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn é seo a phlé níos mó, ach tá sé thar am dúinn mar pholaiteoirí teacht le chéile, breathnú ar an gcóras oideachais atá againn ag bunleibhéal, agus a rá gur chóir dúinn bliain faoi leith a mhúineadh go huile agus go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge. Is é sin ná Gaelscoil a dhéanamh de gach aon scoil in Éirinn ar feadh bliana. Tá an méid sin ama caite againn ag múineadh na Gaeilge i ngach aon bhunscoil in Éirinn agus níl ag éirí linn, so b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn rud éigin i bhfad níos réabhlóidí a dhéanamh. B'fhéidir, mar shampla, gur chóir dúinn gach aon ábhar a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge sa tríú rang i ngach aon bhunscoil in Éirinn. Rachadh na páistí ar aghaidh go dtí an ceathrú, cúigiú agus séú rang agus beidh Gaeilge acu go nadúrtha mar theanga labhartha. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn freisin scéim a chur le chéile chun daltaí san idirbhliain sna meánscoileanna a chur chun na Gaeltachta ar feadh coicíse. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil mé ag cur béime ar dhaltaí sa Ghalltacht, mar a tugtar air, agus tá an-chuid rudaí ar siúl ag an Aire Stáit ó thaobh fhorbairt na nGaeltachtaí de. Bíonn sé ag caint faoi fhostaíocht, thithíocht agus chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, agus tá na rudaí sin thar a bheith tábhachtach chomh maith. Ag an am céanna, sílim go ndeireann daoine na rudaí céanna arís agus arís eile i ndíospóireachtaí ar nós na díospóireachta seo agus faighimid na torthaí céanna arís agus arís eile. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé maith a dhóthain do pholaiteoirí teacht isteach anseo agus a bheith ag cáineadh Fhine Gael, Fianna Fáil, an Rialtas seo ná an Rialtas a bhí ann cheana. Tá sé sin leadránach agus ní chuireann sé leis an díospóireacht. Is fadhb í seo a bhaineann leis an dearcadh atá ag mórphobal na tíre. Cinnte, baineann sé le cúrsaí polaitíochta, infheistíochta, airgid agus chuile shórt, ach is é an meon atá againn ar an teanga mar shochaí an rud is tábhachtaí. Tá fás mór millteach tagtha ar an méid Gaelscoileanna atá ann ar fud na tíre le 20 bliain anuas. Tá sé sin thar cionn ach, ag breathnú ar an scoilt sin, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé maith a dhóthain go bhfuil páistí ann sa tír seo a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus páistí nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a bheith breá sásta faoi sin. Is fíor go bhfuil mé ag díriú isteach ar an gcóras oideachais ach sin an áit gur féidir linn an méid is mó agus an difríocht is mó a dhéanamh. Tá baol ann go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina rud meánaicmeach dóibh siúd a bhfuil airgead acu chun dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht, chun a gcuid páistí a chur chuige, agus chun ranganna breise a fháil dóibh siúd a bhfuil ag iarraidh Gaeilge a dhéanamh ar ardleibhéal san ardteistiméireacht. Tá an baol sin ann. Tá a fhios agam féin ó mo thaithí sa scoil ina raibh mé mar phríomhoide agus ó mo thaithí mar mhúinteoir i scoil a bhí faoi mhíbhuntáiste, scoil bhocht, nár ceapadh go raibh an Ghaeilge tábhachtach dúinn. Ní raibh cumas labhartha ná léitheoireachta Béarla maith a dhóthain ag na daltaí. Bhí an méid sin deacrachtaí againn i lár chathrach Bhaile Átha Cliath leis na trioblóidí sóisialta éagsúla nach raibh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar phríomhaidhm na scoile. B'fhéidir nach raibh an ceart againn. Sin an fáth a cheapaim nár chóir é sin a dhéanamh a thuilleadh agus gur chóir go mbeidh sé mar chuspóir ag gach aon scoil in Éirinn cainteoirí flúirseacha líofa a chur go dtí an dara leibhéal. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn, in ionad na pointí polaitiúla sin a scóráil ar a chéile, teacht le chéile agus breathnú ar an gcóras oideachais atá againn. Cosnódh sé airgid agus bheadh orainn múinteoirí a thraenáil agus chuile shórt. Ní bheadh sé sin éasca. B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn plean cúig-bliana a chur le chéile chun an rud a chur i gcrích. Ag an am céanna, dá mbeadh gach aon rang agus ábhar múinte trí Ghaeilge i ngach aon bhunscoil in Éirinn ar feadh bliana, samhlaigh an caighdeán Gaeilge a bheadh ag na páistí ag deireadh na bliana sin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On International Women's Day the Government is to be commended for publishing the text of the proposed referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. Every day I think of the children I taught in an all-girls' school on Sheriff Street. They inspire me. Knowing that - I hope soon - with the votes of the people, they will have full bodily autonomy in the future is something that should be celebrated. As the famous song "Bread and Roses" goes, women and men will be "marching marching" to mark today's announcement by the Cabinet leading, I hope, to a referendum on 25 May. All sides of the House have a role to play in that regard. Next week the Taoiseach will visit the White House and it is appropriate that he do so. He has diplomatic responsibilities that need to be respected. I hope he will take the opportunity to speak about things which are important to Irish people. However, there will be another event held in New York next weekend. I am thankful that Mr. Colum Eastwood of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, is boycotting the White House event. Instead he will attend an event called "Irish Stand" to be held in New York to try to give voice to the real experiences of the Irish nation and the immigrant nature of Irish people who have been all over the world and who now stand shoulder to shoulder with other peoples in America who feel under threat, be they Mexican or Muslim Americans. It is important that any political representative who finds himself or herself in America next weekend use that opportunity to stand up against the racism, misogyny and homophobia emanating from the White House and not find himself or herself rubbing shoulders with those concerned at fundraisers. Instead he or she should stand in solidarity with the true meaning of what it is to be Irish - standing up for things which are universally important. What is happening in America is being reflected across the world, including in Britain with Brexit, Austria, Germany and Italy. It is not good enough for politicians to speak about equality at home and then to rub shoulders with members of the National Rifle Association, Republicans and Congressmen such as Mr. Pete King in New York who effectively is writing and supporting such xenophobic and racist policies. As we celebrate Irishness next week and what it means to be Irish, we should remember that the Irish were once at the bottom of the social ladder in America. We should, therefore, be very mindful of those who are now suffering discrimination and from rhetoric which is very hurtful and painful for them and who need the Irish to stand up for them. What they do not need is a bunch of Irish politicians in America fundraising and staying quiet when this rhetoric which is so hurtful is used.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On a point of order, the ruling of the Chair is unbelievable. I drafted the amendment in three different ways on different Stages to try to secure representation by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the governing body of the technological universities and each time it has been rejected. It is unbelievable that when one tries, with the best of intentions, to work within the process by introducing an amendment that would ensure representation for the leading trade union body in the country, which is a reasonable aspiration, it is rejected regardless of the way in which it has been drafted. I ask the Minister to respond.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I had not intended to speak so my comments will be brief and I will not speak again. I understand that yesterday's debate was quite respectful. I was impressed in particular by the comments of Senator McDowell whose contribution should be read by every intending voter in the upcoming referendum. I find the question about who we trust strange. Some people will vote against the holding of this referendum. They do not believe the people should have a say in this. They say they cannot trust politicians either. They certainly do not trust women in difficult circumstances. I do not know who is to make the determination as to what our abortion law should be. It cannot be the people because they should not be allowed to have a referendum. It cannot be politicians because we cannot trust them because they change their minds. It also cannot be women. Who is this fountain of knowledge to whom we should all turn to discuss the issue or to learn about the issue? I had not intended discussing Senator Mullen's remarks. However, I am struck by what Senator Clifford-Lee just said about born children. I understand that Senator Mullen has made 273 contributions to the Seanad since 2007 on the issue of abortion and one on child care, which he actually made in 2007.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It gives an indication of where his priorities on children lie. People are entitled to change their views. People talk about the journeys politicians have made. Again we have to return to the 12 journeys made today, the 12 journeys made yesterday and the 12 journeys that will be made tomorrow by very vulnerable upset women, who are being treated as criminals in their own country and who have to go to Britain to get for themselves what they should be getting here. I have had this discussion in my constituency office and with people who are passionately pro-life and are compassionate about this issue. I understand it comes from a position of compassion because I absolutely understand the motivations behind those on the pro-life side. I remember meeting a couple who were very upset about the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill. I said that I purely wanted a woman in a distressed situation to have a choice. They said that she had a choice and I asked them what that was. They said that she could go to Britain. As has been said we are quite happy - we have passed this in a referendum - for women to have information. We are quite happy to allow them to travel knowing exactly the reason for them travelling as long as they just do not do it here. Of course, the abortion pill has changed all that. It is appalling that somebody should have to sit in a bedroom fondling something that they had bought on the Internet and have to keep it secret for fear of criminal sanction.It is laudable that people have changed their minds on this matter. The Catholic Church has changed its mind on the whole area. There was a time when a child who died before being baptised could not be buried on sacred ground. The child would have been lumped into a hole, would not be allowed into the graveyard and, apparently, would have ended up in limbo. I understand that the Catholic Church changed its position on that. I commend the Minister. Politics is about leadership, and it is easy to lead when everyone agrees with you. It is easy to lead on an issue that is popular, but it is not easy to lead in a debate that is difficult. I take my hat off to the Minister, as he has allowed himself in his period in the Oireachtas to listen. He moved from what I understand was his original position, in which he was not necessarily convinced of the need to legislate for the X case, to one in which he has allowed himself to discuss the matter within his own party and the Oireachtas. He is the most convincing advocate for this referendum on what is a necessary change. What he is doing is historic and he will get absolute support from the Labour Party for it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«When someone like the Minister, in the articulate way that he does it and by showing the journey that he has gone through, is willing to take the flak and debate with those who disagree with him within his own party and across the Oireachtas, I have significant admiration for him as a politician and a man. We are coming to the close of this Oireachtas debate. I look forward to it going out into the wider sphere and for the people to have their say. I hope that the referendum will take place on 25 May. People say that politicians cannot be trusted, but the wonderful thing about this country is that, every number of years, we get the chance to vote for people to enter the Oireachtas and make decisions. If abortion legislation is a reason for someone to vote or not vote for a candidate, then vote or do not vote. That is the beauty of living in a democracy. To deny people the chance to vote in this referendum is unjustified. There is a considerable amount of hypocrisy around this matter. It is easier to run from the issue. If we were to hold a secret ballot of Members of the Oireachtas, those who have shown their cards to be on the pro-life side might actually vote a different way. However, that is not the case with the Minister. He has shown leadership, strength and courage, and I want to salute him.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With studs up.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the opportunity to speak. The Minister of State may look at Senators speaking passionately on the matter of councillors' rights with a small bit of cynicism. I would not necessarily blame him as the vast majority of Senators are here because we got elected by councillors, in the main. We did the circuit and we went around to all the different meetings. To be frank, the vast majority of councillors to whom I spoke were more concerned with national issues, although there were always concerns about the terms and conditions of the job at hand. Many people have spoken on this and I do not really want to repeat what has been said. Before I came into politics, there was a general perception of councillors that was quite negative. Being from Dublin and having gone through the 1980s and the tribunals, the assumption was that a councillor's reputation was not great. I was elected to a local authority in 2004 and I was in the north inner city. I am very taken by Senator Black's comments on the responsibilities that councillors had in the north inner city, where I was elected. My mind was blown first because party whip and affiliation are well down the list of priorities when it comes to being a councillor. It is not like being in here or in the Dáil and there is not the same adversarial nature of party politics on the council. Councillors genuinely work across parties and there is not a strict whip system. If one goes to a public meeting, councillors generally work hand in glove in trying to get matters resolved. Councillors deal with matters that are very sensitive, such as parks, playgrounds and the public space, which is very important. I first ran for election because the library closest to where I taught in Sheriff Street did not open on a Saturday for some bizarre reason. I learned that was because the local authority decided it should not open on Saturdays. When I was elected we engaged with other parties, councillors and the city management and after a period the library was opened on Saturdays. It is that public space that they defend and advocate for and it is extremely important, as are the committees on which councillors sit.I was unable to sit on a remarkable number of committees because I was teaching at the same time as I was a councillor. They included the local drugs task force. I appreciate the comments made by Senator Conway-Walsh on the rural-urban divide and I accept that the comparison between rural and urban councillors is not necessarily fair considering the distances the former must travel. However, in various parts of the country, including cities, local authority members must attend crucial meetings dealing with life and death issues, for example, meetings of local drugs task forces. Councillors have to become experts on everything overnight, from planning and drugs to traffic and ramps. Members of the education and training boards, previously known as vocational educational committees, must become experts in education. Councillors clearly take their responsibilities extremely seriously and the concern is that the only people who will be attracted to run for local election are those who have time on their hands or enough money to allow them to do the job. It would be a dangerous development if the only people attracted to local politics were those with time and money. A large number of members of Dublin City Council resigned during my time as a councillor from 2004 until 2011. Most resignations were not related to political concerns or the reasons that Senators or Deputies resign but genuinely because some of those who ran for election in 2004 and 2009 did not realise the workload they would have and what was expected of them. A great deal is expected of local councillors. Following the resignations, those who were co-opted to take the vacant seats also found the job very difficult. In fairness to the Minister of State, he gave a commitment on this issue at a meeting of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party. Perhaps Senators will be invited to the next such meeting. He also established a review with an independent chair, which will report by the end of the year. I am willing to accept that commitment and I will support the Minister of State in his endeavours in this regard. I look forward to the findings of the group. I will give him a fair wind by assuming the review will come up with the goods by the end of year. I do not need to rehearse the arguments made by previous speakers. The jibes and jokes made about councillors are hurtful, for example, when they are asked how many brown envelopes they received in the previous week. Before I entered public life and ran for election, I made similar types of jokes. I subsequently observed that, regardless of political background or party, local representatives worked thanklessly, day in, day out on nitty-gritty issues and were always willing to engage with other political representatives. During my time on Dublin City Council, I joined the four other councillors in the north inner city, Christy Burke, Thomas Stafford, Emer Costello and Mick Rafferty, at many meetings across the north inner city which were attended by more councillors than residents. Sometimes people do not realise the commitment, time, dedication, knowledge and expertise councillors give to their work. They are supposedly part-time and if they are at a financial disadvantage and find they cannot keep going, they will resign which is a very difficult decision to make when one has secured a mandate and then finds one cannot continue to represent one's electorate. If Members of the Oireachtas were honest, we would admit that between 80% and 90% of the work we do is council related. Who are at the front line of the housing crisis? It is councillors who must deal with local authority waiting lists and so forth. For this reason, having love bombed the Minister of State just now and another Fine Gael Party Minister yesterday, I was disappointed by the communication circulated by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to local authority members concerning their ability to make representations on planning applications. That was a bad, unfortunate and regrettable move because councillors know their areas well and are entitled to make representations on planning applications. Having said that, I agree with all the sentiments expressed by Senators on the work done by councillors. I am concerned, however, by the number of councillors who are resigning and the type of person who will be in a position to run for local office in future. We will support the review mechanism proposed by the Minister of State in the hope that it will produce the goods.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join others to extend the Labour Party's sympathy to the family of Big Tom. It is fair to say he was a music legend in his part of the world, but also nationally and internationally. I met him on a number of occasions at Monaghan GAA matches and I think that is where he got his nickname as he was a formidable midfielder in his club football days. I pass on the Labour Party's condolences to the McBride family. I wish to raise two issues. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the 42 new projects? This was welcome news for many people across Dublin, in particular, and in my own part of the world who are seeking an Educate Together second level school in Dublin 13. The Minister for Education and Skills might come in and discuss that and other projects about which there is concern that they will not be progressed as a result of that announcement. The second issue for the Minister for Education and Skills involves concerns about the imminent closure of a Traveller school. It is not a school for Travellers, but 100% of the intake are Travellers. It just happens to be that way. They have been told only last week that they are to close immediately in June, which will have a detrimental impact on the students in the senior cycle.I contend that the school needs to be phased out rather than closed overnight in June and I would like the Minister to come in to discuss that. I had sought a Commencement debate on it but have not been successful in getting one. I will raise two issues for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The first relates to the strategic housing development process trying to fast-track housing. I understand the reasons behind it because of the nature of the housing crisis but we need to discuss the effect the strategic housing development process is having on zoning across Dublin city and wider afield. It is effectively open season for development on Z15 lands, in particular, institutional lands and schools. In many communities, that might be a positive but in others it is not. The protection of Z15 must be considered by the Government because An Bord Pleanála is not taking it into account. Lastly, I need to talk about the Shanowen shakedown protest that took place outside Leinster House this afternoon. I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, went out and spoke to the students, which is to her credit. However, the rising rent costs for students in this city and across the country is troubling and the students have recommended that an amendment be made to legislation to facilitate a rent cap for students. Rent increases of that nature are detrimental to their capacity to have a student life and proceed with their studies. In fairness, the Minister of State did come out and talk to them. I would like an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate. The issue is about St. Thomas's special school in Clonshaugh. It is a small school, with a small enrolment, and a school that nobody really believes has a future, although that is not the issue at question here. It is a school where, through circumstance, all the pupils enrolled are Traveller boys. A decision was reached recently and communicated to the patron of the school that it is to close with immediate effect in June, not to be phased out over a number of years. I do not believe in segregated education and do not think many people do. I do not believe boys should be separated from girls. I do not believe children of different religions should be separated from each other in schools. I do not believe children from families with financial advantage should be separated from children from families without that financial advantage and I certainly do not believe that Travellers should be educated separately from other children. However, there is a way of changing that. If this school is to close, and the principal, the staff and the school community appreciate the need for that to happen, then it should be done in a compassionate manner. There is a handful of young men in the senior cycle of the school, or approaching the senior cycle, who would be severely affected by this closure. I do not know if the Minister of State can remember when he was 16 but I remember when I was 16. If we had been told we had to leave the school we were in to go to another school, it would have been pretty difficult for us to do that, and we are not members of a much-discriminated against minority. We are also not members of a minority that has a tradition of having difficulty in progressing in mainstream, formal education. The issue here is that there are a number of young men who do not really see themselves staying in education if this rug is pulled from under them. The issue in St. Thomas's is not that the school should not close; I think everybody believes it should close. The issue is that it should be done with compassion and understanding for the young men who it will affect most profoundly, namely, the young men in fifth year and in third year. I could understand if the school was told not to take any more students in September. I could also understand if the Department said it would do this over the course of a year or two years, particularly for those young men who will face the leaving certificate next year. Despite the best will in the world, what will happen as a result of this situation is that young men who were going to do their leaving certificate in a year or two years will now not do it. Understanding that the school has to close, what I need to know from the Minister of State is that it can be done over two years to allow these young men to continue in their education in St. Thomas's and to allow a calm and compassionate transition for other students to other educational facilities. We are not asking for the world. We are not asking to reverse the decision. We are just asking that the decision be phased, rather than immediate. For a school to be told in April that it is to close in June is, I would contest, very unusual. I do not think a school of a different character would get a message in April that it is closing in June for good. That is the message from the school community. These are vulnerable young people in mainstream education and they are doing their best. I would ask that the Department would give them that small bit of leeway, not to close the doors of the school overnight, but to do it over a more prolonged period.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I listened to the Minister of State's reply. I appreciate that the intention of the Department is to promote integration. I believe in that and look forward to the day when we have more Travellers in the teaching profession and as role models in the educational sphere. My fear is that in years to come, there will be three, four, five or six young men who will point to the closure of the school as the reason they do not have a leaving certificate. Tusla and the Department will do their best to help these students transition to another mainstream setting but my fear is that for the want of a bit of leeway - a year or two - in allowing the students to stay in their current setting, the educational system could lose them completely. I again ask the Minister of State to pass on my concerns to the Minister and the Department about these young men, the danger presented by the immediate closure of the school and the message that sends to them. Nobody is arguing - I certainly do not - that Traveller-only schools or educational settings are the way to go. They are not. They are not healthy or progressive but I suggest that phasing in this closure is in the best interests of those young men, which must surely be our collective goal.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Norris should read his emails, a Chathaoirligh.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A couple of months ago I raised the issue of posters pertaining to this referendum. I made the comment that perhaps it would be best for all sides if neither "Yes" nor "No" posters were erected because of the sensitive nature of the issue at hand. I feel that even more strongly now. Walking past Leinster House today, I was greeted by an incredibly offensive and insensitive banner. Members of An Garda Síochána told me that there is a very long and complicated process involved in complaining about such an offensive banner. The posters around the city and the country feature statements that do not have to be verified or fact checked. In fact, there is nobody whose job is to fact check or verify statements written on referendum posters. As the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, signed the order for the referendum quite early, we have a two-month campaign rather than the one-month one we were anticipating. My suggestion to the Cathaoirleach is that the Minister should come in and discuss this matter. There should be some mechanism for overseeing or verifying statements or slogans used in referendum campaigns. One such slogan has no basis in fact whatsoever, namely, the claim that one in five pregnancies in Britain ends in a termination. There is no basis for that declaration whatsoever but it is on every lamp-post in the land.  I spoke to a woman who rang the Labour Party offices and who last year was in the traumatic situation of having to deal with a fatal foetal abnormality. Of course, she had to leave this country because of our archaic legislation and constitutional amendments on pregnancy. She was highly traumatised by the entire situation and now has a poster outside her door that is extremely upsetting to her. We arrived and stuck a poster on the same pole to countermand or balance the situation, because of how offensive that poster was to her. Can we have the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment before this House? There is a loophole in legislation here. It is nobody's fault but we need to rectify it. If a referendum is taking place and posters are being erected, people should not be able to tell lies. One should not be allowed to display deeply and gratuitously offensive messaging and posters outside the Houses of the Parliament of the Irish Republic in a huge and graphic style. It is offensive to me, it should be offensive to every Member of this House and we should be in a position to do something about it. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for attending. I am raising the issue of access to St. Michael's House in Dublin 9 for day service users. These people are having difficulty accessing transport. The Department is well aware of this issue. In a presentation made to me last week, however, I was told that it had 788 adult service users who are transported to day services every day, of whom 200 are supported by St. Michael's House drivers and escorts, 120 are transported by Vantastic, 96 are transported by residential house staff and bus, 41 are transported by day service staff and bus, 35 are transported by contract taxis, 38 are transported by family members - with 18 such arrangements being unsustainable - and 258 are transported by public transport, some with support. A total of 435 of these individuals live with residential supports from St. Michael's House. The Minister of State will appreciate that these are very vulnerable users of the service for whom transport is essential. If they do not have transport, the service will not be accessible to them. I will outline some of their concerns and some of the deficiencies relating to the service. A total of eight service users who live at home cannot access the service because they have no transport. This is a serious situation for these eight individuals. A total of 38 individuals are being transported by family members and, as already stated, 18 of these arrangements are not sustainable. An issue of equity arises here. St. Michael's House also supports an ageing group of people with increasingly complex needs. The average age of primary care givers there is also increasing. Twenty individuals supported in St. Michael's House residential services are on a waiting list for transport, which impacts on residential service staff. A total of 325.5 staff hours could be released from the roster if an effective transport service was delivered. The issue of transport to and from St. Michael's House to allow individuals to access its services has been ongoing for quite a number of years. There is no cheap solution and providing transport is expensive. What is even more expensive, however, is the compounded vulnerability, isolation, loneliness and sense of despair experienced by the families who need these services for their loved ones. The sense of isolation because of a lack of transport is quite acute. While I know the Minister of State and his Department will be looking at both the cost and the bottom line, I contend that the cost of not taking action will be quite profound. I want to be constructive. I know there are no easy solutions that the Minister of State can offer today but I would ask that he and other Ministers, who I know have been in contact with and have met representatives from St. Michael's House, can try to find an equitable and sustainable solution. A number of people clearly need this service and cannot access it because of the lack of transport to which I refer. The families of the eight individuals I mentioned will be impacted upon as well because of the range of challenges their loved ones face. I plead with the Minister of State to look at the situation and provide transport for these individuals. They are very vulnerable and need the service and to be able to access it. Without transport, they will continue to be isolated. We are in a much better financial position than previously and we have the resources to do things we were unable to do in the past. I ask the Minister of State and the Department to prioritise this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With the greatest respect, it does not really do much, particularly for the eight service users who are at home and cannot access the service because they have no transport or the 18 individuals who are transported by family members, something which St. Michael's House has indicated is not sustainable. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the answer he has provided, particularly in the context of these service users, who are isolated and who cannot use the service. I understand the constraints the Minister of State is under when he comes to the House with a script but we have a service for vulnerable people, a number of whom are at home and cannot access it because of lack of transport. The Minister of State's answer does not really give me, St. Michael's House or the families of these eight people and the 18 individuals whose current transport arrangements are made by family members and are unsustainable any comfort. Can the Department not meet representatives from St. Michael's House and find sustainable transport solutions for those 26 individuals?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator can go ahead.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise two issues. What the women of Ireland need now is leadership from these Houses. I know that politics has a bad name, but politics can do much good in the coming days. I am delighted that Senator Norris mentioned the name of the woman at the heart of this scandal, Vicky Phelan. People have asked for this not to be made a political football and then have immediately engaged in political football. I do not believe that the people of Ireland need to see one side of the House point a finger at the other side of the House. We should point the finger, collectively, at ourselves and ask what we can do better for the women of Ireland. I doubt that anybody would disagree that if this was a service exclusively for men, this would never happen. We continuously fail women in this country and that must be recognised. I also wish to raise the issue of sport. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to discuss sport in general and the capacity of children to play sport in the context of the accessibility of local playing fields. I am a member of Scoil Uí Chonaill GAA club. It was a delight for us to see a member of the club, Hannah Leahy, who is vice-captain of the Dublin ladies minor team, be named the player of the game on Sunday when the team won the Leinster championship. We are very proud of her, as are her family. While many of us in the House enjoy GAA and sport, we see what is happening to many of the playing pitches across this city and further afield with regard to rezoning and commercial development, including what is happening in the Na Fianna club in Glasnevin. I would appreciate the opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister with responsibility for sport about the availability and accessibility of playing pitches and how we can facilitate clubs and young children to enjoy sporting endeavour into the future. With the building or construction boom back there is more pressure on lands in institutional use in colleges and schools across the State and, due to major infrastructure plans, clubs such as Na Fianna are under increasing scrutiny and pressure. That debate would be timely and I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I concur with my colleague and I also welcome the Minister to the House. I appreciate the work that she and her officials have done in this regard. I completely agree with her. What she has outlined is not the intention of our Bill in any way. The intention is to bring parents under the compassionate arm of the State rather than having them end up in a courtroom. I appreciate the difficulty the Minister's drafters will have in differentiating between a child not enrolled in a school and one who is. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that Tusla and the agencies of the State can deal compassionately with all children within the primary school enrolment system, particularly four and five year olds, and that they can be interacted with, encouraged and empowered. Nobody wants to see the parents of any child in a courtroom situation. It is a failure on everybody's part if it comes to that. We want to have that compassionate engagement and interaction from the agencies of the State for four and five year olds enrolled in school in order to correct poor patterns of behaviour at the earliest stage so that they do not compound and embed themselves into a much bigger problem later on. I appreciate the difficulty that the Minister's drafters will have. We will support her at every step along the way. Perhaps in time a more comprehensive Act may be needed to deal with this whole range of issues over a period of time. From the Labour Party's perspective, we are absolutely determined to work with the Minister on this.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Acting Chairman's indulgence. I thank the Minister and I reiterate that I hope nobody thinks that the intention of this Bill is stick rather than carrot. There are principals like myself in my former occupation who had the situation where they could only deal with the agents of the State, the National Educational Welfare Board as it was then and Tusla now, if a child was over six years of age. If there is a child in the school with very poor attendance patterns, for whatever reason, there was not the opportunity to refer that child because the legislation provided for children between the ages of six and 16. The intention of this Bill is not to hurt families. It is not to try and create difficulty between the school and a family. It is intended that a school can work with a family to address these poor behaviour patterns and that they can be empowered to do so by legislation. That is the ethos behind the Bill. I am delighted the Minister has accepted the Bill, is taking it on board that we have reached Committee Stage and can progress it. I mention a child who is enrolled and who is dependent on adults advocating for him or her. When one is 16 or 17 years of age, and in the education system, one is in a position to advocate for oneself and it is a different conversation, but when a child is four or five years of age, he or she needs adults to back him or her. Children need their parents, family and whole school community to back them. I am delighted that people in this House are backing those children and the Minister is too. I appreciate the Minister's support.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Cathaoirleach for the indulgence of the House for an amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 12 before No. 1.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit recognised schools, subject to certain exceptions, from charging admission or enrolment fees or from otherwise seeking contributions from parents towards meeting the costs and expenses incurred in providing education at that school; and to provide for connected matters.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next Tuesday. Can I say a few short words on it?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sure that the Minister will agree that in the political sphere we operate it is time to move beyond business as usual when it comes to political barbs, finger-pointing and point-scoring. The issue at hand is far too serious. The Labour Party absolutely stands with the Minister and accepts his bona fides. In his efforts to deal with this matter his interaction with our party and with other parties has been to his credit. Nobody could suggest that he does not treat this with the absolutely seriousness it deserves, as he is doing his absolute best to ensure this does not happen again. The Labour Party has been quite strong on the need for a commission of investigation, and I believe the Minister has moved his own position towards that. That is to be welcomed. We feel strongly that no woman affected by this issue should in any way be liable for any medical costs whatsoever, and that no woman involved in this situation should have to put her hand in her pocket, nor should her family have to put their hands into their pockets.  On the overall structure of the HSE, it was suggested last night in the media that part of the problem with the HSE currently is that, in the effort by the last Government - which I was a part of - to abolish the HSE, the board was dispensed with. As a result of the board not being in place, one of the obvious corporate governance checks and balances that would be expected in an institution such as the HSE is no longer there. Subsequently, when the CEO of the HSE is going about his or her daily business, the lack of a board being there as a check and balance in that institution is a glaring omission. I am asking that the Minister discusses that with us this evening. When the HSE was established it was said that politics provides the policy and the HSE deals with the delivery. In the delivery there must be political accountability.  I would appreciate if the Minister would address those points. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will raise two issues, if I may, and call for two debates. First, I had a meeting on Monday in the Department of Health with grieving parents of a young Irish boy, Gavin Coyne, who passed away in Newcastle last year with a heart complaint. The care that we provide for children with heart issues needs to be examined and the way that we care for parents who have to deal with this situation and who have to seek treatment abroad needs to be further investigated because the treatment that this family and their son got left much to be desired. We made progress at the meeting with high-ranking officials but a political discussion needs to take place in this Chamber as to how we invest in that area, how we can support children with heart complaints and how we can support families because there is still a discussion to be had in that way. A young Irish child died, not in Ireland but abroad, and we need to have a conversation about that. I hope the Leader can facilitate a conversation with the Minister for Health on how we send children abroad for certain operational procedures. The second issue I want to raise is the issue of mental health. I note the comments of the Ombudsman for Children who is quite critical of the State's response to children's mental health issues. We had some quite disgusting comments over the course of the most recent referendum where Members of this House stated that mental health was not real health. In my constituency, in the past month we have had two instances at two DART stations where young people have lost their lives. I witnessed a vigil in Harmonstown DART station attended by young people who were traumatised by their friend, the person whom they loved and knew, taking his own life at Harmonstown DART station. Flowers and candles were left. This is an epidemic that we in this House all know far too well. As public representatives, we must have a response to this. I ask the Leader to facilitate a conversation with the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health because where I live, the area that I care passionately about, at local DART stations people are literally ending their lives. This cannot be a situation that is normalised. What is most worrying about it is that it has not seemed to have got any traction or much comment. I call for that debate in this House as a matter of urgency.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House. While I broadly welcome the Bill, I would like to make some comments on it. When we are making provisions that relate to religion, I always think the constitutional reality we have means we can do no more than tinker with the issue. That is why the Labour Party is arguing that the Citizens' Assembly should reconvene to discuss the relationship between the church and the State when it comes to the provision of education in Ireland. It makes absolutely no sense whatever to me, on any level, that we should separate children on the basis of gender or religion. I do not think it stands up to any examination as being good for children. Unfortunately, what is best for children is the last thing to be considered when education policy is being drawn up. We look at what is best for patrons and sometimes look at what is best for teacher unions, but we rarely look at what is best for children. We hope the Minister will advocate for the Citizens' Assembly to discuss this matter. I would like to speak about enrolment fees. We have proposed a Bill that would ban voluntary contributions. We will have an opportunity to discuss this issue at greater length at some time in the future. I commend what the Minister is doing with regard to the baptism barrier. There are restrictions on how much he can achieve in this space. As others have said, this is the best possible effort that can be made in the current circumstances. The Labour Party will support the Minister in this endeavour. I have a serious grievance with one area of the Bill. It appears that the fee-paying school sector has an open door at Cabinet level. The proposed new section 62(9) of the Education Act 1998, as set out in section 9 of this Bill, will provide that "Subsection (7)(e)(vi) shall not apply to selection criteria based on a student’s connection to the school by virtue of ... a parent or grandparent of the student concerned having previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to that criterion does not exceed 25 per cent of the available places as set out in the school's annual admission notice for the school year concerned". I know the Minister will say that the relevant figure has been 100% up to now. This legislation was delayed under the previous Government because of a row about this provision. The then Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, provided that the figure should be 0%. The Fine Gael response was that it should be 25%. We need to be perfectly clear about what we are saying here. This Bill proposes that all schools should be allowed to provide a certain number of places to the children of parents or grandparents of past pupils. This automatically means that a child whose parents, or potentially grandparents, did not go to secondary school - by the way, I am one of those people - will be at a disadvantage where a school is oversubscribed. In my opinion, this is elitist tripe. It potentially overrides the rights of vulnerable and marginalised groups.If one is a Traveller child whose parents did not go to secondary school, if one is from a disadvantaged background and one's parents or grandparents did not go to secondary school, if one is not from the local area or if one is not from the country, how can one apply on the same basis? This is a demand of the fee-paying sector, which wants to have a royal blue line of succession running through their schools for fundraising purposes. They want to be in a position to fundraise from the children and grandchildren of past pupils. As with many things in the case of this Government, when the fee-paying schools sector comes knocking, the door is flung right open. We can talk about the Wesley pitch or the fact that the fee-paying sector is exempt from the provision of special needs classes. While we support elements of the Bill in relation to the baptism barrier, want a further conversation on the Citizens' Assembly and the relationship between church and state, will progress legislation on voluntary contributions and appreciate the mechanisms within the Bill to deal with fees, we oppose this section absolutely. We will oppose it tooth and nail and will call votes on it left, right and centre because it is odious, elitist and wrong. It is only included at the behest of the private fee-paying schools sector, which has been campaigning and lobbying for it for a long time. It is the very reason the last Government did not produce this legislation. There was a row between the parties over this provision. It is outrageous that a school should be allowed to keep 25% of its student body for children and grandchildren - I repeat "grandchildren" - of past pupils. On all the other measures, the Minister will have our support and we will do our best. I have great sympathy for parents raising their children through the Irish language and who wish to have their children educated through Irish. It is something we have to work on together and we can find solutions. The Minister will have no difficulty finding practical solutions from our end of things. However, this particular provision must be called out for what it is. It is intensive lobbying by a particular elitist sector in Irish society, which always seems to get its way. As the former principal of a DEIS school, I wish we had the same "in" for the most disadvantaged students in the country which the fee-paying sector seems to have. They always seem to get what they want. In terms of this section, the Minister will get no agreement from the Labour Party. We will ensure that there is vote after vote on this and I encourage other Members of the House to support me and my party in that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will second that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell has been critical of my use of my phone in this Chamber so I want to make sure I build bridges by seconding her amendment to the Order of Business, like a good student.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I hope that is done now. On the question of housing another debate with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government would be beneficial and important.Senator Humphreys and I have discussed the importance of reinstating the rent-to-buy scheme. It was available ten years ago and allowed people to raise enough money for a deposit while still renting. I refer to that stuck generation who still live at home even though they are in their 20s, 30s and 40s. The scheme allowed for the entire rent paid for the previous three years to go towards a deposit. It meant one did not have a situation where people who were renting had to try to save for a deposit at the same time. Before the economic crash, the rent-to-buy scheme worked for quite a number of people and I believe the scheme should be reintroduced. The Labour Party will include such a proposal as part of its pre-budget submission. We should proactively work with city and county councils to reintroduce the scheme.  I want to refer to US border policy and the current practice of separating families at the southern border of the United States. A number of years ago I called Donald Trump a fascist. One thing that clearly identifies a person as being fascist is to pick on a very vulnerable group, dehumanise them, blame them for everything and treat them in the most appalling manner. Sadly, such disgusting political behaviour has begun to spread because recently, the Italian Government issued statements about the Roma community who live in Italy. We should not be surprised about what has happened at the southern border of the US because it follows a travel ban, loads of rhetoric and the fact that Donald Trump has called illegal immigrants animals. I have to hand the invitation that all Members of the Oireachtas received by post from the chargé d'affaires of the United States Embassy. Of course there is no US ambassador to Ireland because that country has not bothered to give us one. The chargé d'affaires has invited us all to drink - I assume champagne - and to eat sausage rolls on 3 July to celebrate US Independence Day on 4 July. Bizarrely, the event is entitled "United We Rock". Earlier we had a briefing with an American immigration lawyer, Ms Fiona McEntee, as well as Senator Lawless, who obviously also feels passionately about this issue. Earlier, there was representation from every political party in the House, which I was delighted to see. I am very taken by the strong statement made by the Tánaiste and by the motion tabled in this House by Fianna Fáil. I believe it is time for us to collectively and with one voice, given what is happening on the southern border of the United States, to refuse point blank to attend the reception and tell the chargé d'affaires the reasons we are not attending it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be a small gesture in response to a big issue. We can all see what is happening with Brexit, which has anti-immigration sentiments. We also have Trump and we have seen what has happened in Italy. In addition, after what has happened recently with our referendum and the referendum that took place a number of years ago, people look to us to stand for something better. Let us consider our history of coffin ships and Irish people being forced to emigrate to places all around the world, we must tell the chargé d'affaires in the American Embassy that no Member of the Oireachtas will attend his reception for 4 July.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 35:In page 24, line 9, to delete “school;” and substitute the following:“school, or by virtue of his or her family relationship with a member of the board or a teacher or other member of the staff of the school;”.The amendment speaks to an issue within the Bill which gives permanence-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I accept that. The amendment relates to the provision within the Bill that allows for children, grandchildren or family members of past pupils to be given a level of priority when seeking access to an oversubscribed school. There are two amendments on this in two different sections that relate to it but it is very much the same point. This particular section makes the point about family members. It is connected with another section in the Bill. It is the same point I am trying to make. It is connected to the children and grandchildren issue which I will raise later. There is a provision in the Bill that 25% of places in schools can be reserved for children or grandchildren of past pupils. The Minister knows my point of view on this because I have raised it before. I do not feel it is right that children who are trying to access a school on the same basis as everyone else should be disadvantaged because they are not a family member of a past pupil. It is not an unreasonable proposition. It is completely unreasonable that it is in the Bill. It places certain children at a disadvantage to other children. Nobody wants to have an oversubscribed school. Everybody wishes we could have places for everybody. In that scenario, what the Minister is proposing is that family members of past pupils should have priority. We are not talking about siblings. We have no difficulty with siblings. We are talking about children and grandchildren as is outlined in the Bill. Inevitably, if one's parents did not go to second-level school, as some people in the Chamber might be familiar with, or if one's grandparents did not go to second level school, which I am familiar with, one is at a disadvantage. If one is a Traveller child or does not come from the immediate area or from the country, one is also at a disadvantage. The Minister may deny it but I will say anyway that these measures are in the Bill at the behest of the fee-paying private school sector because it has been lobbying every political party in the Oireachtas extensively for many years on the issue. The sector feels strongly about keeping a royal bloodline of succession going through its schools to maintain the old school network of fundraising. It means that sons and grandsons of former students of certain fee-paying boys' schools or daughters or granddaughters of certain fee-paying girls' schools can still have a connection with the school and still fundraise and all the rest of it. It is elitist, odious and wrong. It is only there at the behest of that sector. I remind the Minister - he was at the Cabinet table - that the Labour Party vehemently opposed this measure under Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and tried to delete it. There was a compromise of 10% but this measure is the reason the legislation stalled and did not get past the Cabinet in the last Government. It is the reason we are only discussing it now. While we all have to accept the constitutional reality about religion, etc., and there are measures in this Bill to try to change that, it is absolutely unconscionable that we would again allow the fee-paying private school sector to walk through the open door it seems to have with Cabinet members and get what it wants in this Bill. It is absolutely wrong. The Minister probably knows it is wrong. If he goes with this he will not get the emails from people in that sector. Those people are very powerful and influential and they normally get what they want. In this Oireachtas we should facilitate a Bill that speaks to the majority. I think the majority of people in this country did not have a parent or grandparent who went to the same school and they would find the measure elitist and wrong. I am interested to hear the Minister's comments as I will press the amendment. It will be interesting to see how other people react to it and I will call out those who do not support this. I feel more strongly about this measure than anything else in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I defer to the southsider on that score.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was wondering when she was going to refer to the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join the calls for a debate on education, in particular, teacher shortages and pay equalisation. I understand there is an ongoing conversation between the teacher unions and the Minister for Education and Skills and the Department. To refresh the memories of some Members in this Chamber who may have forgotten, pay inequality started on 1 January 2011, prior to the 2011 general election. It is high time the House had a conversation about teacher shortages and pay inequality and the associated issue of correcting examination papers. As there is low morale in the teaching profession as matters stand, this House needs to show leadership by finding solutions. It comes down to pay and respect. I encourage all Senators to advise their constituents or people with whom they have connections that the Department of Health has an ongoing consultation process this month on the possession of illegal drugs for personal use. It is a welcome survey which can be completed quickly. It feeds into the national conversation about the potential for the decriminalisation of drug use. Having held a public meeting last night in Donnycarney with Fr. Peter McVerry, Senator Lynn Ruane and Ms Anna Quigley of CityWide, the public is interested in changing our approach. The change in approach in Portugal 15 years ago has led to a 50% reduction in the number of people involved in heroin addiction programmes and a 75% reduction in the number of deaths by fatal overdose. Were that to happen in Ireland, there would be a major change in the addiction problem. We have significant addiction issues, with the third highest fatal overdose rate in Europe. If the Cathaoirleach will permit me to do so, I congratulate the GAA on its decision this morning to hold the game between Kildare and Mayo in Newbridge on Saturday night. Some may criticise Senators for raising GAA matters in the House, but the GAA is an important organisation in the country. The decision that Kildare will play the game in Newbridge on Saturday night is a very good one. I congratulate Kildare, in particular, for taking a stand and winning out. One never knows - that level of enthusiasm and motivation might continue with Kildare's efforts on the field. As a Dub, we will beat whoever comes out of the game.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We need video assisted refereeing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House again. I join other Members in congratulating Senator Craughwell on the introduction of this Bill, which has facilitated a conversation in this House on the nature of digital safety in the classroom and in schools. It is very easy to support this Bill because of the intent behind it. One hears stories from teachers and parents on the nature of cyberbullying, the pressures on young children, the prevalence of self-harm and suicide and the dehumanising bullying that takes place. It is quite terrifying that smartphones and other means of accessing the Internet are facilitating access to pornography and gambling, thereby causing all sorts of social problems and difficulties in young lives. We live in a country in which children are self-harming and killing themselves because of bullying. Before the smartphone was invented, bullying used to happen on the toilet wall in school, but now people have found a different mechanism to be hurtful. We do not deny that the emotions transmitted through smartphones and digital devices are causing pain, destruction and death. We need to consider how best to regulate the use of these devices and deal with the situation. We should not be under any illusions regarding the powers and dangers of these devices. If someone awoke from a 30-year coma and walked around the streets of Dublin today, he or she might notice differences in fashion trends, cars and buildings, but the biggest difference he or she would notice after being unconscious for 30 years would be that people are walking around with things in their hands that they are unable to take their eyes off. I think that is the biggest single change that has happened in the last 30 years. It is not just young people who behave in this way. I have a new app on my phone that counts how many hours I am spending on the device each day. I freely admit that I was shocked to learn how often I flip it open and engage with it. As everyone in public life, including the Members of this House, will know, it is easy for people to send us negative or abusive messages in various ways.How do we protect our children from that? It is far too easy for policy makers to say schools are the answer to all our problems. Children do not live in schools. When I was in the classroom, I recoiled from the suggestion that the teacher or school was the answer to any social ill. There was an attitude that, whether the problem was teenage sex, drugs, alcohol, violence, video games or joyriding, if children were taught properly in school, everything would be fine. In fairness to teachers, their job is to deliver a wide curriculum at primary and second levels. They do their best to care for their children but the children do not live in the schools. In my time in the classroom, we did our best to encourage children to make the right choices but once they step outside the door of the school, it is a different reality and environment, the expectations on them are different and they respond differently to those around them. Children will say the right thing at the right time in the classroom but the reality on the street is very different. If the education system in Ireland really had that much influence over children’s behaviour, mass attendance might be much bigger and the Irish language proficiency of Irish children might be much better. Teachers have a limited level of influence on children which should not be overstated. That does not mean schools should do nothing but if we are trying to solve a social ill, we cannot just say the school is the answer. It is part of the answer. The answer lies with the school and wider communities, parents, politics and the media. Any adult is part of the answer. It is wrong to simply state that the school is the one place where this can be rectified. Is legislation the right way to go on this issue? I have tossed and turned and reflected on it and, while I absolutely understand the intent behind the Bill, I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter. Circulars are sent to schools in the Irish education system to guide them on how best to deal with situations and the children under their care. I am yet to be convinced that the introduction of legislation is the way to go. My party and I would be happy to support the Bill in terms of it facilitating this debate in the House but we are very interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to the Bill because there is a balance to be struck between the ability of a school to run itself in the best way it sees fit and the responsibility of the State to protect children in conjunction with the school. However, let us be clear that children spend most of their time outside school. This week, schools will break for the summer and children will have two months during which they will not come into any contact with their school but digital devices will be readily available to them at all hours of the day and night. There are significant responsibilities on the corporate sector and those selling these devices in terms of the age of persons to whom they are sold, the types of app available to children and the types of interaction children are allowed to have through various social media outlets. We have allowed the corporate sector to run riot without regulation in many respects and whenever we ask it to step in the response has been less than impressive. Members of this Oireachtas have received all sorts of death and rape threats but we have a facility to respond in the House and as adults. I can only imagine what a child would feel if such threats were communicated to him or her through his or her phone. Senator Craughwell is to be congratulated for bringing his absolutely well-intentioned and well-meaning Bill to the Oireachtas. This is a very useful and healthy debate. Every parent in the country dreads their child reaching an age when he or she asks for a phone. We have yet to resolve the question of how best to empower the school community and parents to adequately deal with that. I am not yet convinced that the Bill is the way to do so but the motivations behind the Bill will go some way to resolving the issue. I am interested to hear the response of the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Buttimer can speak for himself.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. I find his contribution interesting. My problem with the Fine Gael-led Government's view on the world is that it wants to be a Government not for all of the people but for about 40% or 50% of the people. There is this idea it wants to convince people they are over-taxed and that, as the Minister of State said in his statement, public services are in need of reform, that we spend €60 billion on public services and this is too much. That kind of rhetoric worries me. The very right-wing instincts of the people who are in leadership positions in the Government concern me, in particular the idea of shrinking the State, convincing people to be individualistic and the talk of the tax burden. There is also the absolute cod of a rainy day fund, which I think was introduced into the Government's language by Fianna Fáil, which was trying to regain some credibility when it comes to economic language, seeing that it drove the country off a cliff, and so the Government has adopted it as a policy position. Let us not forget that I and my party were in government with the Minister of State and his party for five years, so we cannot be accused of not taking sensible or prudent economic decisions. However, this one is genuinely a cod. It is a political lie, in my view, because, at a time when we are still wounded as a nation from the last ten years, for the record 10,000 people on the homeless list, including 3,500 children, and for people in need of mental health services, disability services, drug treatment programmes and so on, it is raining. For people in the public services who are still hoping for pay restoration and those who are suffering from lack of motivation and morale in the teaching profession, given we now have an issue with teacher supply and cannot even get people to mark the exams, it is raining. I suggest to the Minister of State and the Government that this notion of a rainy day fund is a complete and utter cod. It is a political nonsense and is done purely to give a sense of prudence and sensible economic management, but it is not the action of a Government that cares for the entirety of the people. I want to speak about some of the obsessions the Minister of State and his Government seem to have in regard to tax cuts. In the last budget the Government decided to throw away €200 million worth of tax for no good reason, except to again convince the vast bulk of Irish people they are over-taxed when, in fact, they are not. That €200 million could have gone a long way to addressing some of the issues I have already spoken about. Again, the Minister of State speaks endlessly about the USC. I listened to Deputy Micheál Martin on radio last weekend speaking about all the services that need to be addressed, and then he also said we need to deal with USC. Why is it not the Government's obsession to end homelessness, illiteracy, poverty or inequality rather than ending the USC?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«USC brings in over €4 billion a year. I wish we had that kind of fiscal reality statement from the Government instead of constantly giving this impression of a tax burden - "we are over-taxed", "squeezed middle", "reduce tax", and so on. Why is the 12.5% corporation tax rate the unspeakable sacred cow of Irish politics? Why is it that the absolute sacred cow of Finnish politics, regardless of the political party or political standpoint, is equality in education? If one asks anybody from any political party in Finland what is the fundamental ethos underpinning education, they will say "equality". Even in Britain, which is tearing itself apart over Brexit, fundamentally they all believe in equality in health. They argue over it, they discuss it, but the NHS is something they cling to on either side of the aisle in Britain because they know the British people believe in equality in healthcare. What is the sacred cow here? The 12.5% corporation tax rate. What a soulless thing for us to feel so passionately about that we cannot even discuss it. My point is that while we are in a better space than we were, for the Minister of State to suggest to the House there is now space for us to reduce tax, to shrink the size of the State, to talk about public sector reforms and to say we have spent too much money, is really insulting. Effectively, he is saying €60 billion is too much. What was the phrase he used? He said:Each year central government spends more than €60 billion. I am convinced that scope remains to improve the efficiency with which this sum is allocated. I know what that means. The phraseology here is focused on public sector reform.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The record will reflect the fact I did not interrupt any other speaker.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will repeat the point. We have been wounded as a country over the ten years since the collapse of the economy.If we are expected to be bought off with talk of public sector reform, the overspend on public services the Minister of State is indicating and the nonsense about the rainy day fund at a time when the country is still wounded, I make the political charge that the Minister of State and the Government are determined to be the Government for 40% of the public. As long as that 40% can deliver the Government back after a general election, about which it keeps talking, it will be quite happy. Meanwhile, the rest of us can fight over the entrails that fall off the Government's table.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are 10,000 people homeless.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There are 3,500 children homeless.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State should suck up some of his own medicine.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that, like many of us, the Minister and Fianna Fáil are trying to grapple with this issue. We want to facilitate the ability of a child who has been reared through Irish to access education through his or her native tongue. That is reasonable. In fairness, Senator Gallagher has made a good fist of trying to devise a solution. Will the Minister confirm that he will continue to engage with those representative groups with concerns? They understand that he is doing his best. Will he communicate to me that there will be proper consultation with them in bringing to the fore what he is trying to achieve? Given that Irish is the first language of the State, a child who is reared through that language not being disadvantaged in the enrolment system when trying to access a Gaelscoil is a constitutional right.It would appear to me to be reasonable to have a certain number of places set aside for children from an Irish speaking background, but how to attest to that will be the difficulty. The Minister will have the support of Senators for his endeavours and we appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 43:In page 26, lines 30 to 37, to delete “virtue of—” on line 30 down to and including line 37 and substitute “virtue of a sibling of the student concerned attending the school.”.I have spoken on this issue twice already so the Minister knows my reservations on this part of the Bill. Essentially the section gives a school the opportunity to have 25% of the school places set aside for children. I was going to oppose this on the basis of children of past pupils, but I see that bizarrely the Minister has provided for the grandchildren of past pupils as well. I think that is adding insult to injury. I repeat this is a key lobbying point of an elite sector in Irish education who want this provision in order to keep the school ties alive. I do not think that has any place in this Bill. Every child should try to access their local school on the same basis and what is being wedged in is a new barrier that children from outside the area or whose parents have not attended primary or secondary school, and in particular secondary school, have to overcome. I do not think this is fair. It is elitist. It comes from a particular sector of Irish society and I really wish this provision was not included in the Bill.  I really wish we were not having this debate on this issue. I will be pressing this amendment, but not now.On the advice of the Acting Chairman, I will resubmit it on Report Stage if needs be. However, I have yet to hear the Minister's response to the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I really hope I get support across the House for my amendment when I resubmit it. I appreciate that previously a school could have had 100% of its students under this criteria. We are trying to change things and introduce legislation that will make things fairer. It is at the behest of a particular lobby group that this 25% cap is being applied. The Minister is right that Ruairí Quinn had a similar viewpoint to himself. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan had a different viewpoint. I hold fast to the view that children should try to access their local school on the same basis. The idea that a child's father or grandfather or mother or grandmother - let us be honest, though, that it is the boys' school tie network we are really talking about - has no place when we are trying to change things. There is genuinely a lot of good work in this Bill that we want to support. I do not really want to be nitpicking over this issue but it is wrong and elitist and should not be there. I think the Minister probably agrees with me in his own gut. We have a very vocal, powerful and well resourced lobby group that is well able to kick up a terrible amount of stink with local Deputies. It seems it is just not worth the political system's while taking them on. I would ask those in the Chamber who like to call themselves republicans whether they truly believe that a child whose father or grandfather went to particular school has more of a right to attend that school than somebody whose father or grandfather did not, even if the two children live right beside each other.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I ask the Leader to put on the record of the House the exact nature of the relationship between this Government and Deputy Michael Lowry, who has a criminal conviction for tax irregularities.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I found the Taoiseach's comments about this relationship at the weekend quite disturbing. I ask the Leader to inform the House exactly what support arrangements the Government has with Deputy Lowry, and indeed to publish those details. We would all be interested to know the exact nature of that relationship. I noticed that the confidence and supply agreement was flittered around the place on the Fianna Fáil benches a few moments ago. I would like to inform Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that I have done a short word count on the important issues covered in that document. It contains ten words on child poverty and 143 words on housing, but 603 words on water. It is obvious that when this agreement was being scratched together, water was 60 times more important than child poverty and four times more important than homelessness and housing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Surely that agreement, which considers water to be more important than anything else, especially housing and child poverty, contains all the answers to the water shortages and water problems we are having in this country at present.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister is busy.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sorry, I need to clarify. The Leader has not answered my question. I asked him about the relationship between Deputy Michael Lowry and this Government. He has not answered the question.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be as quick as possible. I have a level of sympathy for the Minister in trying to defend the process in which he clearly does not believe. He has been compared to Archbishop McQuaid but he reminds me of the band Maroon 5 in that insufferable World Cup advertisement, which sings "Don't worry about a thing. Every little thing is going to be all right". If the Minister was part of the Opposition he would rail against this process. If Sinn Féin had not been bought off, it would rail against this process as well.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is a circus and it is really embarrassing. I am glad the journalists have all gone home. A reputable European body has issued a report stinging in its critique of this legislation. It is only in front of us because the Fr. Ted alliance feels strongly about it. There are bits of this report in Sunday newspapers and in front of me. The Minister has said he has not seen it but again he says not to worry about a thing. With the greatest of respect, if the Minister is going to ask the Cabinet to publish the report on Thursday, could we not just halt everything until then?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We could then have a much more informed debate. The Minister will be able to go back to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who clearly feels very strongly about this and who I half-expected to be sitting in that chair instead of Deputy Flanagan when I came in this evening-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Let us do this properly. If the Minister was part of the Opposition, along with the Fine Gael representatives, it is just the kind of exercise that they would rail against. This is important legislation being railroaded through despite eminent European bodies raising serious questions about it. Fine Gael is meant to be the party of law and order so let us do this properly.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 19:In page 26, lines 30 to 37, to delete all words from and including "of—" in line 30 down to and including line 37 and substitute the following:"of a sibling of the student concerned attending or having attended the school.". This section of the Bill has been dubbed "the Clongowes section", which is probably accurate. It states: "...a parent or grandparent of the student concerned having previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to that criterion does not exceed 25 per cent of the available places as set out in the school’s annual admission notice for the school year concerned." This has no place in this Bill. I have spoken on this several times. The Minister knows my reasoning for this stance. This is an elitist provision, which has no place in this Bill. It has no place in a Bill proposed by anybody who genuinely believes in a republic. There is no reason to give more than 25% of the places in a school to children or grandchildren of past pupils. This would be odious enough if it referred only to children of past pupils, but the provision for grandchildren puts the cherry on the cake. Only one section of the education system is looking for this. The Minister and I know who they are. The private fee-paying school lobby are the only people who are looking for this. These are the ones who have advocated for this, and I will state the reason. People are afraid to say it because they are so powerful, they have so much influence and so many members of Cabinet are past pupils of theirs, so they have an open door. The reason is that they want to keep the royal bloodline going to their schools - the old ties network. They tend to be old boys. The Minister might as well have inserted "sons and grandsons". It would have exactly the same affect. I refer to the old boys' network, those who hang around, stay in touch with each other as business colleagues and on golf courses or kick around the corridors of power together. This lobby wants to ensure that its schools have this royal line of succession so that the children and grandchildren of past pupils will have a certain section roped off for themselves and will be allowed access to the school. We talk about equality. We have all mentioned equality this afternoon in reference to provision for Irish language speakers, Travellers, etc. How is somebody whose father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not attend secondary school supposed to have the same access to a school on that basis? Let us consider a Traveller child whose father or mother did not go to second level school. If a child is not from the local area, their father or mother will not have attended the local second level school.If a child is not from this country, clearly his or her father or mother did not go to the local second level school. If a child is from an area of acute disadvantage, it is more likely that his or her father or mother did not go to a second level school and it is extremely likely that the child's grandparents did not go to a second level school. Let us be honest. The only reason this provision exists is because of the powerful lobbying of a section of the education sector, which is fee-paying, exclusive and elitist. They want that exclusivity and elitism in legislation and they will get their way. I do not really expect much more from the Fine Gael Party but the Fianna Fáil Party is going to support it anyway. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together will support this section of the Bill, which gives more rights to children and grandchildren of past pupils. It is odious, elitist and wrong. I know the Minister will say that previously there was no cap and he has put one in place. That is not the point. There is much good stuff in this Bill and the Labour Party completely accepts that the Constitution puts constraints on what can be done with the baptism barrier. We are not going to play political football with that at all. We will not support amendments that ask the Minister to do more than he can because of constraints in the Constitution about religious ethos etc. We know the Bill goes further than many people would have imagined it could have gone in that regard. However, there is no need for this provision at all. My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, believed this should be at a zero level. Senators should not go far as I will be calling a vote on this. The compromise was meant to be 10% but that did not get through the Cabinet in the previous Government. The Bill did not get past Cabinet in the previous Government because of this section. People want this section to go through without any pointing to it or mention that this section of Irish society has so much influence in this Republic that the political system, over and over again, will bend over backwards for them. They want school ties written into legislation, which is disgusting. This elitism has ruined the country and gives every young person who does not come from that background the idea that life just is not fair and those people do not really play by the same rules. We are writing that into legislation as unless a pupil's father or grandfather went to the school, for example, there is not the same right of access. I will make a suggestion to the Minister but he will not do it. He should scrap this by agreeing to our amendment and saying it is right. He will not do it. Fianna Fáil is the so-called republican party but if it supports the Government on this, it should not speak about equality in education in this Chamber or the other Chamber ever again. This provision puts Travellers, migrants and poor children at a disadvantage and it is being put in legislation. This is supposed to be a republic. I know what the Minister will say as he has already said it twice. We just have to go with it. Before coming to this House I heard rumours of the influence of elitist groups in Irish society on members of the Cabinet and politicians in this place but I did not really believe it. It is now written in front of me and we will pass it into law. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will be brief. At the end of the political term, it is important to reflect on where we are and where we are going. As others have done, I wish everyone across the Chamber a rest over the summer months, most importantly the staff who have facilitated us every day we are here. Democracy is very important. Any of us watching television last night, whether it was the Brexit debate in Britain or what happened in Helsinki between Trump and Putin, will have realised that democracy is very fragile. In these Houses at least, we should always say to ourselves that, whatever arguments we may have, left and right, we have an opportunity here to do a great deal of good when we work together. We should never underestimate the importance of that. Democracy is not something we can take for granted and we should never be complacent about it. We should never assume we will always have it in Ireland and we must work every day to ensure people believe in it and in our democratic institutions. People should believe their Parliament, local authorities and politicians work for them. When we see what is happening across Europe, the United States and Britain, we should be proud of what we are achieving in this Oireachtas. Our country is wounded and we are coming out of a very difficult time. While we have made improvements and can, hopefully, look to the future, my brief experience here since 2011 suggests that politics works best when we work together. There have been great examples of that from every party and Independent in the Houses. I hope everyone enjoys their rest and I look forward to working with and, indeed, against certain people when we come back in September.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Senator Mullen loves the 1980s.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and her officials for engaging with me and the Labour Party in facilitating the passing of this legislation. I thank all Members for supporting it. I do not want to make value judgments or blame anyone but there may be a five year old in a school whose parents are not empowered to, or are going through circumstances where they cannot, attend to the child's educational needs. They may love their children deeply but circumstances can sometimes get in the way. With the passing of this Bill, however, the State and Tusla can encourage those parents and engage with the family to ensure the educational rights of a child under six are upheld. It is fundamentally important that every child gets the best start, and poor attendance patterns which start when a child is aged five can last a lifetime. We are not trying to impinge on families or hurt them but we have to uphold the education rights of children. Their attendance at school is important and we cannot wait until they are six to address these issues. I thank the Minister on a personal and political level. She understands, instinctively, the power of education and she has a vision of the five year old in her mind, as well as knowledge of what an education can do for them. That is what this Bill is trying to achieve. The State can now intervene in a compassionate and empowering fashion with the child and the parents to ensure the child can have his or her education rights upheld. I appreciate what the Minister and her officials have done and I accept that her amendments had to be made to achieve what we want. I look forward to it being passed into law by both Houses so that five year olds and younger children in our education system can be protected.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for being here. I very much appreciate it and know that she will feel strongly about the issue I am about to raise. I also appreciate that her Department is working as best it can to find a resolution to the issues I raise. I welcome in the Gallery Ms Fiona Bailey, the mother of Sam Bailey. I met the family of Grace O'Malley from Mayo last week. Last week there was a demonstration outside Leinster House, of which I think the Minister of State was aware, about the 25 children in this country who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy type 2. It called on the Government to speed up the process of making the wonder drug, as it is called, Spinraza available to these children. It is a vitally important intervention that these children greatly need. What the families are asking for is the exact timeline for negotiation between the HSE and Biogen, the manufacturer of this drug. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who I know is engaged in this issue and seeks a resolution of it, tweeted last week to one of the parents involved in this campaign that the issue is currently with the HSE, that there needs to be engagement between the HSE and the company, that he will make sure it happens and that he knows how important it is to families. What the families are really asking for is clarification as to where the process is. It is understood that Biogen made an offer on 29 July and that a high-level meeting on the issue may be held in the Department tomorrow. Spinal muscular atrophy type 2 is a particularly difficult condition with which to live. The families are doing their absolute best and they appreciate that there are people working in the Department who are doing their best to ensure we can come to a resolution of this issue. I know from my time as a Minister of State in that Department and from working in these Houses that no one in politics tries to be a blocker or to increase the suffering of children. The 25 children are doing well but, having spoken to their families last week and again this morning, I understand they fear facing into winter, even at this time of year. The impact winter could have on children with this condition is frightening.This drug could make all the difference. It is freely available in 20 countries in Europe, but for some reason, two do not have it, one of which, unfortunately, is Ireland. We know the process and campaign the Government went through to find a solution for children with cystic fibrosis in the case of Orkambi. It was much appreciated. I think it is within the Minister of State's capacity to give the families affected by this condition some hope. They want clarification of where the Government is in negotiations with the company. Can we hope and expect Spinraza to be freely available for the children in question in that they can look forward to having more complete lives and fulfilling their potential?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the answer and the fact that the Minister of State has outlined the process involved, but what the families really need to know is when it will happen. I know that the Minister of State may not be in a position to give me that answer now, but I ask her to impress on the Minister the importance of this matter. I understand the HSE has yet to make the final decision, but I think the Minister of State appreciate that the families listening to this debate, including a mother who is in the Visitors Gallery, want to know when it will be made. Will the Minister of State impress on the Minister the importance of the matter? Is he in a position to meet representatives of the families? Will he give an assurance, as he did, in fairness, through social media last week, that he cares passionately about it? Will the Minister of State ask him for clarity on the timeline involved? That is what the families really want. While they appreciate that negotiations are ongoing, that there is a cost issue and that these matters are technical and complicated, the issue is of critical importance to the children. Will the Minister of State impress on the Minister the importance of meeting the families to outline the timeline involved? We cannot live off an answer that a final decision has yet to be made, with no sense as to when it will be made. As a compassionate politician, the Minister of State will appreciate this. I ask for clarity on the issue. I know that the Minister will listen to the Minister of State and wants to engage with the families to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. I refer to the inaction of the Department of Education and Skills vis-à-vis unregulated seclusion and restraint of children with disabilities. With the greatest respect to her, I am disappointed that none of the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs considers this issue important enough to merit their attendance in person to discuss it. Inclusion Ireland published a discussion document last week, "Shining a light on seclusion and restraint in schools in Ireland", which shares stories of 14 children with a disability, some as young as five years of age. Following the publication of the document, Departments should have been reeling in an effort to react to the issues that it raises. Inclusion Ireland is concerned that despite being asked by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on three occasions, the Department of Education and Skills has failed to provide best practice guidelines or to introduce reporting and monitoring protocols. Mr. Paddy Connolly, chief executive officer, CEO, of Inclusion Ireland, has stated that the rights and welfare of children should be at the centre of all that happens in schools. On the issue of managing the use of seclusion and restraint, best practice includes support and training for staff, whole-of-school positive behaviour strategies, school leadership and external inputs such as child mental health or disability services.  I put the Minister of State on notice that my colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane, will introduce legislation on this matter, to which the Government will have to respond. I will now read into the record some of the cases that were outlined in the discussion document. The names have been changed to protect the identity of the children involved.  One day I went to collect Brian* from his special school and he was sitting on the sofa in reception crying. His arms were very sore and staff would not tell me what happened. Later Brian calmed down and could tell me two Special Needs Assistants had held him face down on the floor by his arms which were now black and blue. Michael*, who was 10 years old at the time, wasn’t allowed in the classroom of his Dublin school for 3 months. Instead Michael had to work in an empty room next door to the room where his class-mates were working. My daughter Jenny* was restrained in a ‘prone restraint’ which is being held in a face down position by 2 or three people. On one month this took place up to 50 times and this went on for some time. William* was restrained in his school transport by the escort with his head held down physically for the whole journey which took 20 minutes. William said he found it very hard to breathe and it was a painful experience. On other occasions William’s hands were held down ‘just in case’. Seán* was restrained by a teacher when he was in senior infants. The teacher in question told me that I didn’t have to worry about Seán’s behaviour in school as he had found a way to restrain him. Luke* attended a special school and he told me that his teacher had locked him into a toilet. The school denied this when I complained. We moved him to another school and a number of months later I was contacted by Tusla as two more children had alleged the teacher had locked them into a toilet. An investigation followed but found that the teacher posed no risk to children and the teacher returned to the school. “Killian* was locked into a small storage room with a small window. We were initially told the room would only ever be used as a ‘last resort’. The teacher put Killian into this locked room, unattended for up to four or five hours for trivial reasons such as not doing school work quick enough or talking in class.These are testimonies from the parents of children with disabilities who are some of the most vulnerable children in the education system. The Department of Education and Skills, the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be all over this report, as well as making statements on how they are going to react to it. The reaction from Inclusion Ireland is one of exasperation at the lack of action from the Department. I understand the stresses that teachers in this area experience but the 14 case studies in this report are appalling and I want to know what the Government is going to do about it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for her reply, but this sort of reply drives me round the twist. The first paragraph of the reply is a classic case of the Department saying it is somebody else's problem: "The board of management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the pupils in their schools ... Schools are not required to report such interventions to the Department." It is not, therefore, up to the Department. Mr. Paddy Connolly, CEO of Inclusion Ireland, stated that the NCSE has asked the Department on three occasions to provide best practice guidelines. That has not happened but, according to this reply, it will respond to the NCSE by June 2019. I accept that this is not the Minister of State's area of responsibility, but I want her to impress on the Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who are responsible that there is no sense of urgency in this reply. I get the impression from this that everything is fine and tickety-boo, there are ways for people to complain, the Department received only one complaint and so on. There is nothing in the reply that makes me feel that the people who wrote it have read what I have read into the record today in respect of children being locked in toilets, having their faces held down on bus transport or in classrooms, or being isolated in small rooms. Nobody is suggesting that this is an easy job but a report such as this should have made Departments react in a different way from this classic response of, "It is not really our responsibility, it is somebody else's responsibility. We are looking at it and will come back to you in due course". If anybody in this House was told that a child of theirs had been locked in the toilet or gone through any of the events raised in this report, I am sure there would be hell to pay, but I do not get a sense from this reply that the Department has that feeling. I reiterate that if this was taken seriously, there would be a Minister with responsibility for the area. Will the Minister of State impress on those responsible the need to do something a little more urgent and impressive to give us the sense that they are taking this matter seriously? If I was the mother or father of one of these children with disabilities who have gone through these events and this response was produced, I would not be impressed.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State and his officials for being here and working with this House to try to get this legislation to the next Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I also congratulate my colleague, Senator Bacik, on her hard work in that regard. We all know in this House that Private Members' time is fairly precious. When one has it, one wants to make sure one has a topic or legislation which is very important. That is why we have chosen this one. We believe we have an opportunity to gain cross-party support for this measure to take it to the next Stage. The year we are in has been referenced in regard to gender equality, with the 100th anniversary of some women being given the franchise and this year's referendum. There are very deep gender equality issues in our society which are still unresolved. We separate children at primary school level on the basis of gender. We are almost unique in that regard. We separate children at secondary school level by gender. That is disproportionately prevalent in Ireland, more so than in any European country. One third of secondary schools are gender-specific, which is very unusual. Women are under-represented in politics and the media and on executive boards. There are other countries that take steps in that regard. It is not just Ireland, which insists on gender equality on State boards. Germany has passed legislation to ensure gender equality on commercial corporate boards. The measures we are taking are achievable and attainable and ones everybody in the House should support. I absolutely concur with my colleagues that there is a window of opportunity. In a place where we can be very divisive and spot opportunities to have a go at each other, there is an opportunity to move this legislation to the next Stage and have it passed in the Seanad and possibly by the Oireachtas by Christmas. That would put this House and the Oireachtas in general in a good light considering what is happening in the current year. I ask Members across the floor to take the goodwill that is evident from all parties and the Government and move collectively to take this Bill to the next Stage and have it passed. We should apply the same spirit to the amendment. A huge amount of work has been put into this legislation. There has been research and the researchers have been referenced. I refer to the phrase Hillary Clinton has often used: "You cannot be what you cannot see." If women or members of a minority faith, ethnicity or sexual orientation do not see themselves in positions of power and influence, they cannot aspire to being in them. That is purely what we are trying to achieve on pay, which is basic and fundamental to how people operate in an economy. On that basis, I ask the Minister of State to facilitate what we are trying to achieve and ask all parties to do the same.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is important that everybody in this Chamber realise that without taxpayers next week's budget would be impossible. Compliant taxpayers are the unsung heroes of this country. They pay for nurses, gardaí, teachers and social welfare system, including pensions for older people. I would like to object to some of the rhetoric from Government sources in the past while regarding non-compliant taxpayers or those who avail of the tax exile system. A Fine Gael MEP has congratulated one tax exile on his supposed philanthropic donations to GAA clubs. This individual has decided that his money is not good enough to pay for teachers, nurses, gardaí and pension provisions in Ireland and has decided to reside overseas. We have a Minister of State who visited a convicted tax evader in prison and who made inappropriate advances to the Minister for Justice and Equality to intervene in the case. Now we have a Government that is reliant on the support of somebody with a criminal conviction for tax irregularities. I ask Fine Gael and the Government to realise that without people who do not avail of tax exile status and are proud to pay their taxes we would have no budget and we would have no capacity to pay for the public services that everybody in this country needs.  I again raise the issue of homelessness. In particular, I refer to the disgusting suggestion that homeless people should be housed on a cruise ship docked on the quays of Dublin city. I am glad to hear since the idea was - pardon the pun - floated that the Minister has come out and rejected the idea. The Government should do what the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government did in 2011. When we realised that there was economic crisis, an Economic Management Council was established. The then Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform met weekly to manage the economic crisis and found a way out of it. We are currently in a housing crisis. It has reached such a scale that it is time for the Government to take it as seriously as the economic crisis of a number of years ago and to form a housing management council comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government. If this idea of housing homeless families on a boat is the best that Government representatives can come up with or defend on national media, they need to think differently about their strategies. Everybody in these Houses wants the housing, rental and homelessness crises resolved. The establishment of a housing management council would be a practical measure. It would give some comfort to Oireachtas Members and the country that the Government was genuinely taking the matter seriously and not sending out spokespeople to defend a disgusting suggestion that people be housed on boats instead of in houses.

We will stand with all survivors in order to try to obtain justice and ensure this will never happen again. I call for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the relationship between church and State. The influence of the Catholic Church on the Government is disturbing. The Minister issued a circular on 19 February stating there was no longer a necessity for children in second level State schools to attend religious instruction and that they would be offered alternative subjects. The position in that regard was reversed last week. Freedom of information documents obtained by RTÉ show the level of lobbying done by Catholic Church organisations which seem to have a remarkable influence on the mindset of the Minister for Education and Skills who has changed his mind and, at the stroke of a pen, decided to place children in second level State schools who do not wish to attend religious instruction classes at a disadvantage. The lobbying that goes on with the Government is remarkable. The private school sector brought an influence to bear on the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill and got exactly what it wanted. The alcohol lobby brought its influence to bear on the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. The landlord and developer class had an influence on the budget announced today. The renters and homeless were at the bottom of the list when it came to the allocation of moneys in the budget. This at a time when Ireland is gripped by its greatest crisis - social or otherwise. I ask the Leader to facilitate a long-needed debate on the relationship between church and State in the area of education. The Labour Party believes it is beyond time that this matter be discussed by a constitutional convention or a citizens' assembly in order to put a range of questions to the people and break the link between church and State in the area of education. This should also be done in the area health, but I will concentrate on education today. This change of policy at the behest of well-resourced lobby groups from the Catholic Church raises many questions as to who holds the power when it comes to education. I formally ask that time be made available for a debate on this matter. I formally second Senator Boyhan's proposal.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. Much of what I was going to contribute to the conversation has been raised by my colleagues, Senators Mac Lochlainn and Ruane. I will make my contribution relatively short. As Senator Ruane has said, there is no huge rush to get this done if we are not going to get it done correctly and properly. The Unite trade union, with which I hope the Minister of State will engage, has a very impressive document that details not just its concerns on the Bill but also the opportunities. As Senator Mac Lochlainn said, the Bill is a vehicle that affords us an opportunity to do more in a sector, especially around the English language teaching sector, which as we all know has been hugely problematic and rife with a number of problems. Unite has stated it has been dealing with cases that illustrate a range of abuses relating to contracts and wages and issues of discrimination where a non-native English speaker is treated differently from a native English speaker when it comes to wage rates. The sector is known for having precarious employment practices and variable pay rates. We have spoken about the issue of zero-hour contracts. Unite has made two particular proposals which I believe are viable and decent and the Labour Party supports these proposals. The Labour Party will bring forward amendments, as I know other parties will also do. It is interesting that my colleagues who represent the left in this Chamber, such as Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and like-minded Independents, are focusing on the vulnerable workers in the sector, whereas other speakers have been very short in their contributions and have perhaps focused on those who do not necessarily need the same protections. We suggest section 25 be amended to establish a fair employment mark as part of the IEM. This is the way that employment practices have to work. We have to ensure that workplaces and employers are treating their employees fairly and that this should be known to anyone who comes into contact with whatever institution they engage. We also advocate for teacher protection funds. Again, given the precarious nature of these schools, the way they open and close and the way they can collapse overnight and not be seen again, the people working in this sector deserve much more protection. These proposals are positive and proactive. They work within the vehicles provided for us by the Minister of State. We are in the position where we want to welcome this Bill but we want to improve it for those who are most vulnerable within the sector. I hope the Minister agrees that the proposals make sense. As Senator Ruane said, let us get this right and, if we can, use the process to its utmost at the various stages. Let us ensure the protections needed for workers within the sector are put in place.If I was to advise anybody to use the services of an English language school, it would be of great comfort to me to know that an individual school had a fair employment mark. It would let me know in my heart of hearts that everyone was being treated fairly. The teacher protection fund, which has been outlined, makes sense. I advise the Minister of State not to be adversarial. Let us work together to ensure that, whatever her officials say about our contributions or if they wish to critique what we have said, we can somehow meet between the two positions. The proposals as outlined make sense. We all want to have a sector of which we can be proud and over which we can stand.  With those remarks, I join Senators Ruane and Mac Lochlainn in hoping we can work constructively on this issue which we will discuss again on the next Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a matter of grave concern that the Government is now dependent, in a formal way, on the support of Deputy Lowry. Having said that, I also find it disturbing that the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Breen, has not explained himself to either House of the Oireachtas in respect of his engagement with Mr. McCourt and the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, which was the cause of the latter's resignation.I consider it outrageous that the Minister of State would arrange for a senior Minister to travel over 170 miles to attend a dinner with a constituent of his yet we are supposed to believe they never discussed the contract or the tendering and to accept that that is okay because the Minister of State has no involvement in that Department. If the former Minister resigned on the basis of inappropriate contact with Mr. McCourt, surely, the Minister of State must at least account to this or the Lower House for his behaviour if we are to have continued confidence in his capacity to fulfil his duties. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, come to the House and account for his actions. If he has nothing to hide, there is no reason for the Leader of the House not to facilitate that request.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is fine, but I remember that-----

I can only imagine the reaction in this House, the Lower House and the media if any Labour Party Minister or the Minister of State in the previous Government did what the Minister of State has done. I am quite sure Fine Gael is hoping this will be forgotten about such that it can move on to other issues and pretend it did not happen but two things must go out to the-----

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He has a criminal conviction for tax irregularities. The Government is now trying to move away from a controversy relating to the actions of a Minister of State facilitating a dinner between a bidder and a senior Minister, for which the senior Minister resigned. If the Government is trying to move away from that situation, it says a lot about where the Fine Gael Party is now.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am making that request of the Leader-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am formally requesting that the Leader bring the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, to the House.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None« If the Leader does not facilitate the request, it will say an awful lot about his party, and what he really believes regarding ethics and morality and how politics should be properly conducted in this country.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Let it go.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State. He is aware of and familiar with the issue of the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital. I have visited it on several occasions and I am sure he has also done so. The staff of the department are dedicated and hardworking, but there is a need to upgrade the physical environment in which they operate. There are other issues relating to the department of which all present are aware, such as the ageing demographic in the area, staff requirements, etc., which must be addressed by the Department of Health. However, it has long been acknowledged that the need for a new emergency department is a top priority for the staff. In the dying days of the previous Government, a plan was formulated with senior hospital officials for a €45 million refurbishment of the emergency department. The Minister of State has made me aware that good news is forthcoming relating to the plans for the department and I know that €100,000 has been allocated in respect of the design phase. However, I have searched for a reference to the €40 million which the Minister of State indicated has been allocated to the refurbishment or reconstruction of the accident and emergency department and cannot find it. Deputy Brendan Ryan tabled parliamentary questions on the matter on my behalf. The responses state that it is a matter for the HSE. I have searched the capital plan for mention of the project but cannot locate any references to it. Where is the €40 million allocation the Minister of State announced on several occasions? If it exists and is contained in the capital plan, I ask for an indication as to the timeline for the refurbishment of this facility, which, as the Minister of State and I know, is badly needed by communities on the northside.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for the reply. There is a bit in his reply which is not in my copy, which I find a bit strange. The Minister of State made reference - which is not in the reply I have here - to restrictions on the site or issues relating to the site. Perhaps the Minister of State might expand on that please. On the timeline, I am not sure if they are written in notes that he has done himself from his own knowledge of dealing with officials or if there is a reason the two scripts are different, but I would be interested in getting that information in written form if that is in order.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is that for the emergency department?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Within the complex?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I raise the issue of the potential establishment of a transport police.  The Leader will be aware of a number of unsavoury incidents on the north side DART line.  A recent stabbing incident happened between Killester and Harmonstown stations.  Earlier this year a DART service was stalled while a gang of youths tried to spray-paint the outside of the carriage between Bayside and Howth Junction stations.  There are ongoing vandalism and other issues at Clongriffin station.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has said he is open to the idea of having a transport police.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the potential of establishing such a force from within An Garda Síochána to ensure that those who work on, and use, our train services feel safe and secure as they go about their daily business.  Those who believe in public transport, as I do, need to feel safe and secure while accessing that service.  This House should react positively to the initiatives taken by Councillor Rebecca Moynihan on Dublin City Council and Councillor Deirdre Kingston on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  They have secured funding to roll out pilot schemes to provide free sanitary products in their council areas.  An initiative by Councillor Moynihan on Dublin City Council was successful a number of months ago.  At last night's Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council budget meeting, Councillor Kingston secured funding for a pilot scheme to provide free sanitary products in libraries.  A Plan International Ireland survey has found that more than 50% of girls aged from 12 to 19 are unable to afford sanitary products.  We could tackle period poverty if we were to provide free products in our primary and secondary schools.  It is not a radical proposal; it has been done in Scotland.  We believe it would cost about €5 million.  It would be useful to have a debate on period poverty in the House and I call on the Leader to facilitate that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I join with others in congratulating the Social Democrats on bringing forward this Bill. As Senator Ruane has said, the provision in the Bill is for unpaid leave because introducing paid parental leave would create a cost on the Exchequer. I also congratulate the Fianna Fáil group on taking on the mantle and bringing it to the House during its Private Members' time. It is a little disquieting that some of the Government representatives in this House speak to the concerns of the employers first and foremost
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The reality from my perspective if I am to get a grip is that the balance of conversation in this House never seems to go to the worker. It is the stress and strain on workers and the young parent who is at work which is the motivation behind this Bill. I understand that the employer has to make money but a worker is trying to raise a family. Acting Chairman, there is a conversation happening to my left.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The point I am trying to make is that the balance of conversation on this issue is always lopsided in favour of the employer. Scandinavian democracies such as Sweden, Iceland and Finland place a great emphasis on gender equality. I believe Iceland makes an entire year of parental leave available to parents. The aim of this is to ensure becoming a parent does not automatically lead to many stressful conversations among couples about who will take time off, or whether they can afford to have the child. If we fully believe that bringing a child into the world is one of the most wonderful experiences a family can have, such conversations would not happen. This type of legislation should be welcomed by employers on the basis that an employee who is happy at home and feels that he or she is making a contribution to family life will be happy in the workplace as well. This approach works. Many employers' organisations have finally embraced the idea of gender equality in workplaces. Workers work best in that environment. Employers are ensuring they have LGBT-friendly workplaces because they know LGBT workers work better in that kind of environment. It is clear to those with a cold and calculated capitalist mindset that workers are more productive if they are happier. Employers should embrace the idea that when their younger employees become parents, the worry and stress associated with trying to balance work and life will probably make them less productive in the workplace. When one becomes a parent, it should not be a time of stress about money or one's work-life balance. One should be supported by the State in any way it can. In Iceland, paid parental leave can be shared between both parents, both partners or whoever is at home over the course of a year. We should have this type of vision for the first year of a child's life. Both parents - or whichever one of them is in a position to raise the child - should not be burdened by this kind of worry or stress. It is inevitable that the mentality of the child is affected by what is going on. All the research that has been conducted around the world proves that being in a stressed environment affects a child's mindset from a young age. We should be mindful of the ability of children to feel the anxiety of others. I welcome this legislation. It is great to have this conversation. It is to be welcomed that the debate in this House has been facilitated by the Social Democrats and Fianna Fáil. When I held the position currently held by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, I worked hard to secure two weeks of paid paternity leave. It was a good move. A wider vision is needed. I reiterate that there needs to be a focus on what is good for workers and families. Employers should embrace that conversation and be part of it. They need to realise that happy people are happier and more productive workers.

I also second the proposal of Senator Ruane that we have a debate in this House on the national drugs strategy but the main point I want to make today if the Leader could-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is important.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I just want to formally support what Senator Ruane said. I raise the matter of a secondary school in Kildare. It would be greatly appreciated if the Leader could pass on my comments to the Minister for Education and Skills because my capacity to raise this with him formally between now and next Tuesday is limited. A High Court case has been taken by a contractor regarding the tender process which means that whatever buildings that St. Paul's in Monasterevin is hoping to get built could be delayed and Councillor Mark Wall in Kildare is concerned about this.I know the Minister is extremely busy with the school building issue at the moment but it appears this school has been waiting for 15 years for rebuilding works. This issue is now in the High Court and, potentially, it is going to delay this much needed and anticipated building work. I ask the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, the importance of this issue and to communicate with me in whatever way possible on St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue is about the workers, as opposed to it being a political football.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Taoiseach did that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We never blamed the workers.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It suits the narrative of a right-wing lunatic who uses this culture to blame workers on the front line in the health service.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I know it is serious. If Sinn Féin did something about it, it would be helpful.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join Senator Clifford-Lee and Deputy Coppinger in expressing disgust at the argument made in the criminal courts in recent days. The Law Reform Commission has concluded a consultation process on the issue of consent related to the update of Ireland's consent laws. It would be appropriate in that context for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to address this House on the issue of rape crime, sexual assault, consent law and how we in this House can be of benefit in assisting the changing of the law in this regard, if required. The message should go out from this House and from every politician and person of influence in this country that the one cause of rape is a rapist. On Brexit, nobody has seen the draft as of yet. This is a critical time for our country, North and South. I support the calls for a debate on the deal in this House when the text becomes available to us. I am happy to support the Government's endeavours in regard to this deal but the Labour Party holds out hope for a second referendum. It is the responsibility of the Labour Party in Britain to lead that charge. The Labour Party here, through the social democratic family across Europe, will seek to exert influence on Jeremy Corbyn to change his view and to campaign for a second referendum on the basis that there is information to hand now that was not available to the people in 2016. Emotions are no longer running high and the complexities of exiting Europe are much clearer now than they were two and a half years ago. The final deal that is being proposed should be put to the British people, including the people of Northern Ireland. I am sure that if this were to happen, we would have a different scenario. I still hold out hope that Brexit can be stopped.It is the political responsibility of the leader of the Opposition in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn, to lead that fight.  My final point concerns BusConnects and bus corridors. I know that quite a number of people in Dublin city have received communications from the NTA about their front gardens potentially being taken away because of the new infrastructure that is being put in place. I know that there is the potential for a cycle line in Marino to be re-directed from Fairview through certain roads in Marino and on to the Malahide Road. Could the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come to the House to talk about BusConnects? It has the potential to be positive but it could also have a number of negative effects on a number of small communities. If we could have that debate here and have a bit of political leadership on the issue rather than the Minister distancing himself from the NTA, it would also be of benefit.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I go door to door as often as I can and the other night in Raheny I came across two families with children in dire need of help from the Government. One family has a child in need of a psychological assessment in a school where there are 12 such children in need of a psychological assessment. Three of them will be able to get that assessment but this child is not one of them. The parent is now faced with the prospect of either going privately, at a cost of €650, or not having an assessment at all. What are the Government's plans to ensure every child who needs an assessment can obtain one in order that he or she can maximise his or her potential? I came across another family where the situation was even more worrying and distressing, and the family has no problem with me naming them. Abigail, the daughter of Claire and Mark, was diagnosed with autism at the age of two. They also have two younger children and difficult enough as it is to hear that type of news about the daughter they love dearly, they have fought a war since that diagnosis to get any sort of early intervention from the HSE to benefit their child. In recent days, they were told the earliest they will get help from the early intervention team in north Dublin is approximately six months' time. The child will be almost five years of age. She will finally get help almost three years after her diagnosis. She is approximately 150th on the list, but there are hundreds and hundreds of children on the list. Unfortunately, in this country, not only must people deal with the difficulty of managing a child with autism, as well as every other aspect of family life such as looking after other children and doing their best for them, they must also embark on a war with the State. Unless people kick, shout, roar and scream, it appears they get nowhere, and it is utterly exhausting. I do not know of any other European country that has a waiting list of this nature for a child as vulnerable who needs this intervention. There may have been an argument a number of years ago, in the pit of an economic recession, that there was no money. We could have argued over and back about the priorities in budgets and so on. In the current circumstances, however, when it is clear there are resources, why must Abigail wait three years to get access to an early intervention team in order that she can begin the journey of maximising her potential as a little girl?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I acknowledge that the Minister of State is a compassionate individual who feels strongly about this issue. What time does he think is reasonable to wait from the diagnosis of a child just like Abigail to the beginning of intervention? What time does he aim for? What is his vision? Does he feel that three years is too long? I am sure that he does. What is a reasonable length of time for a family in this scenario to wait? I mean the families that have children like Abigail. I do not think it is good enough for a family to be stressed over waiting for an intervention. They will have to deal with this diagnosis for many years to come as will other members of the family. Everybody around the family will be clued in to this issue. There is a constant state of conflict with agencies that are supposed to surround people with care and compassion. As happens in other jurisdictions when there is a diagnosis like this, one automatically feels as if there is a team of people working with the family and the child to improve his or her circumstances. The situation is completely different in Ireland where one feels almost completely abandoned and must work through this by oneself. The stress, as one can appreciate, is quite substantial. I ask the Minister of State the following again. What timescale does he think is appropriate from the time that a child gets a diagnosis to the time that the early intervention team can click into place? Are we working towards that timeframe? Then we can have a sense that we are all working together.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I cannot accept that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister of State must have a view.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Deputy is a Minister of State in the Department of Health so he must have a view on what is an appropriate waiting time.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That answer is absolutely unacceptable. I genuinely do not want to do this but it is unbelievable.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join with others in seeking a debate on sports capital funding. What was outlined in recent days in respect of Ministers lobbying heavily for private golf clubs is quite disturbing. That fund is deliberately to benefit children in disadvantaged areas, in particular to enable them to access sports facilities and compete on a level playing field. A debate is necessary and I call on the Leader to facilitate it with the Minister who has responsibility for sport. In this regard, I pay tribute to Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane who left their positions as manager and assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland soccer team by mutual consent this morning. Many of us have had a difficult time following the Irish team in the past year but we need to look back to the great wins over Germany and Austria to get us to the European Championships. The best half of football I have probably ever seen an Irish team play was during the match against Sweden in the European Championships. I also saw the team getting a one-nil win over a great Austrian side in Vienna. They lifted the expectations of the Irish soccer side for a number of years. Things have not been great in their most recent period. Whoever takes on the job, be it Stephen Kenny, Brian Kerr or whoever, it is important to give credit where it is due even though the past year or so has been difficult. I also want to raise the issue of the Government's response to our Private Member's Bill that will be debated this evening. Our citizenship Bill would give effect to citizenship rights for children born in Ireland who have been resident here for three years. The Government has decided to oppose the Bill and I find this quite outrageous.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister for Health can go around his constituency of Wicklow to advocate for a child who may be deported and the Minister for Justice and Equality can go around his constituency of Laois to advocate for a child who may be deported but when it comes to an overall system to improve the situation for all children who may not be their constituents they are against it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I find it absolutely unbelievable. I appreciate we will have plenty of time to flesh this out this evening but I find it very disturbing that it is fair enough to get stuck into a campaign as a constituency issue for a child who is clearly identified but when the Government has a chance to regularise the situation for children who do not need to be deported and who may be deported it turns its back on them in the most callous fashion. It backed the referendum in 2004, which was wrong. The Labour Party along with Sinn Féin, the Green Party and others campaigned against the referendum.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«And Independent Members. Now the Government has an opportunity to put it right and it is turning its back on the children it pretends to support in individual cases in Wicklow and Laois.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is not an answer.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is remarkable and very disappointing.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Only for private golfers.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Civil War ended in 1923.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland for being here this evening. Their advocacy and lobbying shows the best of our country and what it means to be Irish. I am bitterly disappointed at the Government’s reaction to this Bill, which I genuinely did not expect, but I will start on a point of unity. No mainstream political party has ever done this. Immigration never comes up in general elections.The race card has only been played once during my political career. That was in 2004 during an unnecessary referendum. It was a despicable gesture by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government of the day. I remember it, as do other candidates who ran in the local elections held on the same day. I remember reports of African-Irish families being booed at polling stations. I swore when I got elected to the city council on that day that I would never forget the emotions I felt during that referendum campaign, which my party and others on the left stood against. The Bill does not overturn the result of that referendum. It does not give automatic citizenship rights to Irish-born children. What it does is allow that a child born on this island, that is, in Ireland, North or South, has the right to citizenship after residency of three years. As has been said, if the Government is opposing this, what the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, did in Wicklow was a lie and what the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who was in this Chamber only moments ago, did in Laois was a lie. They are well able to accept the applause of their constituents when it comes to a popular campaign around an individual who was facing deportation. However, when it comes to regularising the situation and having legislation to underpin the rights of all children in that situation, regardless of whether they can run a media campaign and regardless of how influential they are, they are turning it down. Despite all these launches relating to children's rights for the next five years and all this talk about a new republic, about getting up early in the morning and about a republic of opportunity, what opportunity are we handing to a child who is eight years old, Irish-born, knows no other country but Ireland and who faces deportation? The only chance they have is if they have a campaign group that is willing to go to a local Minister, who might step in and save the day on an individual basis. What disappoints me most is that this is happening despite the Seanad having been really progressive, across all parties, Government parties included, on issues such as direct provision and advocating for the rights of undocumented workers. All of us have collectively called out the hypocrisy of going to the White House and advocating for undocumented workers in the United States and advocating for the rights of dreamer children. Dreamer children are dealt with in the Bill before the House. How dare we suggest that Trump is not doing the right thing when it comes to dreamer children and taking them away from their families, when this is exactly what we are dealing with here? We are dealing with dreamer children. We are dealing with children whose position here needs to be regularised. What the Government is stating is that they are not important enough, that they do not have access or influence and that it will do this on an individual basis but not collectively. I did not want to make this contribution. I wanted to make a contribution that would unify the House. I wanted to say that we, as Irish politicians, are better at this and that the 2004 referendum was a blip, a once-off mistake that involved the playing of the race card and something that should not happen again. The Government has an opportunity now, if it changes its mind, to regularise the situation of Irish children and to ensure that their schoolmates are not looking around themselves at an empty chair in the classroom and wondering why this so-called republic is sending them to countries of which they have no knowledge. I urge all Members to back this Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Kick him under the table there, Martin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I raise again the issue raised previously by Senator Freeman, namely, that of children with special needs. I also attended the meeting last night in Donnycarney and I listened to parents in deep distress talk about the lack of services available to them. I have also been dealing this week with a family in Raheny whose daughter, Abigail, was diagnosed with autism at two years of age. The family has been told that she is unlikely to get access to an early intervention team until she reaches five years of age. Without wanting to get political about this, the Taoiseach stated that he can throw away €3 billion in taxes over the next five years. This is at a time when families are exhausted, suffering and wounded by their experience of having to go to war with the State, which is what happens when one has a child with special educational needs. The State does not provide these people with support to maximise their children's potential. In effect, they must go to war with the State. The Department of Health, as Senator Freeman suggested, and the Department of Education and Skills are completely unequipped to deal with this matter. It may be time for the sections of those Departments which deal with children with special educational needs to be transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in circumstances in which they do not have a feel for it, warmth for it or compassion for it, perhaps because there are so many other things on their agendas. For children with special educational needs, their families and parents who are exhausted and war-weary, it is time for the State to implement an administrative change by moving responsibility to another Department. Certainly, I hope the Taoiseach will talk less about tax cuts and more about investment in children and families. As others have done, I condemn absolutely those who last night vandalised the monument to those Irishmen, mainly, who died in the First World War. Family members of mine are buried at Gallipoli and the Somme. The Ó Ríordáins were once the Riordans but my great grandfather, who was a tailor in the British Army, inserted an "Ó" to emphasise his Irishness. I have family members who fought in the Easter Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War. I would not wear a poppy or a lily, but anyone who decides to paint on or desecrate a monument of that nature, as happened last night, insults every single Irishman and Irishwoman in this State and across the globe. It is gratifying and comforting to know that people from across the House have prioritised that message this morning and are stating collectively that we want to remember those who have fallen in war and ensure we never make those mistakes again.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Before I make my comments, I am a bit taken aback by the language that has been used in the Chamber-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am a bit taken aback by the language that has been used on the proposed injecting centre. I do not believe public representatives, Members of the Oireachtas or anybody in public life should use a phrase like "dumping" when it comes to life-saving interventions such as will be available in an injecting centre. We are dealing with people who suffer from addiction and who are generally at the very lowest end of the political priority list. There tends to be name-calling in media circles on the issue. It is unbecoming of a Member of the Oireachtas to suggest in the Chamber that the establishment of an injecting centre, which will save lives, prevent the spread of hepatitis C and HIV and prevent overdoses, and which have prevented overdoses, including fatal overdoses, wherever they exist across Europe and the world, is being dumped anywhere. When we are dealing with vulnerable communities and people who are vulnerable, could we please not use language like that? I find it offensive. I will raise two issues. One is the issue of policing. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is celebrating the pending opening of his pet project of Stepaside Garda station, which is of interest to us on the north side who deal with issues of antisocial behaviour and policing daily. I dealt with an issue of antisocial behaviour in Beaumont recently which is hurting the community there. I ask that the Minister for Justice and Equality would come to the House to justify his policy on Garda stations and to talk about the policing issues we on the north side have with crime and antisocial behaviour.I ask that he also address the issue of the need for a Garda station in the Belmayne-Clongriffin area, seeing as it is a population centre that could house as many as 50,000 people in the coming years. I wish to impress on the Leader the need for the Minister for Health to come before the House to discuss any number of issues concerning prescription drugs and drugs that are needed to save the lives of people with various ailments. The issue of cervical cancer has been in the media in recent days, and justifiably so, but the issue of the drug Spinraza has not gone away. Children and young people who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy are facing into a winter which their parents and loved ones are concerned they might not survive. They need Spinraza. It is absolutely essential that it be provided to them and at this stage I feel it is time for the Minister for Health to come into the Chamber to address this issue specifically.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party supports this Bill, as it did on the previous Stage. I congratulate Senator Black and the Civil Engagement group on bringing forward this legislation. Whenever we speak in this Chamber of the rise of right-wing rhetoric and populism across the world, countries such as America, the UK, Hungary, Poland and Italy are mentioned but nobody ever mentions Israel. Remarkably, from a pretty low base it has managed in the past number of years to make things even worse. The Jewish people - a proud people wherever they have been - have always been viewed as the enemy within. They have a proud community where I live and there is a Jewish cemetery around the corner from me. They are a proud people viewed as the enemy within, a reviled people, and yet that is exactly what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people. It views them as the enemy within. That is why we support the Bill and why we will continue to support the Palestinian people. It is why we will continue to join others to ensure that Israel is eventually treated as South Africa was in the past. It is only with collective international action that Israel will change its attitude and practices with its outright disgraceful treatment of international law.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter. I refer to an Educate Together national school in Dún Laoghaire and the need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Cholmcille on Oscar Traynor Road. Representations have been made by Councillor Deirdre Kingston of the Labour Party in Dún Laoghaire asking for progress in the acquisition of a permanent site for a new Educate Together national school in Dún Laoghaire. It is currently located in temporary accommodation which is not fit for purpose. It is cramped for students and not a very positive learning environment. There are no indoor facilities or spaces in which to engage in exercise or movement, with the result that in bad weather children must remain in the classroom for the entire school day.Furthermore, the temporary accommodation is located beside a special school for children on the autism spectrum. We will need to consider the impact more children starting next year and more noise will have on their learning experience. The school is located on a small residential road and traffic is a problem now. Next year there will be bigger numbers. The area immediately around the school is also very unsuitable and unsafe when walking with young children. There are missing pathways, no safe crossings and narrow roads, on which traffic reverses.  Councillor Kingston understands the Department has been reviewing a site for about a year. The question we are asking is where is this site and when does the Minister expect construction to begin. Furthermore, the Department recently bought a site in Blackrock. For what will it be used? Will it be used for the new Dún Laoghaire school? It is important that the Minister prioritise this site and move to tender stage. The demand for school places in Dún Laoghaire is huge and every year parents are worried about what school their child will be able to get into. We need to do all we can to meet demand and ensure every child will be assured of a school place in his or her community. I appreciate that the Minister of State is here to discuss the Educate Together school in Dún Laoghaire and look forward to hearing his response, but I wish to refer to Gaelscoil Cholmcille on Oscar Traynor Road. I was in the school yesterday for the celebration of Bliain na Gaeilge. The children's celebration of music and song was incredible. Wonderful work is ongoing in the school which has been waiting for a permanent building for 22 years. While I appreciate the Minister of State is here to talk about the Educate Together school in Dún Laoghaire, this issue is still ongoing and I would appreciate hearing his comments on it. Perhaps he might ask the Minister what can be done about it. However, we will concentrate this morning on the Educate Together school in Dún Laoghaire.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I appreciate that officials are working hard to secure the site and engaged with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to facilitate its acquisition. The Minister of State might be in a position to clarify whether the site acquired in Blackrock is earmarked for Dún Laoghaire Educate Together national school. I also ask him to pass on to the Minister my comments on Gaelscoil Cholmcille on Oscar Traynor Road. I appreciate that these issues are difficult. I also know that departmental officials are doing their absolute best, but the school does not want to engage in a campaign that will last five, ten or 15 years. I appreciate that officials are working hard, but the parents are hoping the goodwill behind the establishment of the school will not turn sour when people do not see movement. I ask the Minister of State to facilitate a discussion between the Minister and the board of management of Gaelscoil Cholmcille.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis an Aire féin as a bheith anseo go pearsanta chun an t-ábhar seo a phlé liom. An tseachtain seo caite bhí mé istigh i nGaelscoil Cholmcille. Bhíodar ag ceiliúradh Bliain na Gaeilge agus bhí mé an-tógtha leis an méid a bhí ar siúl ann, idir cheol, drámaíocht agus amhránaíocht. Gach uair a bhím i láthair sa scoil ar Bhóthar Oscar Traynor cuireann an fhoireann ar fad ina luí orm go bhfuil sé thar am dóibh foirgneamh buan a bheith acu. Tá siad ag feitheamh anois níos mó ná 20 bliain. Cé go raibh an méid sin amhránaíochta agus drámaíochta agus ceol ar siúl ag na páistí, bhí sé soiléir do gach duine go raibh na háiseanna agus an halla atá acu i bhfad ró-bheag don scoil sin. Tá an scoil ag iarraidh fáis agus dul i méid agus tá an-chuid daoine ag iarraidh a bheith ag freastal ar an scoil ach tá an scoil ag fanacht níos mó ná 20 bliain ar fhoirgneamh nua. Gaelscoil Cholmcille is doing fantastic work. It is a very popular local primary school. Last week I visited the school again and it was impressed upon me once more the fact it is waiting more than 20 years for a permanent building. There is a site next door which Dublin City Council has plans to develop. The long-term solution is right there facing the school. The school is adamant that a process be put in place and that it would have a chance to maximise its potential as a primary school. I know the Minister will share with me his vision that every child will attend a school with a permanent building and can look to the future with a level of confidence. The confidence within the school has been ebbing away over the last number of years. When there are announcements of new schools being developed and recognised - nobody has an issue with this - this school seems to be on the end of the list when it comes to achieving what it wants to achieve. I am interested in hearing the Minister's reply. While he is new to his post, the Irish language is of particular importance to him and he wants to do what is best for everyone. On behalf of the parents, staff and board of management of Gaelscoil Cholmcille, I note that a positive response would be greatly appreciated.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire. Unfortunately, I find the answer disappointing. The Minister can appreciate how disappointing it is from the school's point of view, having waited so long for a permanent building only to get an indication from the Department that it does not foresee an opportunity to replace the building because it is a two-storey semi-permanent structure with a lifespan of 25 to 30 years. I accept what the Minister says about the two permanent classrooms but I note that there is a site beside the school which is to be developed by Dublin City Council. It is a major development with potential for 500 housing units. There is a perfect opportunity here for the Department to engage with Dublin City Council regarding the site in order to find a permanent answer for the needs of this school. I implore the Minister. To say that a temporary building has a 25 to 30-year lifespan, considering that it is already ten years old, does not provide much succour to the people who care about the school. I ask that the Department engages with Dublin City Council to find a long-term solution for this much-loved and needed school in this community. I ask the Minister to engage more imaginatively to find a permanent solution. This school and its current and future pupils deserve no less.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I concur with Senator Bacik's comments. In terms of the amendments to which she refers, many were written before the closure of Grafton College. Often on this side of the House we table amendments and are accused of doing so to try to prevent events that will never happen. We are often told we are scare-mongering, that what we fear will never come to pass, that the sector is well regulated and so forth. Today in the Public Gallery we have people who literally have no job in the run-up to Christmas. They are now engaging with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in order to get payments to survive over the Christmas period because a hand-written note was put on the door of the educational institution in which they worked. When we table amendments, we are not doing so to cause trouble or to try to embarrass anybody. We are doing it because we know these sectors well and are trying to protect workers' rights. I know the Minister of State will appreciate that and will work with us to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I take this opportunity to recognise the presence of the teachers from Grafton College in the Gallery. They are at the coalface in the context of this issue. In support of Senator Ruane's comments about the process and how we reached this point, I see no reason the Government or any particular party should have difficulty with workers rights being peppered through every item of legislation. A frustration felt by my party, which is shared by others, is the Government's sense of taking the employers' best goodwill as a given at all times. Recently, I had a meeting with an education NGO which pointed out the number of educational bodies that have trade union representation compared with employer representation. The trade union representation on the bodies was paltry compared to that of employers. Senator Norris has articulated the point very well that all we are doing is trying to protect the workers in the colleges. That needs to be done via legislation. I do not understand why that would challenge or upset people or make them uneasy. Ministers will be advised that it is unnecessary and over the top and that it is implicit in other employment legislation. However, one cannot say that to the people sitting in the Gallery. Last weekend, these people saw a noted pinned to the door of the institution at which they taught telling them that it was over. They are now looking forward to Christmas without employment. They have children that they need to look after and feed. No Minister can say that employment rights or workers rights can ever be overstated in any legislation. They cannot. The Minister of State might not agreed but I believe that the market has no conscience. When dealing with a market economy with no conscience, one must regulate it within an inch of its existence or else situations such as that experienced by the people in the Gallery will arise. Companies will do what they will to survive and make money. It is people such as those with us this evening who endure the fallout. Labour tabled its amendment, and Senator Ruane did likewise, prior to this controversy arising. We are not reacting or doing anything on the basis of having held a meeting today or there being media attention on a particular situation that arose at the weekend. The position has been highlighted by unions such as Unite, which helped to draft these amendments.The unions see this industry as unregulated and the workers therein as being potentially exploited and certainly vulnerable. Nobody can accuse us in this Chamber of knee-jerk reactions to a particularly newsworthy issue because these amendments were tabled some time ago. The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and the Government should not be opposed to what we are seeking to achieve today. Amendment No. 59 states:(8) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a code of practice established under that subsection shall specify requirements relating to compliance with quality standards for the recruitment, employment and cessation of employment of employees, and with employment law generally, by relevant providers.(9) In specifying requirements of the type referred to in subsection (8), the Authority shall consult, in such manner as it thinks fit, with trade unions or staff associations that represent education and training staff or other employees of relevant providers.".".We are trying to do the right thing. I know that the Minister of State is also trying to do the right thing. We may have different interpretations of what is the best legislation that can come out of this House but surely the Minister of State is aware of what is wrong with this industry and it is her responsibility to fix it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On a point of order, out of respect for the workers who are present this evening and who would like to see the Seanad working in their favour, we should allow these amendments, at least, to be voted on this evening. We would greatly appreciate even ten or 15 minutes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 59:In page 33, line 20, to delete “appropriate.”.” and substitute the following:“appropriate.”,and(c) by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (7):“(8) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a code of practice established under that subsection shall specify requirements relating to compliance with quality standards for the recruitment, employment and cessation of employment of employees, and with employment law generally, by relevant providers.(9) In specifying requirements of the type referred to in subsection (8), the Authority shall consult, in such manner as it thinks fit, with trade unions or staff associations that represent education and training staff or other employees of relevant providers.”.”.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for being here. This is an emotional day. I share the emotion of my colleague and friend, Senator Humphreys, when he apologised. I feel the same need to show a sense of shame as an Irish man for what has been done to Irish women and continues to be done to them to this day. I join others in commending my colleague, Senator Bacik, who for years has campaigned on this issue. It was often a very lonely struggle, both inside and outside the Labour Party, to convince people like me and the people of Ireland of the great wrong that was done in 1983. She has been threatened with jail and received all sorts of vile communications over the years but she has never resiled from her absolute belief in the necessity for the Republic to live up to its name and deliver on gender equality in every single aspect of life. I am tempted to be drawn into making this debate about the men of the "No" campaign who continue to utter misogynistic comments to try to shame and misrepresent what the vote of the people was about. We saw the antics in the Dáil. We have begun to hear unfortunate language being used again today in this Chamber. This cannot be about the men of the "No" campaign no matter how much they want to make it about them and how upset they are that their life's work is crumbling before their eyes. This has to be about the women of Ireland, the mistakes we have made, the shame we have thrust upon them and the journeys we continue to force on them. I can only speak as someone who is proud to stand in the Oireachtas today and feels a sense of the washing away of the sins of the past. Perhaps we did not know the country very well. I do not know if people in the Chamber have begun to look at their country and all the things we thought we were. We are now not what we thought we were. In Europe and the world, when we look left and right, we observe Brexit, Trump and the rise of right-wing populism across Europe. We thought our country was a conservative backwater that would never embrace the idea of LGBT rights, women's rights or reproductive rights and would never descend to racist race card immigration debates at a time of election. In some bizarre way, the island on which I grew up in the 1980s is a beacon of light for progressive minded people across the world. I will never know what it is like to be pregnant. I know people who I love deeply who have gone through pregnancy and suggest it is the most profound thing any woman will go through. It takes over one's body, mind and spirit. It dominates every ounce of one's being for nine months until birth and every waking moment after that. It is and has always been monstrous to suggest one would take that decision lightly, that women take it lightly or should go through it, or be forced through it, against their will.  I do not intend to speak on every Stage of the debate. I do not intend to say more. I do not want to lengthen the debate because we have debated it inside and out. Many people have been discussing it for 30 years. Some of us are newer to the debate, having joined it in the past few years. The country went through it in May and made its decision clear. There are elements of the Bill with which I am not comfortable. The three-day waiting period is an insult to women but it was part of the debate on the referendum. If it was part of the debate in the referendum and people voted "Yes" on that basis, it has to be in the Bill. We can amend it at a later stage.  I have a seven month old girl called Anna. She has now been born into a republic where she is something approaching less than a second class citizen. She is now a full citizen of this republic. She has absolute autonomy over her own body to do what she will with her own body at any stage of her life. On her behalf, because she cannot speak yet, I thank Members of the Oireachtas, citizens, young and old campaigners and, particularly, the young women with Repeal jumpers who were derided by media outlets and seasoned journalists who thought they knew it all. They said it was not the way Irish politics worked and that these young women did not understand Ireland or its nature. It was fearless, compassionate and determined - mostly young - women proudly displaying their Repeal jumpers who changed the country and possibly made the entire world look at itself and this country in a different light. I say, "Well done," to them. I am proud to live in a country with them. Let us get the legislation passed and ensure we do not wake up on a day in January on which another 12 women have to make the lonely Ryanair journey to England to get what they deserve in their own country.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue of conscientious objection is dealt with comprehensively in the Bill but as Senator Bacik has said, if we are to envisage a situation where a woman is in a room with a doctor and she is distraught and in clear need of a service available as legislated for and as voted for by the people of this country, are we really going to focus our attention on what the doctor is feeling rather than on the woman? Is that the intent of these amendments? Surely at this stage in our development as a republic, in that very troubling, traumatic and deeply distressing situation the woman and her needs should, first and foremost, be our focus. I find it ironic in the extreme that a facade of Christianity is placed over the whole idea of conscientious objection because it is coming from the same stable that would refuse the rights of teachers to conscientious objection when they are asked at interview if they will uphold the religious ethos of the school. We can be very sure their chances of advancement in the teaching profession will be really stunted if they were to suggest they have a conscientious objection to what they are being asked by a board of management or a principal.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The child to which Senator Mullen referred is mine. I will say this much about my daughter, thank God she has been born in this year in order that in years to come she will live within an ideology of care and compassion for women, not the judgmental views of Senators such as Mullen and Ó Domhnaill which would send her across the waves for the care that she needs, feeling like a criminal. Thankfully, in this year we have had a referendum andare passing legislation that brings her closer to being an equal citizen in this republic, not a second-class citizen which those Senators would have her remain.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I second the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate on anti-social behaviour in the Beaumont area. I am always reluctant to discuss matters of anti-social behaviour in a public forum because it does not necessarily lead to a good outcome and can stigmatise an area if not done sensitively, but the issues at hand have got to such a degree that I feel my hand has been forced. There is an estate called Collinswood, and in that estate is a laneway that leads to the main Beaumont Road. In that laneway, a number of incidents have happened, including multiple muggings, and there is a general sense of danger and intimidation. A number of individuals have been intimidated in the wider estate and a gang seems to be going around the place causing havoc. After a public meeting that I organised, a number of other people from around the area have contacted me. One told me that her son had been the subject of a 45-minute mugging in August. There was the well publicised case of a 13 year old boy who was assaulted and had his bike taken from him just outside Beaumont Hospital. Another individual contacted me to say that his wife, when intervening alongside their daughter in a mugging in the same area, had her shoulder broken. There seems to have been an escalation in anti-social behaviour in and around the Beaumont area in recent months. I have met senior Garda management, which is familiar with the issues and is trying in whatever way it can to respond to them. I have no issue with the response or determination of the Garda to sort out the problem, but the question inevitably comes back to the resources the Garda in that area has, be it at Raheny Garda station, Clontarf Garda station or Santry Garda station. A point raised by a resident is that Santry Garda station closes at 7.30 p.m. A large amount of Government time, energy and resources have been put into the reopening of Stepaside Garda station. I do not know what kind of criminality or anti-social behaviour is happening in Stepaside to warrant that amount of resources and political attention, but the area I am discussing, which I live near and which I am trying to represent to the best of my ability, is in need of special attention to root out this problem and ensure people can live quiet lives without a sense of intimidation hanging over them and the area in which they live. It is a proud and good area with decent people who are just trying to live their lives. If it were not for the seriousness of the issues and the fact that they are being raised time and again, I would not necessarily be standing here and talking about them, as I am often reluctant to go public with an issue and name a particular district. I want the Minister of State to respond positively to what I am outlining and commit to providing more resources so that gardaí can patrol the area better and give a sense of security to people living locally, allowing them to go about their daily business without the threat of intimidation or assault hanging over them.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unfortunately, I am not overly impressed by the Minister of State's response. An Garda Síochána says it needs more resources and that this requires political decision but when one raises the issue with political masters they say it is an issue for the Garda Commissioner. The assistant Garda commissioner said Stepaside Garda station was not a priority, yet the Government is proceeding to reopen it. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to impress on the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the seriousness of what is happening in this area in terms of the number of muggings and assaults on young people, leaving them traumatised. I recently sat in the kitchen of the home of one young man traumatised by the ordeal he had to endure, which was a 45 minute assault. It is appalling that the Minister of State's response is that it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide where policing resources are allocated. I suggest that greater emphasis needs to be put on policing in the north Dublin area, with less obsession on the reopening of Stepaside Garda station.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I genuinely want to ask the Leader for a debate with anybody in government who can justify the new confidence and supply agreement. It reminds me of when a mother used to come home having left her child to tidy up the house. Nothing would have been cleaned up and she would ask, "What have you been doing for the last number of hours?" We have had high level negotiations between two crack teams from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for six weeks-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Two crack teams. Two teams of the highest calibre.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The best negotiators they could find, three from each side, in secret negotiations over a period of months-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They came out with not even a sheet of paper between them.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The frustrating thing, as the Leader will agree, is that this country faces a huge number of challenges - Brexit, homelessness, housing and the health crisis, which have all been mentioned today.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it not unbelievable that the two main parties in the Oireachtas could have six weeks of negotiations and not come up with a single sheet of paper with a single word written on it? If they had a single sheet of paper with the word "homelessness" written on it, at least we could have an argument over and back as to the importance of that word or what they are going to do about it. However, they literally came up with nothing. We are being governed on the basis of nothing. We had an agreement that went up to the budget last year. Water was the most important issue two and a half years ago and it took up the vast bulk of that agreement. Now, we have a crisis of homelessness and, after six weeks of negotiations, not even a sheet of paper emerges. It is unbelievable. Somebody from the Government should come in here to account for it. On a more positive note, I would like to debate in this House the nature of female participation in sport by girls and women. Anybody who observed the RTÉ sports awards at the weekend will see that massive advances are being made in female participation in sport, which is to be remarked upon and encouraged. There is a campaign, 20x20, which is seeking a 20% increase in funding, a 20% increase in participation and a 20% increase in coverage of women's sport by 2020. It would be a good idea to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the House to discuss the issue and the 20x20 campaign and to see what politics can do to help that agenda for female participation in sport by girls and women.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is that what the Senator was shouting at me?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Was he shouting that at me earlier? I could not really make out what he was saying.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Leader has said that three times now.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Throw in a grenade - go on.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«"B" is for boo.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Some of us have Christmas shopping to do.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was watching proceedings in my office.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I got 18,000.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister of State coming to the House to take this matter.  The area of Clongriffin and Belmayne is growing in size, as is the population. Renewed plans are frequently put in place for the expansion of that entire community and a population of 50,000 is projected in the coming years. We are effectively talking about a population on the scale of a large town, if not a small city. A number of years ago I had a debate in this Chamber with the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, about the need for a new secondary school in that area. At the time I was told by the Minister that it was not necessary and that the population did not warrant it. Within 18 months the Department had changed its mind, having looked at the population trends and the projected population, and granted the establishment of a new second level school in the area. Thankfully, Educate Together is to be awarded patronage and the school is to open in September. I make that point purely because we believe a Garda station would benefit policing, security and bring about a sense of community in that community. There is what we might call a Garda clinic which takes place in one of the rooms of the Junction Community Centre in Clongriffin. On a Saturday, gardaí sign forms, do basic Garda work and are available to assist the community. An Garda Síochána is doing the best it can with the resources it has to serve the community in whatever way it can. Clearly a Garda presence of that nature is seen to be needed in that area. This area is growing in size. In the past politicians have been criticised for not engaging in forward planning. We build residential units but we do not build a community around those residential units to serve them. I am saying at this early stage that there is a need for a Garda station, just as I said two years ago that there was a need for a new second level school. The campaigners and I were proved to be correct and we managed to be successful in that endeavour. I know that Government policy has changed in the past few years, moving away from stationary Garda stations and emphasising the transportation of gardaí in vehicles, on bikes and in cars. I appreciate that move. However, given the scale of this community, the size of the population and the number expected to move into that area, at the very least, a positive response from the Minister of State's Department on looking at establishing a Garda station in the area, one that can work with the new communities, give advice to planners on how best to construct new residential entities and with transport links, etc., would be of huge benefit to what I am sure he will accept is a large town, if not effectively a small city, being built on the outskirts of Dublin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister of State's response but I do not accept it. It is nonsense to suggest to this House or me that it is the role of the Garda Commissioner to make these decisions when we all know that a member of the Cabinet is well able to trumpet that he apparently was successful in reopening Stepaside Garda station. He is also willing to tell all his constituents as often as he possibly can that it was his intervention that made that happen. For the Minister of State to suggest there was no political interference or influence on that decision is a statement of an untruth. I know that it certainly went against the advice of the assistant Garda Commissioner. As was stated in the Houses of the Oireachtas, he was not in favour of it and did not believe it was a proper use of Garda resources. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to tell me that this issue has nothing to do with the Government when it has. I have advised the Minister of State that the Government stated two years ago that there was not a need for a secondary school in the Clongriffin-Belmayne area and now it has stated a school is needed. A Garda station is also needed in the locality because of the projected population. I am sure that in years to come somebody in the Minister of State's position will inform the House that the Government has changed its mind in that regard. I ask the Minister of State to stop telling us that this is not a political decision when clearly it is. Will he review the priorities of the Department to take account of this new population centre and give it the service it clearly needs?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I propose an amendment to the Order of Business - one of my colleagues on the Independent benches will second the proposal - that No. 22, Public Sector (Plain Language) Bill 2019 - First Stage, introduced by the Labour Party with the support of the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, be taken before No. 1. To add briefly to what has been said, people should realise nobody takes industrial action lightly. Whatever opinion people might have about the pay claim, those who suggest nurses or anybody else would go out on strike on a whim need to realise withdrawing one's labour is probably the most serious action a worker will ever take. No worker takes it lightly. That should be respected. My view and that of my Labour Party colleagues is that we support the action that will be taken by the nurses tomorrow. People should realise that when industrial action reaches strike action something has gone seriously wrong. I hope they will appreciate that when making comments about the action being taken tomorrow.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I was not referring to a Member of this Chamber.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move:That leave be given to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to improve access to public sector information and services by requiring plain writing in published documents; and to provide for connected matters.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next Tuesday.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Mr. Horan is most welcome. It shows the respect he is giving to the Chamber that so many members of his family are present to witness his address. It says a lot about the seriousness with which he is taking the occasion. It is also great to see Mr. Alan Milton here. I saw him in Clones on Sunday. My memory of him in UCD in the 1990s is that he was more of a Liverpool fan than anything else, but I hope that will not impinge on his career path in the GAA. I welcome Mr. John Costello and very much expect that we will be renaming Collins Avenue after him and that in years to come, as he travels from Whitehall Colmcille GAA Club to Parnell Park, he will be walking along Costello Avenue. I want to reflect on the themes covered in Mr. Horan's address which were absolutely excellent. He spoke about community, health, the importance of sport for mind and body and education, gambling and alcohol, the global reach of the GAA, gender equality, pitches going from grey to green and voluntarism. I do not come from a GAA background. I fell in love with the GAA mainly because of the Dubs in the 1990s. It was a hard sell in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I remember the time when I found a job on Sheriff Street in the early 2000s in a school with no yard and no background in the GAA. I had just qualified as a primary school teacher and had been trained at foundation level as a GAA coach. I attended a function at the time with the then president of the GAA, Mr. Sean McCague, and had the idea of forming a girls' Gaelic football team in the school. When I asked Mr. McCague if he could help, he asked what I wanted. I told him that I would love to have a set of gear. He then asked what colour. Two weeks' later he turned up to present us with the most beautiful green and white gear. We were successful in five Cumann na mBunscoil championships. For children with no place to train in their community or no club for which they could play, that investment by the GAA was inspiring. Mr. Horan spoke about the maintenance of green spaces, with which I absolutely agree. This is not the time at which to make political speeches, but the strategic housing development Act needs to be re-examined. What needs to be investigated is how developments can proceed to An Bord Pleanála without cognisance being taken of local zoning. Z15 in Dublin City Council is under threat, as are pitches within the confines of institutional lands. We saw what happened at Clonkeen College in Dún Laoghaire and St. Anne's Park. The point is relevant. There is an overdependence on pitches on land owned by religious orders or other institutions. We must be conscious of this. Pay-per-view has been mentioned. Anybody with an elderly family member who has a great love for the GAA but who cannot attend matches and does not have a Sky subscription knows that pay-per-view is a barrier. It is something on which the GAA should reflect. Knowing it as I do, the reality is that we know the money taken at the gate and pay-per-view income go back into the association.Everyone accepts this. However, once a barrier becomes the difference between someone attending and not attending a match or between someone watching and not watching at home on television, it has to be re-examined. Mr. Horan referred to State funding. Our side of the House must examine that issue. The influence of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund on the body politic is remarkable. Unquestionably, the only ring-fenced funding in Irish politics is that fund. It amounts to €56 million per year. A proportion of every bet placed on anything goes straight into the fund. No other sports organisation has absolute certainty of ring-fenced Exchequer funding every year. Considering what the GAA does for this country, the moneys Mr. Horan has mentioned are paltry compared with the unquestioned €56 million or so per year that goes into the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. I wish to discuss gender equality. I am heavily involved on the ladies side in Scoil Uí Chonaill, Clontarf. We should examine possibilities for gender accessibility at GAA grounds. I wrote to Croke Park about making sanitary products free in every GAA ground. I also wrote about breastfeeding facilities and taking a more sympathetic view towards parents attending games with infant children. I had an issue with this myself only last year when I was refused entry to Croke Park because I had an infant in my company. If we are to encourage a family-friendly environment and gender accessibility at county grounds and promote facilities, these suggestions need to be considered. As the Cathaoirleach is facilitating me, I will make my final point. Regarding the integration of non-Irish populations, Mr. Horan referred to the GAA abroad. At a school in Carrickmacross 50% of the infant intake are non-Irish born or have parents who are non-Irish born. How are we utilising the GAA network? In many communities, if someone is not involved in the GAA, he or she is missing out because it is the lifeblood of those communities. In conjunction with the body politic, the Department of Justice and Equality and whoever else, how can the GAA facilitate a mechanism whereby those children can enter into the GAA family? While we are all lauding Mr. Horan's presence, if someone does not have a father, grandfather or great-grandfather involved in a local club, it can be difficult to enter into that space and become an equal member. That is a fair comment to make. Having said that, a French lady won player of the year with our junior B side at Scoil Uí Chonaill. There is evidence it can work.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise the issue of policing and anti-social behaviour on the north side of Dublin. I am getting increasing exasperated with the failure to get any answers in this Chamber. I tabled a Commencement matter on anti-social behaviour issues, muggings and the escalation of violence in the Dublin 9 area and the Minister who replied to the matter told me that the Minister had no direct responsibility for the area and that it was an issue for the Garda Commissioner. I then raised in another debate the potential for the opening of a Garda station in the expanding Clongriffin-Balmayne area, which will have 50,000 residents in a number of years, and again I was told it was an issue for the Garda Commissioner. Now I have asked this week for a debate after a pipe bomb incident in Edenmore last Sunday, following a gun attack in a pizza parlour in Edenmore on New Year's eve, only to be told by the Leas-Chathaoirleach that I cannot have it because the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. I am getting sick and tired of this kind of response. We all hear from a Minister in government in Stepaside who tells every resident that can hear him that it was his intervention that opened up a Garda station in that plush affluent suburb-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----against the express advice of an assistant Garda commissioner. Yet when we have had a pipe bomb incident and an attempted murder in a pizza parlour in Edenmore, I am told by the Leas-Chathaoirleach's office that the Garda Commissioner is the person responsible and the Minister for Justice and Equality has no responsibility for it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am damn sure that if there was a pipe bomb in Laois or in south Dublin, the Minister would be all over it.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Last week in this Chamber I was critical of the Minister for Justice and Equality in terms of the inability of Senators to get an adequate debate on Garda resources and the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality over An Garda Síochána as a result of a number of incidents that happened on the north side of Dublin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I cited the issue of a pipe bomb in Edenmore and the upsurge in anti-social behaviour. Since I made that contribution last week, we have had a fatal shooting in Darndale. In his response to my request for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I appreciate the Leader was minded to do that. I want to get an assurance from him that he will see to that request. I have expressed my frustration at an inability to get further than the suggestion that the Minister has no responsibility for operational matters in An Garda Síochána. I encourage the Leader to arrange such a debate in the House and to see how we can work together to ensure that people in communities across the city, northside, southside, outside Dublin and across the country, can feel safe and secure. It is not normal for somebody to be shot dead at 6.30 a.m. and then for children in that community to go to school as if it is something perfectly normal and for it not to feature that heavily in the news cycle of that day. When an incident occurs where somebody gets shot dead at 6.30 a.m. and it does not rock the foundations of these Houses, then something has gone very badly wrong. I suggest, respectfully, and perhaps I was not respectful last week-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«-----that we would have a debate in this House with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue of crime, criminality, anti-social behaviour and fatal shootings.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Was it a junior counsel?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise the issue of the details of the asylum claim of Ellie Kisyombe, a local election candidate for the Social Democrats in the north inner city, being splashed on the front page of a national newspaper last Sunday. I find it disturbing that, out of approximately 1,000 candidates hoping to contest the local elections in May, this woman was selected for investigation by the newspaper and made the subject of a front page story. The newspaper could only have obtained the information on which the article is based from a leak in the Department of Justice and Equality. Will the Leader request the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to come to the House to discuss this disturbing matter to allow him the opportunity to deny that the information came from the Department? I formed part of a panel with Ms Kisyombe some weeks ago and I said it was quite brave of her to put her name forward because it would open her life and situation to intense scrutiny. That is exactly what has happened. Official Ireland has found a way to try to put her back in her box by means of a screaming headline on the front page of a supposedly reputable newspaper. This House should not stand for it. There is a line that we cannot cross. The picketing of politicians' private homes is out of line and so is fishing into the personal details of a person's story and leaking them to a newspaper. The Minister for Justice and Equality should address the House on this issue. If it happened to Ellie Kisyombe, it could happen to anybody who seeks public office or anybody in the direct provision system who wishes to speak about the conditions in or the reality of that system. In recent years, this House has had a proud cross-party tradition, regardless of political allegiances, of Senators on the Government side and the Opposition speaking out about the injustices of the direct provision system. I can only imagine the horror Ms Kisyombe felt when she was singled out by a newspaper, having decided to run for election. A line has been crossed. The Minister or his representatives should come to the House to discuss whether a leak emanated from the Department, which is my suspicion. If that is so-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If the Leader thinks it an outlandish suggestion-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That may be so, but I was interrupted.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Personal information regarding an asylum seeker ended up on the front page of a newspaper. That information was held within the Department of Justice and Equality. If the Leader contends that it is outlandish to suggest that the information was leaked, he does not know the Department as well as I do. The Minister should be given the opportunity to come to the House and tell us that the information was not leaked by the Department.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise two issues. I have just come from a demonstration outside Leinster House by parents whose children suffer from spinal muscular atrophy. It does not affect many children but those who it does are severely affected. As the Leader will know, I am raising the issue of Spinraza. There was a devastating announcement this week that the HSE has decided not to proceed with allowing Spinraza to be readily available. One would have to have a heart of stone not to be affected by the stories of the parents who gathered outside this morning. They told of the effects Spinraza can have and the fact that 25 of 28 European Union countries have made Spinraza available for children who require it. Only Ireland, the UK and Estonia have not done so. If children such as Grace O'Malley from Mayo or Sam Bailey from Dublin - I know Sam's family quite well - lived in any country other than Ireland, the UK or Estonia, they might have a better quality of life. I do not believe anybody in the Government has a heart of stone. I hope the announcement this week is just a blip on the road rather than a full stop. Members across the House have raised the issue of Spinraza in recent months and years. I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House to address the availability of this drug. In fairness, I do not think anybody in government wants to see children suffer. I know everybody in politics wants to do their best. However, there was a sense that things were slowly progressing to a point when Spinraza would be made available, but that seems to have come to a shuddering halt. On that basis, I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, or the Minister of State with responsibility for disability in regard to Spinraza. I note with alarm the issue of the discharge from the sewage treatment plant in Ringsend last weekend. I note it with alarm because it only came to public awareness as a result of a drone taking a photograph of the leakage. It raises concerns for me regarding the sewage treatment plant which is planned for the Clonshaugh area.If that is the type of issue that takes place in a sewage treatment plant, what can the residents in Clonshaugh expect if and when this plant is built? It is only a proposal. It has not been finalised. I believe the plan should be scrapped and that the land should be used for housing because it is a greater need. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment should come to the House to explain how this fault happened, the reasons that it was not reported immediately and that it took a number of days for communications from different agencies to take place; to allay the fears of Dubliners about that plant; and to justify why residents in Clonshaugh should feel any less worried about the proposal to build a water treatment plant there, which I believe is the wrong place and should be used for different ends. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter. There has been recent media coverage about issues relating to boom time construction. I have been dealing with a group of residents in the Belmayne area. I am reluctant to name particular areas because of the reputational damage doing so can cause but we are at the stage where the relevant information is in media circles. It is time for action.The Irish Times reported this week about apartments in Clongriffin and about owners facing a bill of €826,000 to remedy serious fire safety issues found at their block. Residents have been informed that fire would not be contained within any compartment of the building for more than 30 minutes - rather than the 60 minutes required under the regulations - and the owners will have to pay between €4,246 and €6,676 per apartment to remedy the defects. A letter was recently circulated as a result of a public meeting I organised with my colleague, Mr. Shane Folan, in Belmayne. The letter was sent by the management company to residents. It outlined that the management company was due to proceed with an immediate fire safety inspection and it intended to complete a further survey of the balconies in the block. The management company has accepted that the balconies are defective. Further surveys will identify what repair work is required. The residents want to know who is on their side. There is any amount of overlapping interest between management companies, developers, Dublin City Council and the fire officer. The residents want to know if the Government is on their side. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is suggesting that the Government establish an emergency fund in order to assist these residents. I presume the Minister of State will agree that the owners of apartments which are proven to be defective should not be left out of pocket. Some of these residents have already been obliged to dish out €3,000 in order to find out if their apartments were affected by pyrite. These residents are victims of boom time construction which has proven to be defective. They want to know if the Government is going to be on their side. Is the Government going to advocate for them or is it going to wash its hands of this matter? At the time of the Priory Hall issue, the former leader of the Labour Party and former Deputy, Eamon Gilmore, was proactive in meeting and talking with residents and anybody who could find solutions to that situation. We eventually found a solution, although not before a significant amount of hurt and upset were caused.One man was driven to take his own life at that time. I have met residents of the area repeatedly and they are under an understandable amount of stress. They wish and hope that the Government can assist them by providing some support and can be on their side. I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on the suggestion by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland that an emergency fund be established by Government to assist residents who, through no fault of their own, are out of pocket and living in apartments which are clearly not safe. Someone else is at fault here and I will be interested in hearing the Minister of State's response. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State. Unfortunately I am disappointed with his reply. I accept that the Department is doing as much as it can for future developments.From the Minister of State's answer it seems that while residents face dealing with a series of overlapping agencies including the city council, the fire officer, the developer and the management companies, the Department is effectively sidestepping and saying it cannot intervene. I impress upon the Minister of State the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland's suggestion of an emergency fund to ensure that residents are not out of pocket. The Department must take this suggestion seriously. It does not come from me, but from an eminent organisation. If I was one of these apartment owners living in Belmayne or Clongriffin, I would want to feel that the Department was not neutral or on the sidelines but actively engaged, concerned and trying to do something about it. Unfortunately, I do not get this impression from the Minister of State's answers. I would impress on him again, and on the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that this is and should be their concern. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government must be cognisant of this. I find it ironic when the Minister criticises me and people like me for casting a critical eye over planning applications that reach our desks. This is what happens when due diligence is not carried out. Ten years later we find ourselves looking at a situation like this because a developer with a profit motive went into an area, built a couple of apartment blocks and was never seen again, leaving a management company to pick up the mess. Residents are looking at costs of thousands of euro to fix the apartments in which they live. The stress this imposes on their day-to-day lives is immeasurable. I would suggest that we need a better response from the Department, and I ask the Minister of State to impress on Deputy Eoghan Murphy the need for a better response and for him to get off the fence and stand in the residents' corner. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As the Taoiseach hands Donald Trump a bowl of shamrock today to mark St. Patrick's Day, we must remember that the Irish in America are immigrants. We have a history of emigration. Many people left this land on coffin ships or because of sectarian strife, unemployment or poverty. There are Irish people all over the world, including, of course, in America. On St. Patrick's Day, we should remember immigrants everywhere. In that regard, we should remind Irish Americans in particular that the Irish went through exactly the same situation that immigrants in America are going through today. They suffered the same type of discrimination and religious bias. In effect, immigrants today travel on the same coffin ships. When the Irish went to America, people tried to put up walls against them. It is hypocritical for any Irish American - Republican or Democrat - to wear the green on St. Patrick's Day and also support Donald Trump and his xenophobic, racist policies. There will be a gathering at the Famine memorial at 3 o'clock on St. Patrick's Day to pay tribute to immigrants everywhere and to restate our historical and moral responsibility, as Irish people standing between what I would call the racist lie of Brexit and the racist liar, Trump, to stand for something more profound and decent than what is happening in the UK and the USA at this time. I encourage as many people as possible to attend and take an Irish stand against racism. On what has been stated about today's decision in regard to Bloody Sunday, it is a very emotional day for everybody in this country. Obviously, it is extremely emotional for the people of Derry. It should send a reminder to those in Britain and the British Parliament as to why the issue of Brexit and the Border is so important. The hands of various British Governments are all over what happened in this land for many generations. They were big players in the hurt, pain, violence, murder and bloodshed. The current British Parliament needs to understand that it is part of repairing that. Any British politician who accuses anybody over here of playing games or using the Border as a tool does not understand the hurt, pain, loss and suffering that has taken place in this land over the past 40 or 50 years. I ask MPs on any side of the House of Commons to use this day, as the people in Derry reflect, to reflect on what happened in this land over those 40 or 50 years and to understand why Brexit is such an important issue here and that the return of a hard border is unconscionable to all those who call themselves Irish. They should reflect on the people of Derry. It is important to be calm and compassionate regarding today's decision to charge one individual. However, we must remind those in Britain that this is not a game; it is life and death. It is much more important than the games that are being played in the House of Commons at the moment.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I very much appreciate the Minister being here to take this debate. I hope we can find a successful resolution to the issue at Burrow national school in Sutton, which I visited some weeks ago in order to talk to the principal and members of staff.However, the children are still learning in 20-year-old prefab buildings. In fact, one of the teachers, who is a teacher there now, is a past pupil of Burrow national school and remembers her own primary education taking place there. I want to raise the prefab replacement scheme, which was in place in 2011 and 2012. I seem to remember that the Department of Education and Skills invested in a scheme to achieve two aims, namely, to re-employ people in the construction sector who had fallen foul of the crash and to move children out of prefabricated buildings and ensure that as many as possible of the country's classrooms were permanent structures. Every child deserves to be in a permanent classroom. I am sure the Minister agrees with that. We do not want to see 20-year-old prefabs in any national school in the country. Can we work together to ensure that the children of Burrow national school have permanent classrooms and that these prefabricated buildings are done away with, so those children and the school's future pupils can look forward to a better future? It is a fantastic school that is doing a huge amount, but the children deserve more than the 20-year-old prefabricated structures in which they are learning. I would appreciate a positive response from the Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his positive reply. I will make contact with the school and forward that information to it. I appreciate him dealing with the matter in the way that he has and I hope that as a result of his response and the school making such an application we can have a resolution to the accommodation issue at Burrow national school in due course.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will briefly raise two issues. I met a group of parents in north Dublin this morning regarding class places for children with special needs, in particular, autism. This is something that this House could do some work on. It is a topic I raise frequently. The issue partly is that it falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, and children and parents are falling between those two stools. Perhaps the Leader could facilitate a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss the availability of places for children and the entire process that parents go through. Once they get a diagnosis at an early age, they are given a list of schools to apply to and it is pot luck as to whether they get a place. In a spirit of co-operation and bipartisanship, we could facilitate that discussion and talk about not only the immediacy of the issue for these particular parents but how the system could be enhanced and improved. There are lengthy waiting lists as well for early intervention for children across north Dublin and I am sure that is replicated throughout the country. While we have made advances in this area, there is much more to do. I would appreciate the opportunity to have that debate. I would also appreciate the opportunity to have a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, although this important issue is up for discussion at an Oireachtas joint committee meeting in two weeks. The House should have a say on how the public money is being spent by the FAI. I am fast coming to the conclusion that a change will only happen if the Government decides to withhold funding from the association. That would be the nuclear option but when one thinks of how important this game is for many people in Ireland, and when one thinks of disadvantaged communities that love this game, the power of the game and how poorly it is being run, the question marks over the financial arrangements within the FAI, and the fact that the former CEO can be given a new position within the organisation, significant corporate governance issues need to be addressed. I am not sure whether the Oireachtas joint committee can get to the bottom of everything because there are many matters on its plate. If we were to have a discussion in this Chamber with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I would suggest that perhaps it is time for the State to do what it can possibly most powerfully do and threaten to withhold funding from the FAI on the basis that it does not justify the funding that it gets. If they were to get their house in order and put a new regime in place to put children and players at the centre of what they do for the betterment of the game in Ireland, they would justify their funding and, in fact, they would justify much more funding in future. I ask for that debate as well.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for being here in person to discuss this matter with me. It is greatly appreciated. I rise to speak on behalf of four boys from Dublin's north side whose parents do not have a school place for them in September with the only reason being that these children have autism. I refer the Minister to the report launched today from AsIAm entitled Invisible Children - Survey on School Absence and Withdrawal in Ireland's Autism Community. I believe some representatives from the organisation are in the Public Gallery. Some of the report's findings are quite stark and some of the representations made today were quite upsetting. It is a survey involving around 300 parents. The findings showed that 35% said that they had applied to anywhere between four and seven different schools while seeking a place for their child. A total of 54% of these parents felt that our lack of school places was the largest barrier for their child in accessing education, supported by a further 18% who said that the chief obstacle was a lack of nearby schools or classes in the local catchment areas. When someone's child gets a diagnosis, what effectively happens is that he or she is handed a sheet of paper with a list of schools on it and told to do his or her best. Some of the schools I spoke to parents about were in places as far away as Drogheda. I will read into the record the names of the four children with whom I am dealing with currently. They are Oliver Lynam, Mason Kelly, James Field, whose mother Alison spoke at the launch today, and Riley O'Keefe. They have no place to go in September with the only reason being that they have autism. The manner in which we deal with these parents really needs to be investigated and improved. We are giving a list of schools to a parent and telling him or her do his or her best. While some schools will say "Yes", in this case most of them said "No". I know we have the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which would challenge some of the attitudes displayed or responses given by some of the schools and I want to get the Minister's response to that.  The fall-back position, which the parents do not want because they want their children to go to a school setting, mix with other children and have that engagement, is the potential to home school the children but, again, parents are told to find a home school tutor themselves. Unless we are professionals in the field, none of us is qualified to know what kind of home tutor will benefit our child.  Again, I talk to other parents who are on a very long waiting list to get assessments. Today I spoke to another parent, Mark, about his daughter, Abigail, and how they have tried to get early intervention and have waited for effectively two and a half years to get it.  The Minister knows that once a parent gets a diagnosis, it is as if he or she must start waging a war with a system that should care for and be compassionate to him or her. The parent faces a challenge with this diagnosis and a child he or she loves, cares for and wants to do his or her best for. Simultaneously, the parent automatically becomes a kind of political campaigner, which is not the way it should be.  On behalf of those four children about whom I spoke, can the Minister give me and the parents some assurance that these children will have a school place in September? We need a long-term conversation about how we deal with parents in this situation. It probably falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, which is probably part of the difficulty but certainly the shocking experience these parents are going through has really come to light in the past number of months. It is now April and will be May before too long. These four children do not have a school place for September.I am sure there are hundreds of other parents in the same situation, as has been outlined by the report issued today and as has been reported in The Irish Times as recently as yesterday. I would appreciate the Minister's response.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I deeply appreciate the Minister's sentiments. I have a number of issues with the Minister's response, one being that the school can apply to the Department.What happens if a school is not necessarily minded to apply? Sometimes it is easier to say "No". The fact the Department has no role in seeking a suitable school place for individual children will be of little comfort to the parents with whom I am dealing. We can see the difficulty. The NCSE is acting against schools, school patrons, parents, NEPS and health professionals. So many agencies are involved and parents go from one to the other to try to get a place for their children. I appreciate that the Minister acknowledges there are gaps, that it is not good enough and that working together we can find solutions. I appreciate that his official reply states a clearer picture will emerge in the coming weeks. This is fair enough. If we can discuss it again in a number of weeks' time we will have a clearer picture of where these four children are at and what the NCSE has come up with. Certainly, the entire system needs to change to be an awful lot more sympathetic and to rally around these parents who receive a diagnosis. Let us keep in contact and keep the conversation going. What these parents are going through is not good enough and the Minister appreciates this. He has also acknowledged that there are gaps, so let us work together to fill them and ensure the rights of the children I have named, Oliver, Mason, James and Riley, are vindicated and that they have a school place in September.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They are con artists.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I think we have collectively dismissed the idea of using a single-use plastic bag for our money. A biscuit tin is a far better idea than a plastic bag. I am keen to put that on the record in terms of climate action.I support Senator Gavan in what he said about CE supervisors.  If it has not already been seconded, I second the proposal that we do not take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill 2018 today. It is not necessary to ram through the legislation this evening. It is not fair, not right and not good parliamentary procedure, as the legislation needs to be teased out over a prolonged period.  When we talk about politics in this House, football may not be regarded as very important, but it does touch the lives of many people. I have just come from a briefing I hosted with Niall Quinn and others from the football family. One of the statistics that jumped out at me was that 30% of players in the League of Ireland had no qualifications beyond the junior certificate. That brought home to me why football was perhaps not powerful politically because the people who played the game were not powerful politically. They do not have a high level of education, as shown by the statistic I have given, and do not have many friends in the Houses. Other sports are more powerful politically as seen, for example, in the guaranteed and ring-fenced €55 million a year for the horse and greyhound sector. I think it received €89 million last year. While we argue over Sport Ireland's withdrawal of €2.7 million, it is nothing when compared with the millions and billions funnelled through Departments and these Houses. Once the circus moves on from the controversy over the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, its board and its former chief executive officer who is in the spotlight, politically we need to mind this sport because it is not being minded by those who are entrusted with the task of minding it. It needs many more political friends. Those who play the game generally come from disadvantaged communities and are more vulnerable; they are people whom politics does not necessarily reach or touch or represent, as well as others. While today's news about the board is welcome, we need to take a new direction to have a fresh start for a sport that is so important to so many in this country.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate. It relates to the Killester-Raheny-Clontarf Educate Together school, which has been given sanction for opening in September of this year after a long campaign. In fact, it is a year since I held a public meeting in Clontarf trying to get a campaign going. As a result of the patronage competition, shall we call it, Educate Together came out on top and an announcement was made that the school would open in September of this year. Many parents are delighted to hear that. However, I am slightly perturbed by the news that it will be a one-stream school as opposed to a two-stream Educate Together school, which is also sanctioned for Dublin 13 in Howth. In that period of time around and after the campaign, parents have been asking where the school will be located. The catchment area for the school is quite defined. It borders the Malahide Road, the Clontarf Road, the Tonlegee Road and the Kilbarrack Road. We were assuming that the school would be housed within that section, but what has actually happened is that two solutions have been found in the one area. Both new Educate Together primary schools are going to be housed together in the Suttonians Rugby Football Club, outside the catchment area. This smacks to me of a lazy decision by the Department. It is understandable to find one solution for the Dublin 13 Educate Together, and put it in Suttonians temporarily, but to lump the other Educate Together in there, outside of its catchment area, does not make any sense at all to me. What has happened now is that the momentum behind the school has been undermined. Parents who live in Clontarf, Raheny or Killester, who were intending to send their children to this school, do not really fancy the idea of going all the way out to Sutton and back, and have since withdrawn their children's' names from the enrolment in the school. I would like to give some background on this. There have been numerous attempts to establish a multidenominational school in the Clontarf area and the communities around Clontarf going back probably 30 years, and they have all been unsuccessful. Schools have ended up in Glasnevin, Marino or North Bay in Kilbarrack. There has never been a successful campaign until this one, and now we find that the very location of the school is going to be outside the catchment area. The Department needs to re-engage with the process to find a temporary location within the catchment area, which should not be that difficult. It has made a lazy decision in order to locate the school in Suttonians Rugby Football Club, alongside the other Educate Together school. The starting up of a school and the ethos and momentum that surrounds it is so important in the early days, and now we find a number of parents who are very disappointed. First, it is a one-stream school, so it is difficult to get into in the first place.Second, if a child is offered a place, he or she will, as we have discovered, have to travel all the way to Sutton and back. A return trip from Clontarf to Sutton is about 14 km. It is not reasonable for parents to drive infants to Sutton and back just so they can access multidenominational education. I ask the Minister of State to engage with his Department to reconsider the final decision to use Suttonians Rugby Football Club as the temporary location of Killester-Raheny-Clontarf Educate Together school, re-engage in the process to find a temporary location within the catchment area and ensure this school gets off to the best possible start.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«This is probably one of the most disappointing responses I have received. I have raised a number of issues concerning education with Ministers and I generally have reasonable interaction but this is probably the most disappointing response. I have a two-page answer, of which only the following sentence sheds any light on the issue: "Numerous locations in the school planning area were considered in regard to the interim accommodation for the school but could not be secured due to the lack of suitability or availability, or prohibitive zoning issues.” Is the Minister of State saying the residents who have engaged in this process, campaigned and pre-enrolled their children are stuck with Sutton for the coming years? Is that how it is to be? Is this the end of the matter? Can the matter be reopened? I am not overly enthusiastic about the response I got. I want to know whether the Minister of State can impress on the Minister and the Department that they are completely undermining the validity of this entire project by insisting on parents taking a 14 km round trip to Sutton and back. Sutton is outside the catchment area of the school. I do not accept that the Department has gone out of its way to find suitable accommodation but could not do so due to the lack of suitability or availability, or prohibitive zoning issues. It seems it found one answer for Dublin 13 and made the same decision for Killester-Raheny-Clontarf. This is a lazy decision which needs to be revisited. I would expect a much better response from a Department if it were genuinely taking this matter seriously.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«One cuts a ribbon, I suppose.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A journalist, Ms Sarah Jane Murphy, has highlighted the issue of anti-social behaviour on the DART. This matter has been raised on numerous occasions in the House. The Labour Party has made a practical suggestion in respect of it and our spokesperson, Senator Humphreys, has been quite vocal about the need for a dedicated transport police or a division of An Garda Síochána to be used to help protect commuters who use the DART. There is a fear that this much needed transport system will be undermined by reports of anti-social behaviour. I often hear about anti social behaviour at the stations in Bayside, Clongriffin and Howth Junction, which are all in my part of the world. The removal of staff from the stations, ticket machines being broken and glass panelling being cracked are just some of the issues that have arisen. I would appreciate a debate on that issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. When those in Fianna Fáil use words such as "scandal" and "underhand", as was the case following the announcement of the broadband scheme yesterday, it is really the worst of politics. I want to quote into the record of the House the comments of the economist, David McWilliams, who tweeted, "One bidder, astronomical cost, [Department of Finance] against it, yet State forks out €3 billion weeks before an election and will give asset back to consortium who [paid] to build it. This is children's hospital territory. Fianna Fáil gotta to [sic] pull the plug!". If Fianna Fáil was in government and acting in this way, Fine Gael would be the first party to cry foul. Just before an election, an announcement has been made regarding a contract relating to rural Ireland and worth €3 billion.Fine Gael may not, for ideological reasons, realise that the real killer for people is that €3 billion of State funding is going into an entity which will then be handed over in its entirety to a private operator. If Fine Gael had the guts, it would not have stood over a situation where the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, was organising and attending dinners with Mr. David McCourt, together with the former Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. The Minister of State got away with that scot free. Any other Minister of State involved in such a scenario would have resigned on the day it was discovered. Fianna Fáil let it go because it is more interested in retaining its arrangement with the Government until it has improved its poll ratings. For that party's Members to stand up now and talk about scandal and underhandedness is way out of line.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to the Chamber. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which we first proposed a year ago, and I am delighted the Labour Party group has facilitated its Second Stage. It is a free education Bill. What is there to oppose about that? Many Senators would not necessarily understand the importance of free education. For some people in society and in these Houses, education is something that can be bought but it should not be that way. Our Constitution specifically states primary education is free as a constitutional right but we have not vindicated that right. We in the Labour Party have outlined a number of initiatives about how that right should be vindicated. We have proposed a free book scheme, where children in the Republic of Ireland would be able to avail of schoolbooks just as children in Northern Ireland avail of them for free. Remarkably, we are the ones who are supposed to live in a Republic, as opposed to the children in Northern Ireland, but we do not have free education. The point of the Bill is to remind all of us that the relationship between a parent or child and the school the child attends should not be financial. It should be one of growth, beauty, education and learning, which should be all one speaks about in the corridors of a school with a parent, student or child. Far too often, however, the letters that are sent home from a school to a parent via a student request a voluntary contribution. If the parent is not in a position to provide the so-called voluntary contribution, the interaction between that parent and the school will become financial, while the likelihood that he or she will engage in school activities will be inhibited. If one feels one does not have the money to give a voluntary contribution, is one less or more likely to attend the parent-teacher meeting, where one will be reminded of that fact? Is one less or more likely to attend a football match or a school concert, or to engage at the school gate with a teacher or a principal who will tell the parents, "By the way, I hope you saw that note we sent home about the voluntary contribution." In a fully functioning democracy that values education, we would not have voluntary contributions. There are many countries in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia, which consider it unbelievable there would be a fundraiser for a school. Is that not what taxes are for? Many will say that without voluntary contributions, the lights cannot be kept on, the school cannot be heated and school activities cannot function properly. Is that not the conversation we should have, namely, about the proper State funding of our school system? Some say the Bill will cost €45 million. Let us find the €45 million, in that case. Let us not speak in terms of tax cuts but rather about proper provision of education for children. As many people may know, I used to teach and was principal of a school in a disadvantaged part of this city. We were not in the position to ask anybody for a voluntary contribution, nor to ask anybody for a contribution at all. We were not in the position to hold fundraisers that would raise between €40,000 and €50,000, as happens in other parts of the city, because the parents did not have the money. Is that the kind of education system we want to stand over, where those who can provide more receive more, where their children receive more, where their schools receive more, while those who cannot provide the same do not receive the same? Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, does not plug the gap. The Bill is not trying to prevent fundraisers. They will still be able to be held, with the morale-boosting cake sale and the table quiz, where funds can be raised for general school activities if the school so wishes. A contribution, however, will not be able to be linked to a school activity. The school will not be able to say that if parents do not give money, their children cannot participate, have a locker, take part in a school trip, or avail of whatever resources should be available to every child. We have tried, as have many Governments, to work with school patrons and boards of management to lessen the practice of sending voluntary contribution letters, but it is not working. We have to ban them, therefore, by bringing in legislation that bans the linkage of contributions to school activities. I return to the conversations that parents and students will have about their relationship with the school. How humiliating is it for a child if a teacher or principal surreptitiously identifies him or her in a class and gives the child a little note for his or her mammy? The child will know, as will the parent, that the reason the note has been given to him or her is that the parent has not had the capability to give the voluntary contribution, which can be anything in the region of €85, €150 or €200. The school will say that without the voluntary contribution, the school cannot be kept alive. That is the conversation the school needs to have with the State and the Department of Education and Skills, which need to be real about the day-to-day running of schools. The Department does not want to have that conversation, however, and it would prefer if it was not its responsibility at all. It would prefer the school managers to run the schools and the boards of management to do what they will, while the Department merely provides the curriculum and pays the teachers. I do not agree with that. We need a State education system which we need the Department to take seriously and fund. That is why we pay our taxes. That is what a fair, transparent and progressive taxation system is all about, and schools should not ask for parents to foot the bill a second time. Fundamentally, what we are trying to achieve is not to stop fundraising or contributions if somebody wants to contribute to a school. Rather, it is intended to stop the practice of linking financial contributions to school activities and of so-called voluntary contributions because they are not voluntary.What does the aspiration or vision of free education mean? Free education means one does not have to pay for one's books. Free education means one does not have to pay for the school trip. Free education means one is not asked repeatedly for money for arts supplies. Free education means one does not have to pay for the school meal. Free education means one does not have to pay for school transport. This stuff has to be paid for but this is the choice that we have to make in Irish society. Do we believe in a tax cutting regime which individualises everything, which benefits the rich more and which entrenches inequality or do we believe in the provision of public services for everybody? Please do not tell me about the schemes we have in disadvantaged schools, etc. More than one disadvantaged child will be found in every single school in this land as will overlapping, entrenched, intergenerational disadvantage and these are still the children who get the letter home asking for a so called voluntary contribution. It is humiliating, it is undermining, it is embarrassing and it is completely unnecessary in one of the richest countries in Europe. I appreciate the Government is not opposing the Bill. What we can achieve this evening is that we stand fast to that republican ideal of free education. It is not something I just came up with, it is entrenched in the Constitution of the land. Let us vindicate that right, let us make education free and let us break this chain that drags down so many parents at the school gate, that they will not go past it because they do not have the money. It is not because there is a fee involved in sending one's child to a school in the vast majority of cases. They will not pass the school gate because somebody will ask them an awkward question about the voluntary contribution and the few quid. They will ask parents what is €85 when they are providing education but education is the great leveller and the great liberator. It is the one thing that frees more people from poverty than anything else, not because it turns people into economic units so they can compete in the job market but because it frees the mind. It opens people up to beauty, to poetry and to language and to know the value of love and interpersonal relationships. Education is everything and a price tag cannot be put on it but in far too many circumstances, there are far too many families who have an envelope in September that they cannot fill. Let us take away that conversation. Let us make the conversations at the school gate about education and about beauty, language, poetry, aspiration and the matters that make the hair stand on the back of the neck. Let us not make it about an envelope and a contribution. Let us make it purely and simply about education.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Sometimes in this House we introduce legislation and are not sure how far it will go, what it will inspire, whether it will be viewed in a particular way or become a political football, or whether we are all just playing games here. Notwithstanding the contributions of Senators Byrne and Horkan, I find myself humbled to be in a room having listened to what Senators Gavan and Ruane had to say about this legislation. Perhaps it will not get very far and maybe the Government will not accord to it the respect it deserves. Perhaps it will fall on the next Stage, maybe it will be amended to death, or maybe the House will fall before it gets any further but, that said, it was worth listening to what Senator Gavan said about moving from the United Kingdom to Ireland, the necessity of buying books and the ideological reality of the choices voters can make. Having heard Senator Gavan, I am reflecting on the question of what in God's name the Senator and I are doing in different political parties. This Bill is about the power of the State to deliver equality. The market cannot be trusted to deliver equality because it has no conscience. One cannot depend on the private pocket to deliver what are fundamental State services that will lift people out of poverty. I listened to Senator Ruane outline her real-life experience and to her powerful words.Her note of caution to Senators speaks to the real, lived experience of those we are trying to serve. Schools are not about boards of management. As a former teacher and school principal, I venture to suggest that schools are in fact not even about teachers. The best advice I got when I became a school principal was to put the child at the centre of every decision I made. I took that to the extreme and at the end of the school day I used to sit in their seats to see what they saw, how far they were from the blackboards we had in those days and from the windows and toilets. It was to see how cramped they were. One began to realise that the complaints children sometimes had in class were real. They do not just complain for the sake of it, these are real experiences for them. One does not know what the experience of a child is if one is a teacher sitting at a teacher's desk. As Senator Ruane stated, the board of management runs the school but the whole point of the education exercise is to inspire people in kitchens and sitting rooms across the land to feel that schools are on their side completely. People should feel that the school and the teacher support them every step of the way and that schools, teachers and principals are singing from the same hymn sheet completely to inspire, drive and help children to grow in a way that, perhaps, their parents did not get a chance to. There is then an envelope and a request for a voluntary contribution because something must be paid for and the books must balance. We all live in the real world. I know we have to heat schools. They must be lit and they must function. However, that is a broader question for the State. There should be no humiliation and any possible circumstance of humiliation a child might feel must be eliminated. Humiliation is not something that happens on the day a child goes to school and has to say his or her mother, father or grandparent will give the money when they can. It sticks with one for life. It is not a temporary thing. It does not stick with one for a day or a week. One remembers for the rest of one's life how one felt when one did not have the money and that gets passed to the next generation. If it has achieved anything, the Bill has at least allowed us to trade comments and experiences and to discuss the beauty of education and the need to ensure that it is there for everyone and does not come with a price tag. If there is any barrier whatsoever to someone's engagement with a school community, it must be removed. If it costs €45 million to deliver free education or €100 million to deliver the school books scheme, that is a small price to pay. In the context of other conversations we are having on broadband and the children's hospital, €100 million is nothing. What a small price to pay when the cost of not doing it is so great. The cost in humiliation and shame is intergenerational and lasts a lifetime. I appreciate that the Government is not opposing the Bill. I appreciate that Governments and civil servants must make arguments about why things cannot, should not or may not be able to be done. I get all that, but we have opened a conversation for all of us within our various political parties to reassess the value of education, school life, vision, beauty, love, poetry and all the things we say we believe in. When it comes to election time, we can prioritise the public good, public need and public service above the private tax cut. That is what the children and families of Ireland need. There is no price we should consider too costly if it is to eliminate the possibility of any child or parent feeling humiliation.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next Tuesday.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join others who have raised the issue of the availability of Spinraza and welcome the decision made by NHS England, the chief executive of which, Mr. Simon Stevens, said: "This promising treatment has the potential to be life changing for children and their families." Obviously, he is referring to children who suffer from SMA. I have received messages from families who believe they are being managed in the run-up to the local and European elections on 24 May, given the absence of the announcement on this matter that was due to take place this week. As stated, Ireland and Estonia are the only two EU countries that do not fund this treatment. As other Senators stated, we need to have an honest debate about the matter. I know that such situations are not easy to deal with, that the Government has to strike a deal and that the process can be difficult, but the lives the children are leading are extremely difficult, much more difficult than anybody can possibly imagine. Therefore, a debate on the availability of Spinraza would be greatly appreciated. I understand there will be another protest next week on 22 May calling on the Government to fund the provision of Spinraza. I refer to a shooting in Donaghmede yesterday. Unfortunately, a shooting outside a shopping centre at 5.20 p.m. or early in the evening does not seem to receive much media attention anymore. That is a shocking indictment of our society. Shots were fired outside Donaghmede Shopping Centre at 5.20 p.m. yesterday. The Government is almost disinterested in crime levels in that part of the city. Whenever we raise the issue in this House, as I have done on countless occasions, I am told that the provision of Garda resources and the potential construction of a new Garda station in the hugely expanding area of Donaghmede, Clongriffin and Belmayne are not matters for decision by the Minister but by the Garda Commissioner, yet when the assistant Garda Commissioner said there was absolutely no justification for the reopening of Stepaside Garda station, Cabinet Ministers were able to make it their business to open it. Why is Stepaside more important than an area on the northside when it comes to the provision of Garda resources? Shots being fired at 5.20 p.m. outside of a shopping centre in Donaghmede is not normal. Shootings do not happen in a normal society and they cannot be treated as normal. It is not a case of business as usual because anybody could be caught in the crossfire. With the greatest of respect, I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a discussion in this House with the Minister for Justice and Equality on crime in the capital city.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I echo the comments of Senator Ruane regarding the debate on the decriminalisation of drug use. Notwithstanding the emotion Senator Lawless has about those who died at the roadside in Ireland 150 years ago - and while I agree with his sentiments - there are people dying at the roadside throughout Ireland and in its capital city every day as a result of drug overdoses. We seem to have a romantic view of what happened 150 years ago yet we have a victim-blaming attitude to those who die in toilets, parks, stairwells of flat complexes and alleyways as a result of overdoses. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe. The discussion on decriminalisation, which is at a sensitive point, purely aims to help somebody who has an addiction, not through the criminal justice system but through the health system. It is just as radical as that. There was a disgraceful letter in The Irish Times yesterday from 20 or more GPs who feel it falls upon them to derail the humanity of what we are trying to achieve. To suggest that the move towards decriminalisation is a Trojan horse for anything but keeping people alive is outrageous. As Senator Ruane indicated, it is beyond time for the debate on this matter to take place. We are willing to work with the Government on the basis of the report, which may or may not already have been heavily leaked, if what comes out of it provides a basis upon which we can work. To suggest that the decriminalisation argument is somehow trying to achieve something else is absolutely insulting to all of us who do not believe that people who are sick or who have addictions belong before the courts; they do not. Someone who is sick, who is in need of medical help and who has an addiction does not belong in a courtroom, a prison or a Garda cell. They should not be interacting with the criminal justice system. Such a person needs a counsellor, a nurse, a doctor and a path to recovery. That is the basis for decriminalisation. It is not decriminalisation of the substances but of the person. If this issue was taken seriously, we would have a lot fewer people dying on our streets as a result of what is a real and contemporaneous issue.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The full facts have yet to come out. This is unbelievable.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In a similar vein to Senator Ruane, I thank the Minister of State, her officials and Mr. King for their engagement. This has been a positive process and on that basis I support what the Minister of State said. I hope we have contributed in our own way to make this a stronger Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister being here in person to discuss this. I have raised issues of crime, criminality and anti-social behaviour in Dublin’s north side for at least a year. The responses from the Minister and his office have been disappointing. There has been a shooting, a pipe bomb incident, and a shooting incident outside Donaghmede Shopping Centre. There is currently great media interest and focus on the area because of three murders in the past week. What will the Government’s response to this be? To be fair to the Government, when a similar situation arose in the north inner city, there was a very high-level response from the Government. There were high-level meetings with stakeholders in St. Lawrence O’Toole school then, and a very hands-on approach, including the commission of the Mulvey report, which is still being implemented. The discussions were not merely on a policing response but also took place with various agencies involved in youth empowerment and there were anti-poverty measures. What is the Government’s response to this situation? Will the Minister and the Government engage a Mulvey-style report for Dublin 17 and the wider area? Is the Minister aware that a neighbouring community is due to expand its population to 50,000 and that community is campaigning for a Garda station as part of its infrastructure? Will the Minister sit down with Sphere 17 youth services and the Preparing for Life group in Darndale which are making fantastic inroads into parental empowerment in that area, with great success? There are other agencies such as RASP drugs services, Doras Buí, and Northside Partnership, all of which have things to say. I spoke to two school principals in recent days. They are worried about the long-term impact this will have on children in the immediate area if this becomes normalised. They walk past Garda tape and dead bodies, or they hear gunshots. This is not normal and it cannot be seen to be normal. We have a responsibility to the future of these children that they feel that the hand of the State is lifting them up, so that when something like this happens, the State will intervene and shoulder their cares and there is political and governmental leadership. Will the Government please recognise that there is a problem in this area of the city which is spiralling out of control, and that it is the responsibility of the Taoiseach and the Government to show the leadership and be in these communities, talking to the people who care passionately about those communities, because we are losing the battle? Why is it that young men are only too willing to take the place of those who have just been murdered? We must change our drug policy and the policing policy on that side of the city. We need the resources but we must also talk about youth empowerment. I ask the Minister, the Taoiseach, and all others who have influence in this area to commission a Mulvey-style report for Dublin 17 and wider communities so that investment can start flowing, policing can be enhanced, and we do not see a return to the type of bloodshed we have seen over the past week.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for his response. Will he commit to extra Garda resources for this area and to a commission along the lines I have suggested and similar to what took place in the north inner city? The Minister touched on it in his reply but did not go as far as it. I suggest a Mulvey-style report which will deal with all the agencies which the Minister outlined. He has suggested that the Commission on the Future of Policing is the answer.I am suggesting something different. The Government is already engaged in such a process in Dublin's north inner city. I am asking the Minister to initiate that process in the Dublin 17 and wider areas. Is the Minister making more Garda resources available to this area? Along with other Ministers will he lead the process to commission a report into the need for resources and a long-term response to what has happened in the Dublin 17 area? I ask the Minister to commit to those two things on behalf of those who are suffering and feel not just uneasy but scared living in those communities.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for attending to discuss this important issue. Priory Hall has been mentioned and I will not go over it again, but a man lost his life due to the stress involved in that situation. What we are discussing is not a victimless crime - no one is suggesting that it is - and it has a major impact on people's day-to-day lives. The home where they reside should be somewhere they seek sanctuary and where they come home to at the end of the day. It should not be something that gives them a headache. They should not wake up in the morning, look around and feel depressed about the lives they are living. There are other pressures in people's lives - work, family, things that go wrong, finances, etc. The house that one lives in should not cause one distress. In many ways, I am reluctant to name the areas where I have been working, given that the values of such properties inevitably decrease. Sometimes, the challenge that we in politics face is how to advocate for people who are caught in a situation without doing irreparable damage to the value of their properties. We are always trying to find a balance. Sometimes, that lets developers off with what they have done. However, the issues in Belmayne are in the public domain. I have met families, sat in their accommodations and witnessed their frustration, angst and terror about raising families in apartments that are in their view and according to the advice they have received fire hazards. Unfortunately, they feel like they are acting alone, do not have backup from the State and are fighting a lonely battle. They bought something in good faith at a time when it was extremely expensive to do so, yet all of those agencies that should be encircling them and fighting and advocating for them do not appear to be in attendance now - the Dublin city fire officer, Dublin City Council, the Minister's office and the developer. One would imagine that there would be a sense of urgency to surround these families with care, compassion, understanding and, indeed, finance. If families are being quoted a price to refurbish a particular unit, and given that it was no fault of their own that they bought a fire trap, surely a mechanism or fund should be in place for them to access and dip into in order to facilitate those changes and modifications. Being caught in this situation is distressing for families. When an area is identified as potentially having fire risks, please do not let any of us be present at the site of a disaster the morning after saying that, although we had been told, we had not been sure and there had been a court case or other reasons for us not to intervene. Will the Minister engage proactively, particularly in the Belmayne situation, with the city council, the fire officer and residents on finding a solution to allow these families to move on with their lives? It seems like a pause is being placed on their lives until the situation is adequately resolved. It is difficult to envisage how someone can put his or her child to bed at night in a place he or she does not believe is safe. Will the Minister please take it upon himself to be the person to back these families, get everyone around the table, including the developer, Dublin City Council, the council's fire officer, the residents' groups, public representatives and whoever else needs to be there, and find a way to make this situation better? It may require a fund that can be accessed interest free or a grant to alleviate the issues. The question of why the taxpayer should foot the bill for developers' wrongdoings has been mentioned. I have sympathy with that argument, but people who, in good faith, bought an apartment that now potentially threatens their lives and the lives of their children should not foot the bill either. There must be a middle way. I appeal to the Minister's better instincts and ask him for his proactive engagement in the Belmayne area. I want to be able to report to the residents this evening that the Minister listened, cares, wants to find solutions and will engage with the community directly.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the debate on Committee Stage of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 conclude at 6 p.m.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«To be adjourned. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Government are to be commended for their action in respect of the availability of Spinraza, on which we have made many contributions in this House. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has now announced that it will fund it. The decision made by the United Kingdom in recent weeks to change its position was welcome and probably led to the decision made here this week. I think, in particular, of Sam Bailey and his family who have been campaigning with others throughout the country to reach this day. I commend the Government for what it has done. It is a life-changing moment for many children. I congratulate, in particular, the Minister for Health and his officials on doing the right thing.  It has been announced that Philomena Lynott has passed away at the age of 88 years. She was the mother of Phil Lynnott and worked so hard to keep his legacy alive. Her love for him is a great Irish story. I offer my condolences and those of the Labour Party to her family and those who loved Philomena and Phil.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support the INTO's call for an increase in the capitation grant for primary schools to pre-2011 levels. We need to constantly remind ourselves of the constitutional right to free primary education which has not been vindicated over the years of this State. The Labour Party has published Bills to abolish the practice of voluntary contributions. We have been told by certain school managers that filling the gap would cost the State €45 million. The reason the capitation payment needs to be increased is that parents are filling that gap through fund-raising. Progressive minded people in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries, find it mind-boggling that a parents' group would have to fund-raise for the basic provision of school or educational activities, particularly in primary school. We have also suggested that we should have a free book scheme in the Republic of Ireland, as they have in the North of Ireland. I ask the Leader to facilitate a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills on how we can access funding to vindicate the right to free primary school education; ensure parents do not have to fund-raise; raise the capitation to such a level that schools can be properly funded; and ensure we have services in the Republic that are taken as a right and taken for granted in the North of Ireland. We have an education budget of approximately €11 billion. If a free primary school book scheme would cost €20 million, and that the shortfall in funding through voluntary contributions to the capitation funding would cost €45 million, it would surely be worth providing the total amount required to vindicate that right. This would ensure that the parental and student relationship with a school is not a financial one but is one based purely on education, growth and development. The Government will find great support from across this Chamber if we were to have such a conversation and vindicate that constitutional right. That is my first point. On a second issue-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support the comments made by Senator Feighan and what the Government has been saying in response to the rhetoric being used in the Tory leadership contest in Britain. There is an awful lot of buffoonery happening with talk of renegotiation at European level, which will not happen. The backstop is going absolutely nowhere. It is important for all of us was to stand firm with the Government on this to reaffirm that nothing is going to be renegotiated. Anybody with leadership aspirations in the British Tory Party needs to be reminded of that. I fear for the future of politics in Britain and that it will mirror what we have in the United States at the moment if, as is likely, Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I join others in expressing the Labour Party group's sympathy on the passing of the Cathaoirleach's sister and the Leas Cathaoirleach, Senator Paul Coghlan's mother. I join others in recognising the industrial action by SIPTU workers that will take place on Thursday. It is important that people understand that no worker takes the withdrawal of his or her labour lightly. It is the singular most difficult decision that any worker can make. It is a particularly painful decision, which can have any number of ramifications, sometimes for years, in how a person's position in work might be treated and interactions with others in work can suffer as a consequence. Taking industrial action is a major decision. The Government has reneged on its promises to these workers. Many of our hospitals will effectively shut down on Thursday. Many Oireachtas Members will stand shoulder to shoulder with members of SIPTU on Thursday, as will I. As others have noted, it is important that the Government steps in to resolve this. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to suggest that this is a matter for the Labour Court. The Government and the HSE are the employer, they have reneged on promises made and they should resolve the dispute immediately so that we do not end up with pickets outside hospitals.  Anyone who has had the misfortune of having a loved one under the care of people who work in hospitals will be aware of the essential services that go beyond the nursing and doctor grades furnished by people who provide meals or transport around the hospital. Hospitals cannot function without them. I very much give them my support and thank Senators Nash and Gavan for their presentation earlier with SIPTU workers. I have spoken previously about the issue of school places for children with autism on the north side of Dublin and I thought we were making progress on it. I raised it as a Commencement Matter and, in fairness to the Minister, he gave me great assurances that no child would be left without a school place in September. However, the issue is still unresolved. As the Leader knows, there were marches in Cork and Dublin last Saturday. Yesterday it was reported in The Irish Times that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is telling the Minister there are not sufficient school places in September for children with autism. This is not something that is just being said by a campaign group; the NCSE is also stating it. Can we please have a debate in the House with the Minister, whom I know is a fair minded man? We cannot have a situation where children with autism have no school places in September. The system is broken and needs to be fixed. It is now the middle of June and we are facing a situation where children will have no school to go to in September. I plead with the Leader to have this discussion with the Minister. I know he will do his best to find a solution but we are waiting and we still do not have a resolution to this very serious issue.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is true.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I congratulate Irish Rail on responding to recent cases of anti-social behaviour on its services by introducing a text message alert system. It is due to come into effect in the next couple of weeks to deal with anti-social behaviour on rail services. Anybody who uses the DART, in particular, knows that it is an important transport service for the citizens of Dublin and that we must defend public transport because it is important. We must ensure we can overcome the barriers that might make people reluctant to use the DART service. It is time to have a discussion with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on security in the transport system. He has spoken about being in favour, in principle, of having a transport police service or a section of An Garda Síochána being assigned to transport services. I would appreciate it if the Leader facilitated such a discussion. There is a realisation in Irish Rail that there is a problem. If the Minister also recognises there is a problem, perhaps we might work together to try to find a solution and deal with the matter in the way it has been dealt with in other jurisdictions. I commend the #SaferFromHarm campaign. Yesterday Christy Moore lent his considerable credibility to the campaign, which aims to advance the cause of decriminalising drug use and dealing with addiction simply as a medical issue rather than as a criminal justice matter. I know that the relevant Minister of State will soon have sight of a working group report and we hope to discuss its recommendations. There is a growing body of opinion which realises the place for people with addiction is not a courtroom or a Garda station, that they should be helped in the medical sphere. I would appreciate having a discussion in this House on the report with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, in order that we can advance the cause of decriminalisation of drug use. I congratulate the Ana Liffey Drug Project and others who are behind the agenda. To my mind, it is one of the more crucial campaigns of our time. As we are so close to making a difference in this space, I would really appreciate having that debate.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I pay tribute to Senator Grace O'Sullivan. She will be a Senator for the remainder of the day. We all know her as a hard-working and diligent Member of Seanad Éireann. From looking at her campaign videos I did not realise what an action woman she had been over many years in advocating for environmental justice. The European Parliament will have an excellent advocate for Ireland South, as well as for the whole country of Ireland and for the planet. We need more people like the Senator in politics and we wish her the best in her endeavours. I want to read into the record the names of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and Valeria, his 23 month old daughter. A photograph emerged of Oscar and Valeria face down in the Rio Grande in recent days, drowned in an attempt to cross the river. This is a particularly affecting photograph because it brings to light again the type of risks people are taking in order to make better lives for themselves. Oscar left Valeria on a riverbank in an attempt to go back and save his wife who was in distress. However, a current took them both and they drowned. There is a very affecting photograph which shows Valeria's 23 month old arm wrapped around her father's neck. These are people who President Trump has dismissed as animals. We have all received invitations to the American Embassy next week to drink champagne and celebrate Independence Day on 4 July. Just like last year, we are calling for an Oireachtas boycott of this event.We do not do these things lightly but when the President of America, again with his hateful rhetoric, causes such pain and division in his own country, and he is still the international face of hate, when children are denied basic sanitary provision at the Mexican border, when they are held in what have been described as concentration camps, when one has families being broken up at the border, and then when the image emerges of Oscar and his daughter, Valeria, lying face down in water, one is reminded of what Trump has said about immigrants. He has described them in many different ways but he has used the term "animals". Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us in this House to turn down the invitation. If we really believe in equality, and we will celebrate the Pride Festival this weekend, then it would be deeply hypocritical to attend the American ambassador's reception to celebrate 4 July. Therefore, I call on all Members of this House and the Oireachtas to look at the photograph and choose not to attend the ambassador's reception next week.

AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to raise the issue of the drug decriminalisation. I refer to the front page of today's edition of the Daily Record, a Scottish newspaper. It states:Scotland is gripped by the worst drug crisis in Europe. It is killing people and wrecking communities. Our investigation has shown tough justice is not the cure. We must target dealers but it's time to stop treating vulnerable citizens as criminals. Our country needs powers to treat addiction as a health problem not a crime. It is time to decriminalise drug use.The same sentiments are expressed in an open letter from Stuart Clarke of Hot Press to the Taoiseach which notes that the Taoiseach has admitted to taking illegal drugs in the past but nobody would suggest he should have a criminal record as a result. A document is due to be brought to Cabinet either this week or next week. It is the result of the deliberations of a working group on drug decriminalisation established two years ago this month. It was to report after 12 months but did not do so. Two years later, we are still waiting for the publication of its report. The decriminalisation of drugs for personal use is potentially the biggest game-changer in terms of equality in the State at this time. It touches everything from poverty, disadvantage and homelessness to crime, violence and murder. The Government, which is led by the Leader's party, has the opportunity to publish this report, take this issue seriously and to move, as have other countries in Europe, to a system in which those with an addiction are dealt with primarily and almost exclusively through the health system and treated as human beings rather than as criminals in the criminal justice system. We have spoken about this issue for a number of years. We are now at the point where the Cabinet is about to consider the working group's report. The report needs to be published and we need to move on and take seriously the issue of decriminalising the use of drugs by people who have addictions. I urge the leader to facilitate a debate in this House with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, or the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, because we have waited too long for such a debate to take place in these Houses. We also need to have that report published and acted upon.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It was a working group report on-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes, that is correct.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the acting Leader.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Every year.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State and am grateful to Members for facilitating me. I do not intend to speak for long. This comes in the overall context of what could be classed as wasted recovery.When one hears the Taoiseach, who is the actual Minister for Defence, taking every opportunity at Fine Gael events to announce his intention to cut taxes to the tune of €3 billion or so - €600 million a year over the coming years - while the best our Defence Forces can get is €10 million, it really sticks in the craw. We are proud of our Defence Forces and our military personnel. We know what they do; they protect people and save lives. We are all proud to see the work they do across the world. Having served in government with Fine Gael, it is remarkable to hear members of that party bellyaching about allowances. Those individuals completely misunderstand the nature of public service. When we went into government together, we had a five-a-side a club which included the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. He railed against things such as allowances in the public service. Fine Gael is aided and abetted by people in the media who belittle the type of arrangements in place in the public service for people who do difficult work. The idea was to get rid of all of these allowances because they make no sense. What the Minister of State has done here is a classic "Bertieism". He has gone back to the idea of allowances rather than core pay in order to fix an immediate problem. A sentence in the Minister of State's script jumped out at me, namely, "Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel." There is a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel because the pay is so poor. The suggestion is that it is down to the unique and demanding nature of military life and that if the pay was better, the issue of retention would not be as great. This is a plaster over a very serious issue in respect of which people contact us all the time. They cannot do it themselves. We have to accept that this is the reason they do not get fair play. They cannot do it themselves because they are not entitled to unionise. As a result, their partners and spouses make contact with us, often in an emotional state, and ask us to do something to restore pay and provide decent wages. Those who contact me are generally, though not always, speaking for their husbands. They want the recovery that is spoken about to be brought into their lives. The Minister of State has found a sticking plaster to cover his immediate problem. In the context of the €600 million his Government is willing to throw at those who earn higher incomes over each of the next three years, this really does stick in the craw. This attack on public service and public servants over a long period by people in the Minister of State's party, aided and abetted by people in the media, has to stop. He is using this complete misunderstanding of allowances and what they are for to get himself out of this particular hole. This issue comes down to pay, conditions, and decency and dignity at work. It is not good enough to stand shoulder to shoulder in saying how proud we are of our Defence Forces and military personnel if we are not willing to pay them. We all know the reason they do not get fair play is that they do not have the capacity to raise their own voices in trade union negotiations. I expect these measures to be accepted in the short term but it is absolutely no substitute for the restoration of pay as a proper and dignified recognition of the worth of the work of the brave men and women who wear our colours all over the world.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State and her officials for their engagement. I have met her officials to discuss certain elements of the Bill. I am glad that we have found solutions to meet some of the concerns of the Labour Party. Some of our amendments, as proposed by the Progressive College Network, were not accepted in the Dáil. There was disappointment with the stance taken by Fianna Fáil which was not in a position to support the Labour Party's amendments which, as a consequence, fell in the Dáil. In the Seanad we do not deal with amendments that have fallen, only those that have been passed. I thank all those who have worked so hard to make the Bill a success. We would like it to be better, but the Minister of State did not see fit to support our amendments in the Dáil. However, as always, we will work with her and her officials and co-operate on future legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On behalf of the Labour Party, I congratulate the Minister on the passage of this Bill. We in the Seanad and Deputy Sherlock in the Dáil are anxious to be as helpful as possible in this regard. The Minister knows, as he has reiterated it a number of times, that the lack of an administration in the North and a government in Stormont is deeply regrettable, especially at this crucial time in the history of these islands, with the disaster of Brexit unfolding every day. The Labour Party supports this Bill, and we welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner will now be able to enter into co-operation agreements with non-police or non-law enforcement bodies outside the State. We thank the Minister and his officials for the work they have done on this Bill. As ever, when dealing with matters in both Northern Ireland and these islands generally, it is most advantageous when the political systems in the two Houses of the Oireachtas work as one. I again thank the Minister and his officials. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Anybody who has an interest in politics or who has engaged in politics anywhere in the world will have found yesterday a particularly disturbing day, observing what is happening in the United States and in the United Kingdom, which we would all regard as being too great democratic institutions. On one side of the Atlantic, proceedings are being undertaken to potentially impeach a President, the charge being that he has asked a foreign power to investigate a political rival. In the United Kingdom we have the Supreme Court ruling that the Prime Minister broke the law in suspending Parliament. In those two countries it seems that politics is in a very dangerous and disturbing place, where any amount of middle ground discourse is almost impossible. Previously, there seemed to be an ability for people to find common ground in the centre of two opposites but now Brexit has become a religion. What Trump is trying to achieve in the United States has a similar type of religious zeal to it.Considering that these two great countries influence so much of what is good in democracy, I worry when I see what is happening. While we have been rightly critical of our own political system and institutions for so long, I am thankful that we seem to have been doing reasonably well recently, especially facing Brexit on 31 October. A dark turn was taken a number of weeks ago, however, when Members of these Houses were engaged in whipping up sentiment at public meetings in certain parts of the country using half-truths, mistruths and very poisonous language to try to get cheap votes, cheap rounds of applause and cheap support on the back of particularly vulnerable people. I spent time as a Minister of State under the previous Government. The reason I have changed my view on the very existence of this House was because of how everybody here at the time and since has come together with one voice to speak on the issue of direct provision. What happened in Oughterard was a disgrace on the political side. We have an opportunity in this House to stand together and show a different side of Irish politics. I encourage the Leader to facilitate this discussion and ask the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to come to the House to discuss the matter again. I acknowledge he has been here on numerous occasions to do so but it is incumbent on us to show a different side of Irish politics and the type of leadership needed rather than opting for the debased politics we see in the United Kingdom and America. The people of Oughterard have been let down terribly by the type of rhetoric used. We have chance to step into the space as a collective and show a little more leadership than was shown in that instance.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Often we stand in the Chamber and make political charges against each other. We spark off each other and this is the way of political theatre. In light of what the British Government is apparently proposing as a solution to its Brexit problem, the Houses of the Oireachtas must stand firm as a collective. It is deeply upsetting to everybody in Ireland to witness what is happening in the United Kingdom. One can only use words that Boris Johnson has used and describe the proposal as complete humbug. Twenty years ago, the British Government signed a sacred peace agreement after 30 years of violence and more than 3,000 deaths. All of us, Irish, British, Northern Irish, unionist and nationalist, said we would never again return to a scenario that would lead to violence. Less than 20 years later, the British Government has thrown that agreement in the fire and considers English nationalism to be much more important and that a small cabal in the British Tory Party had to be placated. The lack of knowledge among the British commentariat, public and political system and, particularly, the Tory party about the sensitivities of this island and what happened here is quite astonishing. Within all of this, for Boris Johnson to use words of war in his common discourse is deeply offensive. He has used phrases and words such as dying in a ditch, surrender and traitors. It is deeply offensive given what has happened in this country. On behalf of the Labour Party and, I am quite sure, other parties in the Chamber I say we stand firmly behind the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in their absolute rejection of the proposals coming from the British Government. These proposals are coming from an entity that has no interest in a deal. While we spend a huge number of hours disagreeing in this Chamber, on this day of days, as we head towards 31 October and the British Prime Minister addresses his party conference, we must call out this nonsense for what it is. It is a result of narrow-minded xenophobic English nationalism and the Oireachtas will not accept it. It will stand up for the Good Friday Agreement and peace and prosperity on this island and throughout Europe.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister will be aware of the situation on the north side of Dublin, which I have raised here constantly and consistently over the last year. It has spiralled out of control when murders, gun crime, pipe bombs, shootings outside shopping centres in daylight or murders outside primary schools are part of a list of incidents that have taken place in the Dublin 17, 13 and 5 in the past 12 months. I have consistently tried to be constructive and I have asked the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to replicate what they did in the north inner city. He has consistently refused. The Mulvey report was produced in respect of the north inner city, and a sit-down initiative was taken by the Government to get every agency, political representative and stakeholder to come up with a set of proposals that would not only police away the problem but understand the reasons for the problem. What I have been asking for, in an effort to be constructive, is for a Mulvey-style report to engage agencies such as Northside Partnership, Preparing for Life in Darndale, local schools and community groups and residents' associations to come up with the reasons such gangland crime, violence and murder are happening and come up with constructive solutions so we can police our way out of it.  Having said that, on my initiative and that of the Clongriffin community association, there has been a campaign for a new Garda station in the Dublin 13 and 17 areas. I am pleased this has been agreed to and this station will be in situ in a number of years. However, the Minister must agree that it cannot be normalised for children to grow up seeing Garda tape in their area because of another shooting. It cannot be normal for a child to go to a primary school having to step around a crime scene or a murder. In my community, which I try to represent to the best of my ability, this is happening far too often. I do not accept that if it happened in any other part of the country, it would be considered acceptable, but for some reason on the north side of Dublin, it is almost coming to be accepted that this is the way it is. However, that is not the way it is. It is a proud part of the country and the city and it deserves answers. I appeal to the Minister and Government to set aside party political divisions, conclude that there is a problem here and commission a report over a period of months, bringing together every stakeholder who cares about the area in a room to come up with a set of proposals that might educate, lift and empower the community out of the situation. Policing is part of the solution, but not alone. Once again, I plead with the Minister to replicate what he did in the north east inner city on this part of the north side as then we might get solutions and a community that feels that the State is working on its behalf. Young people are making decisions. I am sure there is a young person making a decision today regarding whether he or she goes down the route of gangland crime or involve himself or herself in the mainstream economy and society. Those decisions are made every day. It is empowering for a person to get a gun in his or her hand so we must ask how we get to a point where communities find better solutions and choices for young people. We can do that together but every time I raise this, I do not get an answer. I find that desperately disappointing when the Government found the energy to do it in one part of the city. I implore the Minister to please do the same in the Dublin 17, Dublin 13 and Dublin 5 areas.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House. Again, my party supports the Bill, in principle. We will work with the Minister and his officials in as constructive a manner as we possibly can as this Bill makes it way through the House. I have an issue with the Bill in that, as has been outlined by other speakers, the relationship many students and parents have with schools is a financial one. A disproportionate number of conversations that principals have with parents and that teachers have with parents and students are about money. If that is the basis of a conversation one has with a school because of a voluntary contribution, book money or any other moneys that are perceived to be owing, be it at primary or secondary level and notwithstanding the fact that free education is reputedly a constitutional right, this impinges on one's capacity to have a proper, full or empowering conversation about one's child and his or her development in the school. Regrettably, asking for a voluntary contribution is in the Bill. We should be working our way towards there being no voluntary contributions because the State should properly finance our school system. In other jurisdictions in the European Union and across Europe, such voluntary contributions are banned. The Labour Party has a Bill that proposes to ban voluntary contributions that will come towards the House next week.  If one's conversation as a parent is constantly a reminder, subtle or otherwise, about the necessity for a voluntary contribution or book money to be paid, is one more or less likely to find oneself at the school gates? Is one more or less likely to put oneself forward to become a member of the parents' association? Is one more or less likely to stand for a position on the board of management? Is one more or less like to attend parent-teacher meetings? I suggest, and most people will agree with me, that if money is an issue or if this transactional relationship one has with a school is disproportionately large, then one is less likely to engage and less likely to discuss one's child in terms of development and education, how to help one's child at home, how to read to one's child at home, how one can improve a child's oral language skills, improve literacy or how to engage with the system when one's child has a diagnosis about which one has concerns. Unfortunately, the conversation comes back to the book money or the voluntary contribution etc. It is far too expensive, in a society that calls itself a republic and one that has a Constitution that underpins the right to free education, to send one's child to school.We have spoken about uniforms. County Derry is close to the Minister's constituency. In the Six Counties, school books are free because a determination was made once upon a time that school books should be free and no parent of a child in the North of Ireland pays for books. It would cost the Exchequer €20 million to provide that at primary level in the Republic. I believe it is not just a financial issue; I believe the Department is horrified at the suggestion that it would engage itself in the day-to-day management of schools. That is the real reason because it wants to allow the patron bodies to maintain the power and autonomy. This Bill comes from a good place. What the Minister is trying to achieve is that parents and students feel more empowered and greater partners in the education system and in their school life. That is to be congratulated and supported. That is what we want to do. There is a wider issue about whether we tinker with the system or radically overhaul and improve it. Based on my experience as a school teacher and a principal, I was having too many conversations with parents about money. In the context of a DEIS school in an acutely disadvantaged area, even when the book rental scheme was available for all children and it was much cheaper for them to avail of school books than for any other child, having to ask for €60 impinged on my capacity to talk to that parent about other issues that I should have been talking about. Where a parents' association believes that it is fundamentally a fundraising association, it cannot deal with matters of policy and procedure that it should be promoting and thinking progressively about how the school is managing itself, thinking long-term about the school community. How anyone can feel that they are playing on a level playing pitch in the school community if they do not have the ability to make a voluntary contribution, regardless of whether the school has a progressive and open-minded view as to who can afford and who cannot? If one feels as if one cannot afford to contribute, that will impinge on the way that one will engage. This could be the beginning of a conversation on how we fund our schools, how our schools are managed, and the way we view education as a public good, and not something to be purchased. We should not have an expectation that parents' associations fundraise, that voluntary contributions are collected and that books are paid for. Other societies have made different value judgments about education and they have cleared the conversation about finance to one side because it has nothing to do with education and they have maximised this beautiful relationship between the teacher, child and parents and the school and money has no place in this conversation. If this is the beginning of a road to achieve that, we are all for it and the Labour Party will support it, but it is worthy of us to have the conversation. I cannot expect the Minister to say he totally agrees with me, and has a bag of cash to change the way we have always done things overnight. I accept that, but if we are enshrining in legislation an understanding that there will always be a voluntary contribution, that is a failing. If we are empowering on one level but accepting this transactional relationship on another, we are not achieving as much as we could have. I appreciate the good place that this is coming from. The power imbalance has been there in the past and the legislation is trying to address that but, as other speakers have rightly said, there is a bigger conversation to be had about how the school system is funded, the way the Department is willing or unwilling to engage in the day-to-day management of schools, the way the system is organised in the North of Ireland and how we could replicate that in the South and having a deeper and more profound vision of how education can lift up, set free and liberate every child in the land. It should never be relegated by a conversation about money.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Last week, we spoke about Brexit and President Trump but, unfortunately, every time I stand in this Chamber, things seem to have got worse on both fronts. We will have an opportunity to criticise the budget later, but we should take a moment to recall that it is not that long ago that budget day was a very traumatic day for Irish people, when there was great discomfort and unrest outside the gates of Leinster House. Whatever queries or qualms one may have about today's announcement, it is notable that we have moved on from the crisis to a possibly better place. Certainly, when one contrasts what has happened with the Budget Statement in these Houses today with what is happening in the UK and in America, and the decision yesterday by President Donald Trump to withdraw from Syria, there is much to be said for what is happening in Ireland currently. We have allies in the United Kingdom. I should put on record the thanks of everybody in Ireland to Ms Bonnie Greer's comment on the BBC last week that Ireland owes the UK nothing and that we owe it no quarter or no concessions. On another matter, will the Leader facilitate a discussion with the Minister for Health, when time permits in the coming weeks, on the need for a national autism strategy? It has come to my notice that there are many things we must improve in that area. Many parents are struggling to find school places for their children. The system currently demands that they find the school places themselves. There is also a lack of early intervention, long waiting lists and so forth.The time for a national autism strategy has arrived. We could start that debate in this House. It would greatly benefit parents who have a child with a diagnosis of autism, which they are struggling with, trying to get their heads around and find challenging. At the same time, parents seem to have to go to war with the system rather than the system embracing and working with them. A national autism strategy is needed and I would greatly appreciate a debate on the matter.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On a point of order, we all want to have a chance to speak. Colleagues should allow Senator Horkan to finish.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. There is much political theatre on budget day. Members of the Opposition make all sorts of statements about the budget that is presented and are expected to criticise everything, while the Government criticises everything they state. I earlier stated that, at least on one level, the Irish political establishment is in a happier space than it was seven, eight, nine or ten years ago when budget day was very traumatic for people outside the Houses, as well as, possibly, those inside the Houses, and there were mass protests and much upset, hurt and trauma. Perhaps we have reached a position whereby we can have a reasonable back and forth discussion on budgetary measures. We certainly appear to be in a far better political space than is the case in the United Kingdom, the United States or much of Europe. My party has been stating for quite some time that the Government should be trying to cut poverty rather than cut taxes. I am relieved that the Government has decided to dispense with the idea of abolishing the USC or implementing the €3 billion worth of tax cuts advocated at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis and in various speeches by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar. It should not be perceived as a weakness for a political party or a politician to change their mind on a matter but, rather, as doing the right thing.  The members of the Independent Alliance walk up to Government Buildings as though they are not in government and advocate for those with inherited wealth but not those with inherited poverty. Rather than advocating for those who need an increase in the State pension, they are advocating for access to medical cards for those with pensions twice as large. So much for being the voice within Government for the small person or the disadvantaged. On housing policy, I accept that if it were not for HAP, many more people would be homeless. However, the problem is that the Government is doubling down by putting €80 million into a failed policy. That money will end up in the hands of landlords. If it was doing so while overseeing the building by the State of much-needed housing on State lands, there may be an argument that HAP is necessary to fill the gap. However, for reasons I do not understand, the Government refuses to build State housing on State land. The answers to the current crisis lie in the solutions found to the housing problems of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s but, for some reason, Fine Gael and the Government believe that all the solutions can be found in the market. The problem is that the market has no conscience and it is motivated by profit. Landlords and developers are there to make money. Meanwhile, those who need housing will remain on a waiting list or in insecure accommodation. On education, I am in politics because of a bunch of children whom I used to teach in a disadvantaged school. There is nothing in the budget to improve the standard of their education. Nothing has been done on class sizes. It strikes me as very odd that the Government has chosen not to allocate the very small amount of money necessary to reduce class sizes at primary or secondary level, particularly in DEIS schools. The capitation increases provided for in the budget are tiny. There is a suggestion that a book scheme will be brought in and I welcome that because it would be unfair of me not to, having advocated for a free book scheme. However, the scheme laid out in the budget is ill-defined and appears to be a pilot programme. It is lumped in with capitation increases and a measure for small schools in a bracket that is allocated €4 million. If the Government is only spending €4 million on capitation, a book scheme and support for small schools, it is not genuinely prioritising the book scheme. There are tax changes for those at the higher end of Irish society and eligibility changes for those with better-than-average pensions, but the Minister announced that the increase in the minimum wage increase is to be deferred. It is very difficult to understand how that decision could be defended or justified. On the funding increases related to justice, people often forget that the Department is responsible for both justice and equality. Part of the Department deals with the sections of our society that need help, support and investment, such as the Traveller and LGBT communities, people with disabilities and, by way of gender equality measures, women. The increased funding for the Department to allow the recruitment of more gardaí is welcome. However, we cannot police our way out of inequality or crime. Rather, we must invest in addressing the causes of crime, which stem from inequality. It has been repeatedly stated that those who are most dispossessed and disconnected and more likely to fall into addiction are members of the communities I outlined, but investment in that area was not addressed in the budget speech, so I can only assume that it is absent. The issue of Brexit overarches the entire budgetary conversation. We need a budget to be passed and to have a functioning Government rather than political turmoil such as that in the United Kingdom. However, the types of measures that are to be introduced and the ideological decisions that have been taken show that the Government has failed in its endeavour to radically invest in or change how it or society addresses issues affecting those on the lower end of Irish society, such as those in minimum-wage employment, children in DEIS schools or those in insecure accommodation who are in need of housing. I am not accusing any member of the Government of coming from a bad place in terms of the preparation of the budget. I do not believe people in government or politics generally decide to construct budgets in order to entrench inequality or do harm.We come from different political traditions and the Minister has his way of doing things, while we have ours. It is healthy that people have different perspectives on things. The Government has had chances to bring about radical change by investing in things that would have made a significant difference and would have soothed the wounds that are still there, ten years on. This is also a missed opportunity. A small amount of money could have made a big difference. If I was working in a minimum wage job, I would be wondering why my increase is being deferred while those with inherited wealth are being advocated for. That will stick in the craw of many people.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Next Tuesday, 15 October 2019.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister's presence and that the Government is not opposing the Bill. I will again outline the motivations behind it. We are not trying to limit the funding available to schools but to pressure the State and the Department to increase capitation funding so that voluntary contributions will no longer be necessary. Arising from the passage of this Bill through the previous Stage, I had a meeting with some principals in Ballymun who were concerned that we were trying to take away an avenue of funding that they greatly need without providing replacement funding. It is important to state that we are not able to include elements of replacement funding in an Opposition Bill because it would then be ruled out of order. The Labour Party's pre-budget submission does speak about the need for the return of pre-crash levels of capitation, which would cost €25 million. We have spoken about a 50% increase in capitation for DEIS schools, which would cost €23 million and benefit these schools in Ballymun. We have also spoken about a school books scheme, which would cost approximately €40 million. We are trying - and I know the Minister appreciates this - to make the relationship between parents and schools one based on education rather than on money. Parents who are being asked for a voluntary contribution or for book rental scheme money and who are struggling are less likely to engage in school life. They just are. They are less likely to turn up to parent-teacher meetings, to hang around the school gate, or to come to school events. We can work on this together. We can have a process, but let us have a vision of free education which means that people never feel that money is a barrier between them and a proper conversation about their child's development or about their child's growing in the school environment. That is all we are trying to achieve here. While many schools will say they need voluntary contributions to survive, it is unreasonable to suggest they would not be able to do so. This Bill prohibits the connection between a voluntary contribution and the provision of a school service. It does not prohibit fundraising or anything else of that sort. It strikes me that parents' associations feel as if they are just fundraising bodies. It is all about money all the time. We are losing the capacity and goodwill in the school community to talk about education, child development, beauty, love, poetry, and all of the other things education should be about.I appreciate that the Minister is not opposing the Bill. I acknowledge hard questions will be asked about where the money is coming from but I have outlined the ethic we are coming from. We are coming from a genuinely good place. Since the Government is not opposing the Bill, we have the capacity to work on it together and achieve something. Obviously, replacement funding is needed. There is disappointment over the capitation announcement made by the Government yesterday but let us not dwell on that. Let us dwell on what we could achieve. This Bill comes from a good place, a decent place, a place that is trying to maximise the educational relationship between students, parents and schools. With that, I would appreciate the Minister's comments.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will speak to the Bill in a moment but I ask the Acting Chairman to allow me to thank the Minister for being on site in Artane this morning. It was very decent of him to do so. I was just coming from the school, which had suffered from an horrendous fire. That the Minister was present in person was of great comfort to the school. The school community and the children are devastated. Some of the teachers of the school are past pupils. The community appreciates the Minister's work. Perhaps his Department could work with the local authority fire officers across the country to assuage some of the fears about school buildings. I hope that, in a number of weeks, we will have a better tale to tell about the state of our buildings. At the site of the school in question, there is room for prefabs to be constructed. The school community will rally around. I thank the community for being so vigilant in informing the fire brigade the first thing this morning. I lost my seat in the last general election and was reminded of it a number of times in the months afterwards by people who told me I spent too much time talking about Travellers. That is the kind of attitude that exists in our society. The education system reflects the State and its value. It reflects who we are. For far too long in this country, the education system has been for a certain section of society, possibly comprising a majority of society, and everybody else had to fit in. The system was not for the latter. I taught in a particularly disadvantaged school. The history, geography, mathematics and Irish books did not really reflect their experiences at all. These were not Irish-dancing children but children who liked disco dance. They did not play Gaelic games but played soccer. Their history was one of the flats, tuberculosis, lockouts, dock work and leaving school at 14. Theirs was as valid a history as any other — as valid as the history in An tOileánach or Peig. The history books did not necessarily reflect their Ireland and what they knew to be true. It felt almost as if one were trying to squeeze children to understand an official Ireland when an official Ireland did not necessarily respect, understand or even recognise them. If we do not accept this Bill, not just in spirit but in its entirety, how can we begin to imagine an education system that will embrace the African-Irish, Polish-Irish, Lithuanian-Irish and Brazilian-Irish communities? How can we begin to imagine an education system that will embrace, love and empower all those communities if we cannot do it for the indigenous Traveller community? Senator Mac Lochlainn has spoken about this passionately over a number of years. The work of the Civil Engagement group of Senator Kelleher and others has been transformational in these Houses in getting people of different political backgrounds to come to an understanding of the necessity to move beyond where we always have been. Senator Mac Lochlainn has talked about the itinerancy report of the early 1960s, which always spoke about the Traveller issue as a problem that needs to be solved, and a problem that needs to be assimilated into what is normal as opposed to recognising what is right, just and decent, and what has an absolute right to exist and be celebrated. The celebration of a people was the whole argument about ethnicity. I thought we were getting somewhere when ethnicity was recognised by this Government, which garnered a level of celebration, but then an individual ran for the Presidency and completely and willfully misunderstood what ethnicity was all about yet secured 24% of the public vote, and one wonders. One wonders if a settled child who has never had an interaction with a Traveller child or Traveller family will get his or her information from? Will it be from the media or politics? God help us if we expect a child from the settled tradition to understand what the Traveller tradition is like if we expect him or her to learn from contemporary society, the media, politics, community and the society in which he or she lives. If that is the only avenue a settled child has to attain such understanding then he or she will just learn the prejudices, racism and wilful misunderstanding that I and most settled people grew up with. The State must take it upon itself, not as a concession or adopt a stance of "Ah, sure look it", but as a vindication of a right of a people that they are an intrinsic part of this nation and not something for which concessions must be made. Every Department needs to shift its mindset from one of this being a problem and something to facilitate. We do not have to talk about tolerance. People do not need to be tolerated. This nation needs to intrinsically understand the basic humanity of the existence of a community. Whether one hails from a flat complex in inner city Dublin, a Traveller community living on a halting site or from the place that seems to write all of the history books in official Ireland, one has as much of a right to one's history and tradition. Everyone on this island has the same right to his or her history and tradition in terms of the entirety of the nation. We have relegated identities but promoted other identities. That makes somebody from one of the relegated identities feel that the education is not theirs, that it does not celebrate them or believe in them. Relegation makes a Traveller feel that if he or she wants to get anywhere in his or her life then one must pretend to be settled in order to get somewhere. The history books tell Travellers that the people who have led this country or performed greatly in this country and are celebrated are not like them so they must change. It is a devastating message to convey to a Traveller child aged eight, nine or ten that if he or she wants to get anywhere he or she will have to be a little less Traveller.  It is awful for parents in this country when they realise that if their children are going to get somewhere they will have to be a little bit different from what they are, that what parents have passed on to their children and in terms of the way they are being raised, these children must be a little bit less than that to be accepted. People have said that we cannot control all of that, and we cannot control the prejudices that people of a certain generation have, and I mean my generation and older. We cannot control that necessarily but we can control an element of that in the education system. For us to consider this Bill as a concession to lobbying is a massive mistake. The people in the Department of Education and Skills should be tripping over themselves to congratulate Senator Kelleher, the Civil Engagement group and other Senators in this House and Deputies in the other House for wanting to promote the Bill. It reflects well on the Oireachtas that this is being promoted, asked for and demanded.  I suggest to the Minister that the hearts of nine year olds are easily broken and it is pretty devastating to learn that one is just not important enough because of who one is. We were in Artane this morning. The school will be rebuilt and in years to come the incident will be a bad memory. The community will get together again and things will be okay because there is enough love in that area. If one is a nine year old who discovers that because one is a Traveller and because the school textbooks and everything around the child in the school tells one that one must change a little bit to get on in life because there is nothing worth celebrating about one, and everything that one asks for is a concession from what is really is the mainstream because a person, as a Traveller, is not mainstream then that is a heartbreaking realisation to come to terms with. I would not want any child to come to that realisation.  This legislation is a lot about emotion, a beating heart and identity, which can be difficult to put into hard legalistic text. I know that the Department hates legislation because it lived by circulars for years, which is fine. This is hard legislation that seeks to underpin the identity rights of a people who are part of our nation. I shall repeat the following for the benefit of the Minister. If young children of this nation do not learn from their State-funded school - the organ of the State - about Traveller culture, heritage and to celebrate Traveller life then where else will they hear it?  The Labour Party group supports the Bill and will work with others to get it over the line. I appeal to the Minister to appeal to the better part of himself because he is a progressive Minister who believes in the right things in terms of education. I know in the cold light of day that he can improve on the amendments that he has tabled and make the Bill something that we can all be proud of.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath. I refer to the issue of FreeStyle Libre. Thousands of adults with type 1 diabetes will have to wait until next year to find out whether the HSE is prepared to lift restrictions on them accessing the new blood sugar monitoring technology known as FreeStyle Libre. This device has been credited with greatly improving the quality of life of people with the disease since it was approved by the HSE in April 2018, but only for those aged from four to 21 years.I am advocating today on behalf of a woman who is outside of that age bracket.  The HSE promised at the time to review the situation after 12 months once it was in a position to assess the cost of making the device available to children and young adults. In August, according to a spokesperson, the HSE had 12 months of data collated for review within the coming months. This would allow for the experience of patients and the "societal aspects of benefit" to be reviewed. Members may be aware that FreeStyle Libre, made by Abbott, is a small sensor worn on the skin with readings taken by scanning a hand-held device over the sensor. Unlike the finger prick test, there is no need to draw blood and continuous information about glucose levels can be obtained.  Diabetes Ireland has described the upper age limit on availability as "unfortunate" as it means that many adults cannot access the technology despite the support of their medical team. The HSE stated that it was committed to reviewing who can access this technology within a year but 18 months later, there is still no review. The device has been made available to some adults with type 1 diabetes based on exceptional need. However, diabetes specialist Dr. Ronan Canavan has said that he has made many applications over the past year with limited success. One such application on behalf of a 22 year old patient was refused initially and again on appeal. As I said, I am making representations on behalf of an adult woman. She needs this technology but is exasperated by the delay. Diabetes Ireland estimates that around 20,000 people have type 1 diabetes, including almost 3,000 children under 16. What is the HSE doing to ensure that adults who have this condition can access this much-needed technology?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for reading that reply. Its key line is: "The HSE intends that an update to the initial report, including details of the review, will be published after the review has been completed." Would the Minister of State accept that statement if he were in my place or if he were a person with type 1 diabetes aged over 21 and waiting more than 18 months for news of this technology that could benefit his or her quality of life? If he were me or the women I am representing, would he accept that?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I rise to pay tribute to the memory of Ana Kriégel. Sentences were handed down yesterday to the two boys responsible for her murder. Comments have been made in the media this morning as to how Ireland should react to the fact that we have two child murderers guilty of this heinous crime. It is important we remember Ana as a beautiful, talented, loved young girl. The dignity with which her family have dealt with this situation is quite inspirational. However, we must come to terms with this horrible event, discuss it and ensure that everything that can be done in these Houses to learn a lesson is done and that nothing of this nature can ever possibly happen again. Questions have been asked about the nature of child pornography and the extent of its availability. Questions have been asked about the availability of smartphones. Discussions have been had on the nature of the quite intensive and cruel bullying that seems to take place in many of our schools and among our young people. Bullying is not just an issue for young people but it certainly seemed to be a feature of this case. We therefore need to respond to this situation. If Ireland has produced two child murderers, and a child has been murdered, these Houses have a duty to react in a calm, considered way that might lead society in learning some lessons from this horrible tale. I also wish to raise the issue of autism services in north Dublin. I am constantly struck by the paltry level of service available on the north side of Dublin to parents of children diagnosed with autism, by the long waiting lists for early intervention and by the inability of parents to get school places for their children and associated issues. It seems that if a child is diagnosed with autism, rather than the system wrapping itself around him or her with the care one would expect, the parents must become part-time campaigners and often must go to war with the system to get the most basic of provisions.I would appreciate if the Leader could arrange a debate on the nature of the autism services both in north Dublin and across the country in order that we can get to the root of what is wrong and determine how we can correct it. I regularly meet parents of young children who are already completely and utterly exhausted. They are not looking forward to dealing with a system for years into the future that cannot adequately support then. Therefore, I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate a debate on this issue. 
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«First, we read today that more than 200 legal cases have been taken against parents due to school absenteeism issues and that more than 700 notices have been sent to parents across the country in the past year on the same issue. These are parents of children aged between six and 16, which is the legal requirement that children are to be in school who have missed 20 days or more. As the Leader will know, we passed all Stages of a Bill in this House that would bring four and five year old children under the auspices of the Education (Welfare) Act. This would mean that absenteeism could be addressed at an earlier stage in a child's school life. I ask the Leader if the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs could be asked to address the Seanad on the progress of that Bill through the other House of the Oireachtas because school absenteeism is an issue that can be best addressed at the earliest stage of a child's school life. If it can be addressed when the child is four or, more likely, five years of age in the school system, their patterns of school attendance will be greatly increased. If poor attendance has been embedded in the child's school experience until the age of six, before their legal requirement to be in school, that pattern of poor attendance will continue. I ask that the Minister would make herself available to come into the House to discuss the passage of this Bill, which she and the Government support. It is important that we see that legislation passed. Second, I want to put on the record of the House how disappointed I am with rhetoric coming from various by-election campaign candidates. Anybody who understands inequality understands that this affects children profoundly. If one is the child of a Traveller, a Nigerian, an Albanian or an asylum seeker-----
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am sorry. I am putting on the record of this House how important it is for all of us to understand the seriousness of inequality and the way rhetoric hurts children in particular who are from vulnerable communities. For the child of an asylum seeker, an immigrant, somebody in drug addiction or a Traveller, this sort of rhetoric will seep into their bones and possibly never leave them. I would remind all parties in this House, and all their candidates in this by-election, that they may want to win a by-election but the damage they are causing will far outweigh the importance of the election in which they are running.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Senator will have to watch his tone.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are looking to the Deputy.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Unfortunately, I must raise an issue I have raised continuously in the House, namely, criminality and murder on the north side of Dublin. It gives me no pleasure to have to raise it again because a young man was murdered on Sunday evening in Clonshaugh Avenue in Dublin 17. It is the fifth murder in the last seven months in this geographical location. The news cycle moves on quickly but I must reiterate the damage this type of event does to a family, community and area. Children are walking past Garda tape at the scene of the murder on their way to school. Time and again, I have called on the Minister for Justice and Equality to replicate in Dublin's north side what was done in the north inner city. When there was a spate of murders in the north inner city in February 2016, in fairness to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, he responded by getting every agency, actor and stakeholder into a room, regardless of their political backgrounds, to try to find a solution. A commission was put together and a report, known as the Mulvey report, was produced. Solutions were found that were not just policing solutions. We are asking for the same template to be applied in the geographical location of Dublin 17, Dublin 13 and parts of Dublin 5. We are asking every public representative, school and local agency, including the Northside Partnership and Preparing for Life in Darndale, to come together and come up with answers as to why this is happening in the first place and possible solutions to make it stop. There have been five murders in seven months. If any other geographical location in the country had five murders in seven months, I am quite sure the political reaction would be different. It is not good enough. Nobody in this House believes it is good that children are walking past murder scenes. One primary school on the north side had a murder take place outside its gate. There is a memorial to that individual outside the gate of the school. He was shot dead there. This is not normal and cannot be considered normal. I am trying to be constructive and am not trying to score party political points. It was this Government under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, that did the right thing in the north inner city and it is the same Government under the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, that can do the right thing in this geographical location on Dublin's north side. I cannot comprehend why it is felt that the news and politics have moved on when a young man of 22 years of age has been gunned down on Clonshaugh Avenue. It is as if it is just another news item. It is not good enough. It cannot be good enough and the Government must respond. If it did, I and every other Member of the House would support it in doing that.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«He wants to.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is there really?
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is a long way from the centre of Dublin.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We are paying for it all. We are paying for everyone. Go on the taxpayers.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the last hour of the debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 be substituted with a debate on crime and that the Minister for Justice and Equality be summoned to the House to discuss the issue of crime. I made comments yesterday on a murder that took place at the beginning of this week. That was the fifth such murder in seven months on the north side of Dublin. The situation is clearly out of control. If this had occurred in any other area of the country, the political system would have screeched to a halt and every available Minister would be seated around a table talking about it. That has not happened with regard to Coolock and that needs to change. We are asking for an amendment to the Order of Business to provide that the last hour of the scheduled debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 be substituted with a one-hour discussion on the issue of crime in Dublin and around the country, in light of the most recent murder at the beginning of this week.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is the proposal.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like to explain why I am not pressing it. I will take the Leader's goodwill at face value. Nobody wants to play politics with murder.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We want a substantial debate and a substantial statement from the Minister about the issue on Thursday week. I do not want to have a pre-written script that could have been read out last month or in the previous months. I want the Minister to come in here and accept the need for a commission and a task force on the north side of Dublin, as was done in the north inner city. If it takes the Minister a week to get his act together and to deliver that, I am happy to delay the debate.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am genuine about this. I am trying to be constructive.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If a week is needed to be constructive about it, I am happy to wait for a week.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Leader can use his influence.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There was a debate on crime two weeks ago, but there has been a murder since then. I will withdraw the amendment to the Order of Business in good faith on the basis that we have a real and substantive debate on crime, gangland crime, murder and drugs in this House next week.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We want some action taken as a result of that debate because it is life and death stuff.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«If it happened in any other part of the State, the ministerial wheels would be screeching.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I discovered with some disquiet an issue mentioned in the media yesterday. The Cabinet has given approval for changes in gambling legislation to allow stakes of €5 in gambling machines versus the current limit of 3 cent, with the maximum payout increasing from 50 cent to €500. These gambling machines have been proven to destroy many lives. I remember a campaign in the 1980s to ban one-armed bandits, as they were then called. I am completely perplexed as to where this has come from. Who is advocating for these changes? What lobby group has the ear of the Ministers who decided, apparently out of the blue, to increase the minimum stake from a number of cent to quite a number of euro and the maximum payout from 50 cent to €500. We have a culture now whereby people are beginning to talk more about addiction to alcohol, drugs, pornography and gambling. The UK is going in the opposite direction. I am confused as to the thinking behind this move in respect of gambling machines. Who is advocating in respect of it? Who will benefit from it? Do we really feel that society will be enhanced by having gambling machines that can accept higher stakes and pay out more money? This proposal emerged from the Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday. At the very least, we need to talk about this issue. A significant number of vested interests seem to get the ear of the Government. This particular move has been met with surprise and alarm. I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a debate as quickly as possible. I presume the Minister for Justice and Equality has responsibility in this area. Why are we doing this and who will benefit? Unless I am completely confused, from my reading of what is involved, this will be very damaging for people who already have gambling addictions. It will also be a gateway for people who do not necessarily have such addictions and it will suck them into something much more dangerous. We should not let this go without rigorous examination. I hope that, potentially, we might put a stop to it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister to the House. I called for this debate last week. I decided not to call a vote on the Order of Business on the day in question, which was a week and a day ago, to facilitate a debate this week. I did so in the hope that the Minister would produce something that would give a little hope to those of us who are trying to come up with a comprehensive response to what is happening in the Coolock area. However, it would be an understatement to say that I am disappointed with what we have heard from the Minister this afternoon. I would like remind the Minister of what happened in the north inner city at the beginning of this Government's term in office. It bears repeating that in response to a cycle of murder at that time, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, commissioned a task force. Every stakeholder in the task force came to the conclusion that we could not police our way out of the cycle of murder. The reasons behind the cycle had to be investigated. Why was it that every time a young man is murdered - it tends to be young men who get murdered - there always was someone else, possibly younger, willing to step into his place? The task force spoke to principals, teachers, community workers, people involved with the local drugs task force, representatives of community organisations and local public representatives. The proposals that the task force came up with seem to have worked because they indicated that the Government cared and wanted to get results. The task force is still in existence and the ripple effect of what it achieved is still being felt. I worked in a school in the north inner city approximately ten years ago at a time when there was a feud in the local area. I used to go to work every day during the feud, which had an indescribable effect on the children of the community. A dark cloud of fear and tension hangs over a school, a local area and an entire community while the violent crime associated with such a feud is ongoing. I am reluctant to name areas because I do not want to stigmatise them. I have spoken, however, to a school principal in the Dublin 17 area of a school that had a murder committed outside its gate. A little dedication to the young man who died is still in place outside the school gate. The principal told me about how traumatised his pupils were. We discussed the possibility that the school will lose a much-needed teacher. For the best part of a year, I have been asking in a non-partisan and constructive way for the Government to replicate in Dublin 17 what it did in Dublin 1. I am still not getting a "Yes". I just do not understand why the Government will not do this. I am asking it to collect a group of people in a room, where they will speak to something deeper and more profound than just policing. They should talk about inequality, job opportunities, educational disadvantage, the nature of drug use and the nature of pain and trauma. They should talk about the disadvantage that has resulted in five murders in seven months in the recent past. I am not the only person who has a terrible suspicion that if there were five murders in seven months in Stepaside, Portlaoise or Castleknock, there might be a different response from the Government. The Minister mentioned the national drugs strategy as a new way forward. I was one of nine former Ministers of State who signed a statement last month criticising the Government for its inability to hear the voice of the community sector in that strategy. Unbelievably, every former Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, going back to the 1990s, signed this statement. We come from three different political parties. Nobody wants to make political hay out of murder. Although I genuinely have no interest in trying to score political points out of murder, I think people in this House, in the other House and in society need to know that this is not normal. The idea of a child walking past crime scene tape on the way to school should break everybody's heart. The State should do absolutely everything in its power to ensure such a scene is not repeated. The Minister could have walked in today and said that he has listened to what we have said and appreciates the success of the initiative in Dublin 1, where people feel that the State is working well because community organisations and local representatives are being listened to. The Minister could have acknowledged that we cannot police our way out of this and explained that he knows what comes from disadvantage and disempowerment. He could have said he knows the Government needs to have engagement with the Garda but that other issues must be talked about as well. In fairness, what the Government did in Dublin 1 seems to have had a level of success and should be replicated in another area where there has been a cycle of murder. If the Minister had taken such an approach, I would have been the first person to say that he has his finger on the pulse, understands the issues and is advocating for solutions. I would have been the first person to congratulate him. However, I cannot do so because I have not heard what I need to hear. I am genuinely lost for words because it would be so simple. If the Minister were to act on my recommendation, he would get such engagement and such appreciation from families that are suffering from drug intimidation. I have been told that parents are not allowing their children to go outside any more. If one visits certain parts of the north side in glorious sunshine, one does not hear the laughter of children as they play. Their parents are keeping them inside because of the nature of the atmosphere in which they are living and growing up. Families are saying they just want to get out. When I proposed the idea of a task force, I was trying to get beyond the classic Punch and Judy debate on Garda numbers that goes over and back between the Opposition and the Government. I was trying to find something deeper, more profound and longer lasting. The Minister has just rebuffed it. He was a member of the Government that established the north inner city task force. The current Government can deliver on the proposal I have made but the Minister has said that it does not intend to do so. I just do not get it. We needed to have a campaign for a new Garda station in Dublin 13. It was announced in June that this campaign had been successful. We appreciate the decision that has been made in this regard because the many new families in this growing community need a proper policing resource. However, if the Minister thinks that coming in here and giving us a list of Garda numbers will solve the issue, he is wrong. I honestly do not think he gets it.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will finish on this point. I appreciate that the Acting Chairman has allowed me some extra time. I want the Minister to know that I am sick of hearing about murder in the community I try to serve. I have tried to be constructive. I am honestly lost for words as I try to understand why the Minister does not see this as I do. Why does he not feel the need to commission a task force that might come up with solutions that ensure no more children in this community have to walk past Garda tape on their way to school because another murder has taken place? I feel like I am wasting my time.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman. Our guest speakers are all very welcome; this is a wonderful occasion, which one speaker has called historic, which it really is. I thank Senator Collette Kelleher and the civic engagement group for organising this meeting and being so persistent in pursuing the rights of the Traveller community in this House for the past three years that I have been here.Political representation in these Houses has been mentioned a lot. It is something we want to support. Having a designated Seanad seat for the Traveller community is an excellent idea, one that has been mentioned before in many different fora. Has how that would come into play been examined? Would it require an overhaul of the entire Seanad electoral system? Would it require a constitutional amendment because it is a feature of the Constitution? It is a constitutional House. Alternatively, is it something that could be done much more simply? I would prefer something that was written in stone rather than being at the whim of a Taoiseach because that post can change.  My second question concerns hate speech legislation. We have struggled for a long time to get around to strengthening our hate speech laws because there is a strong lobby that promotes the idea of free speech, which is understandable, but those who are at the rough end of hate speech are members of very vulnerable groups. The Traveller community are at the rough end of hate speech. There are journalists who write opinions that they would not get away with in any other country but they can write them in this country because of our hate speech laws and there are political parties and representatives within political parties who have made comments that would have landed them in court in any other country.  My questions concern the mechanisms about how we can enshrine that Seanad seat for the Traveller community as a permanent seat in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the witnesses' views on hate speech legislation and how we can turn the tide on the racist views that are given out about many different communities in society, but particularly the Traveller community, without check. Of all the communities with which I, and I am sure, my colleagues, have worked, the Traveller community always comes back to the table with solutions and positivity when often it would be an awful lot easier to walk away from the table and believe that nobody will ever listen. I congratulate the witnesses. I am humbled by their presence and their presentations.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Without wishing to restate the case, I agree completely with the points made by Deputy Brendan Ryan.  For the sake of brevity, I simply wish to add my voice to the points made.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to return to the Minister of State's response to Deputy Brendan Ryan and other Deputies on the establishment of the Bill and the review process.  May I have further clarification on how he considers it will take place and the mechanisms surrounding it and if he will incorporate some of the suggestions made by Deputies?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With regard to the establishment of the Bill and fund, the committee could work with the Minister and have a certain scope to address some of the issues that have been discussed here today.  Is there a potential for that?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Will a review take place every year?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Minister will deal with the amendments, and amendment No. 35, which is along similar lines.  A strong message must go out from across this committee expressing our disappointment at the reaction of the religious orders and congregations and that we have received only €21 million at this juncture.  We are talking about a fund of €110 million and every member of this committee believes more has to be done, but stitching amendments into the Bill in terms of six months, interest and so on is unrealistic at this stage.  However, we can at least agree that the responsibilities of the religious orders leave a lot to be desired.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman. I would like to have been put closer to teacher's desk for behaviour.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their attendance. I will go through a few issues and get their comments on them. The issue of two-tier pay and pay equality is coming up regularly within schools and the Minister may wish to make reference to that. The Minister of State referred to medical-grade face coverings for SNAs but while schools are trying to power their way through this pandemic, any sort of tension within the system needs to be resolved, and I am wondering whether a further comment could be made on that. On the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, decrease being immediately transferable to DEIS schools, I appreciate the Minister said this was debatable, that she was alive to the issue and wants to resolve it but is it not the case that any PTR decrease should automatically be transferred to these schools? Is that not desirable for the future? It should not depend on a fund or how well-meaning the Minister is. If we were to go back into a crisis lockdown, which none of us wants but which none of us can predict, what is the capacity of the system to respond to that in terms of remote learning and the digital divide? Some principals I have been talking to said that 60% of their students are working off smartphones. Does the Minister feel we are in a position if we were to go back into lockdown to respond to that? I am happy with the Minister of State's comments on school places for children with autism because there has been an issue in my constituency of parents applying to between 14 and 17 different schools to get a place for their child. She may wish to elaborate on that issue as well because it is quite a big one in the area I represent. She briefly mentioned the potential for further debate on the issue of autism and how we can deal with it into the future and, therefore, I would appreciate further comment on that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate what the Minister said about housing and we can return to that. He probably knows what I am going to ask about. I am interested in the €8 million fund for education disadvantage. I am very excited about the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and about the Minister and Minister of State who are working in it.  Some 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate. Are people aware of that statistic? Do they know what functional illiteracy means? How can we grasp this issue as a country and drive it down? Making our people literate is a major challenge but it is even bigger when people do not even realise the problem exists. That one in six of Irish adults are functionally illiterate should set alarm bells ringing. I am greatly encouraged that the Minister has been to the forefront of raising the matter. He is trying to find solutions and funding mechanisms to tackle it. I ask the Minister to expand on that. Along with other members of this committee I am determined to work with both the Ministers to achieve improvements in that area in the period of this Oireachtas. Many people in all age ranges have that severely debilitating issue, which minimises their capacity to fully engage in Irish society. It is truly crippling. I will continue to ask the Minister how we can work together to highlight it and hopefully resolve it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister of State for being here. When the announcement was made that the Department of Education of Skills was to be split up and that the Department in which the Minister of State now serves was to be established, I was not convinced. I did not make any public comment at the time because I was interested to see how it would work out. I am, however, genuinely enthused as to how it has worked out. It was a good move. We are now putting an emphasis on this aspect of education, which was previously swamped in the larger Department. The traditional Department of Education can now focus on the primary and secondary sectors and on other bits under its remit while we can speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and to the Minister of State regarding this specific area. I believe he acknowledged in his contribution that a number of policy areas had been allowed to drag and had not really been tackled. The funding issue is central to that. While I appreciate the reason we are here, I might ask the Minister of State a general question or probe him a little bit more. He has mentioned the Cassells report. Did he say that it had gone to the European Commission?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is due back. I do not want to put the Minister of State in the position of making predictions with regard to how we should proceed but there are certainly a number of pinch points in the system. Every single third level institution and college of further education says that it is underfunded. Meanwhile, there is a feeling that there is too great a burden on the individual student or on his or her family. As was alluded to earlier, those of our political persuasion have a vision of free education or education funded exclusively by the taxpayer. The previous Government ruled out any sort of student loans scheme quite strongly. I do not mean to put the Minister of State on the spot but can he give us a sense of how we could work together as a committee to tease through these solutions? There is no quick fix or easy answer. It is not as simple as saying that a given ideological position is much better than any other. I remember when this idea first came to the fore, which I myself benefited from, the argument was made that families who would have spent money on third level education would spend it instead on fee-paying schools to which they would not previously have had access. The argument was that it would only benefit the middle class and that it would not open third level education up to a whole cohort of students who had previously been locked out. It is arguable whether that was actually the case.  As to the future funding of third level education generally, will the Minister of State comment as to how effective this new Department will be in driving that debate? Will he give us some indication as to where he feels we need to go?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I knew I was straying. That is why I was trying to be nice.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What are the demographic pressures on the Department? Does the Minister of State have a sense of how many more young people, or people in any other age bracket, will be entering third level education? Will more strain be put on the system?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The issue is that the numbers do not stand still.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Ministers. I have two specific questions. One relates to the funding that has been put aside or prioritised to ensure children can catch up and not just that they can return to school. In addition to making adjustments to schools and providing more personal protective equipment, PPE, or hand sanitiser, they need to be able to ensure children can regain what they lost. What funding is available in that regard? I have previously spoken to the Minister about the £1 billion catch-up fund for children in the UK. There do not appear to be specific measures in place for children, especially those from a disadvantaged background, to analyse and then to ensure they can repair some of the damage caused by not being in school, notwithstanding that they were being taught or that efforts were made to teach them as best we could. My second question relates to demographic pressures. In my constituency many parents cannot find a place for their child at second level. This may be more of a policy measure than a financial one. What kind of funding mechanisms does the Department have to ensure areas of the country undergoing demographic pressures can have increased access to second level schools? I have a further question on face coverings for oral exams, but that may be a discussion for a different time. Perhaps the Minister could communicate with me separately on that. I ask her to respond on the catch-up fund for children and on investments to ensure the pressures as a result of demographic changes can be eased to allow for greater access to second level places. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State. My contribution will be on the same themes. We are anxious that an assessment be ongoing within the Department of the damage that has been done to the educational experience of children and young people. Covid is still having a massive effect and influence on children's and young people's day-to-day educational experience. I would not want the Department to assume that the catch-up fund that has been introduced will be enough. Clearly, young people are still having difficulty in their young school lives. They are wearing masks from third class up, as per the public health advice, and at second level. The windows are open and teachers are continually absent. Even though that might not be reported on as much as it was in January, it is still a day-to-day reality. I would like to get a sense from the Minister of the continuing work the Department is doing to assess that damage that is being done, understanding all the while that it is absolutely important that schools remain open and that public health advice is followed. In that regard, does the Minister have a sense as to when the mask mandate, particularly in primary schools, may be lifted? I am interested in what the Minister had to say about school secretaries. That matter should absolutely have been resolved by now and the Department should have been much more to the fore in getting it resolved. I am conscious of the SNAs and their campaign to have the minimum necessary qualifications to become SNAs increased. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that. I wish to ask about school books. The Minister will know that I keep raising this issue because progress on it is very much achievable. Far too many parents in our school communities have discussions about money. Voluntary contributions are still a real part of school life. Management bodies say that if voluntary contributions were to be banned, there would be a €45 million hole in the day-to-day running needs of schools. We could just fill that and not have the need for voluntary contributions. As a politician, I am now already in the post-Covid restrictions era, getting communications from local schools that are holding fundraisers. They want support from their local Deputy to take out an advertisement and so on. I find it pathetic that schools must continually hold fundraisers for their running costs. It is appalling. It is ridiculous. We have to recast our brains totally as to what the normal function of a school is. Parents' associations are fundraising bodies. Principals are chasing money all the time. It is all about fundraising, money, asking parents for book money, etc. Given all that, I ask about a long-term vision for schools to be self-funded from the Department rather than having to ask parents for money or to have fundraising-type dynamics in school communities. That is just exhausting. If parents do not have the money, they feel as if they cannot engage fully in the school community. If they cannot pay the bills, are they going to go to school fundraiser? Unlikely. I am sorry; I appreciate that my time is almost up. My main point is about school books. Parents in Northern Ireland do not pay for their children's school books. In fairness, the Minister has rolled out a scheme that benefits approximately 101 schools. The number went from 52 originally to 101. Does she have a vision, or is there a vision in her Department, to roll that out to every primary school and secondary school over time? I believe it would cost €20 million at primary level and €20 million at secondary level. That could change the whole dynamic such that principals are not chasing after parents for book money, parents are not running around trying to get books and the conversation becomes less about money and more about education. If they can do it in the North of Ireland, I am pretty sure we could do it here too.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 5:In page 13, to delete lines 28 and 29 and substitute the following:“ “students’ union” means an independent and self-governing body, recognised by a higher education provider or by the Minister, that is established for the purpose of promoting the general interests of students of a designated higher education institution, and of representing students, both individually and collectively, in respect of their well-being and academic, disciplinary and other matters arising within that institution;”. Many of the amendments I have put forward are to strengthen the role of trade and student unions, to provide greater transparency and ensure that too much power is not vested in one individual. We are trying to have a better definition of a student union in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy to work with the Minister on that. Our concern is that the Bill contains the phrase "student union or other student representative body", which could mean anything. It could be a number of students without any mandate or who have been appointed by the education provider.The Minister can understand our need to nail into the legislation a more robust definition of what a student union is. I will take the bona fides of the Minister and work with him on it, however. I will not be pressing the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to speak in support of the Bill and to reiterate a point made by Deputy Conway-Walsh in respect of primary school teaching. Currently, more primary school teachers are trained by a private online college than in any other way. That does have an impact. It could have a negative impact in future if it is not regulated and if the ethic that underpins the Bill is not stated, such as in the form proposed by the amendment. It started as an add-on to teacher training but it is now the primary provider of teacher training. The amendment is an important rebalancing of the ethics behind what we are trying to achieve.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 18:In page 16, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:
"Academic freedom
9. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying or restricting the principle of academic freedom as provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997.".We want to protect the concept and the principle of academic freedom within the Bill. The definition of academic freedom is, "A scholar's freedom to express ideas without risk of official interference or professional disadvantage." It is obviously something we should respect and cherish in a democratic society. Therefore, it needs to be explicit within the Bill. That is why I have tabled amendments Nos. 18 and 19.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I appreciate the Minister's response. Effectively, he is saying there is nothing in the Bill that undermines academic freedom and academic freedom is protected in separate legislation. That is all the more reason for it to be enshrined or explicitly referenced within the Bill. As the Minister is aware, we live in turbulent times. One never knows what is around the corner. On that basis, the principle of academic freedom should be in every piece of legislation we deal with. That is why I will be pressing these amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 19: In page 16, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:«“(c)«support and recognise the application of the principle of academic freedom,”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 40:«In page 18, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: «“Direction and guidelines to be published«13. The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and to be published on the Minister’s website— «(a) any direction issued under section 11, and«(b) any guidelines issued under section 12.”.I tabled this amendment in the interest of transparency.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I withdraw my amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 43:In page 20, to delete lines 7 to 9 and substitute the following:“(b) Not less than three of the persons appointed under paragraph (a) shall be students or full-time officers of a national student union, nominated by the Board.(c) Not less than one of the persons appointed under paragraph (a) shall be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to represent the interests of staff.”.This amendment was discussed with amendment No. 5 but I reiterate that we are trying here in the Bill to rebalance from one to three the number of appointments who are student representation. I also re-emphasise the fact that representation for non-academic staff in these institutions is crucial. The institutions cannot function without them and they often go unrepresented or unheard. This is the basis behind the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Chairman is ahead of me. I am sure the Minister will look at my amendments as I believe that was his indication on amendment No. 5. I will come back on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 60:In page 32, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“(c) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education,”.On the same theme of the strategy in this legislation, all the conversations we have had about the sector for which the Minister is responsible have come down to funding. It is a hot topic of conversation. This has been going on for years and it is the elephant in the room in any conversation about higher or further education. Within the context of the strategies laid out by the Minister, therefore, I feel strongly that the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education must be included in such a strategy and that this aspect must be contained in the legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With that in mind, we will reflect on the amendment. We reserve the right to resubmit on Report Stage but I will withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 64 on the basis of what the Minister said. However, I will point to the reference to representatives of students or students' unions. We have spoken about this matter previously and I hope it can be addressed. It is welcome that trade union representation is included but that reference to representatives of students or students' unions, which looks small, may not be small if it is not ironed out. I have made this point already. We may revisit the issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is exactly my concern.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The inclusion of the word "or" is problematic.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 68:In page 32, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following: “(e) recognised trade unions and staff associations in the designated institutions of higher education,”. In fairness, the Minister has recognised this issue in previous amendments. However, we feel strongly about the inclusion of recognised trade unions and staff associations in this part of the Bill for the reasons already outlined. I re-emphasise the point that many people who work in these institutions are not academic staff and, therefore, need proper representation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I can probably withdraw my amendments. The sequencing of the amendments is a little fortunate for the Minister and not for me.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will withdraw amendment No. 68.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 89:In page 34, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“(b) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education,”. I will withdraw this amendment and try to move it again on Report Stage. That is the best thing to do in the circumstances.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Excellent. I thank the Minister. I will withdraw the amendment and try to move it again on Report Stage. That is probably the best thing to do in the circumstances.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 92:In page 34, line 26, to delete “consultation” and substitute “partnership”. This is a very simple proposition, that the word "partnership" is stronger than the word "consultation". It is as simple as that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On that basis I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but it is contingent on my being happy with the Minister's endeavours between now and Report Stage. We will move on a basis of good faith.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On that basis, yes. If the Minister is working on the language-----
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 95:In page 35, between lines 36 to 37, to insert the following:“(b) in developing a funding framework under paragraph (a), An tÚdarás consult with the designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies.”.Again, this is all about consultation. The amendment inserts a line that concludes, "An tÚdarás consult with the designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies". It is purely to make the Bill more robust when it comes to consultation.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 104:In page 37, line 5, after "section 126" to insert "or to adequately explain non-compliance in accordance with section 126(7)*".This is on conditions of funding. Section 38 states:(1) Funding that is provided by An tÚdarás to a funded body under section 37 shall be paid in such manner, and subject to such conditions, as the Chief Executive Officer specifies in writing to the body.(2) The conditions, referred to in subsection (1), that a funded body in receipt of funding under section 37 shall comply with shall be consistent with the objects and functions of An tÚdarás provided for in this Act and may include a requirement on the body—Paragraph (d) indicates "to comply with the guidelines, codes and policies issued by An tÚdarás under section 126,". We are suggesting the addition of "or to adequately explain non-compliance in accordance with section 126(7)*". Again, there must be a level of transparency and if there is non-compliance, it should be explained.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«As is generally the case with these matters, if the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendment we will try to work on it and bring it back on Report Stage. It is what I intend to do.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 105:In page 37, line 7, after "requirements," to insert "and".This is a simple insertion of the word "and" after paragraph (f). Amendment No. 106 would delete "thereunder, and" and substitute "thereunder.". It is a question of strengthening the language. Amendment No. 107 would delete lines 9 and 10 on page 37.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That would be to our liking. As can be seen in the Act, the autonomy of the CEOs is a little bit too strong so board approval will be appreciated. I will withdraw on that basis.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 106:In page 37, line 8, to delete “thereunder, and” and substitute “thereunder.” 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 107:In page 37, to delete lines 9 and 10. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 119:In page 42, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:“(e) recognised trade unions and staff associations in designated institutions of higher education,”.There is a very comprehensive list in the legislation of those who should be consulted with when preparing a draft plan but the glaring omission is the trade unions and staff associations in designated institutions of higher education. I see Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh makes the same point. If we have a comprehensive list of those who should be consulted, the trade unions need to be in there.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I had a whole speech prepared.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Does the Minister want to speak to it?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy with that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 134:In page 58, line 4, to delete "is concerned" and substitute "has serious, significant or material concerns".What I am trying to outline with this amendment is the nature of "concern". I want to replace the word "concerned" with "serious, significant or material concerns". That is a slightly more robust definition of what a concern may be, a concern that the CEO may have about the governance of an institution, that it should be serious, significant or material.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I may need more convincing in respect of why approval of the board is required in section 64 but not in section 65. However, similar to Deputy Conway-Walsh, I will withdraw my amendment and consider what the Minister does on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 141:In page 59, lines 25 to 29, to delete all words from and including “not” in line 25 down to and including line 29 and substitute the following:“operate to stay the coming into operation of the measure pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 142:In page 60, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“(4) A decision by the Chief Executive Officer to provide assistance under subsection (1) may be appealed by the designated institution of higher education concerned in accordance with section 70 within the prescribed period after the service of a notice on that institution under subsection (2).(5) The bringing of an appeal by a designated institution of higher education against a decision to provide assistance under subsection (3) shall operate to stay the provision of such assistance pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.”.I am interested in the Minister's view, to speed things along.

The Bill states, "two persons having a special interest in or expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education or the functions of An tÚdarás". We are replacing that with, "one person having a special interest in or expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education or the functions of An tÚdarás (other than a member of the Board, a member of the staff of An tÚdarás, a public servant or a person employed or engaged by in institution of higher education)".

The Minister might comment on the amendment.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will speak to it now. I presume that the Minister would agree with me that the student voice is often relegated. It happens right throughout education. Most of the discussions that take place are about learning, and about those who may learn, without those people having input at the top table. Within all of that, I have to congratulate the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, today on elevating the issue to a higher area of responsibility than had been there before. In the Bill, there is a provision for two student members. We are simply proposing that it would be increased to three. I think that would be a better balance. By having three within themselves as a body, it is easier for them to have a coherent view on something, rather than having two opposing views. The Minister might see where I am coming from there. We would like the Minister to move from two members to three members to strengthen the student voice.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Notwithstanding the Minister's goodwill towards my motivation, I am crushingly disappointed by her attitude to the Bill and by the Department's response to the Bill. It flies completely in the face of what the Minister is trying to do this week in respect of section 37A of the Education Act. We are told to rush through legislation this week in order for it to be ready for September, yet we are told that schools cannot change their admissions policies for this September or even the following September. The Minister tells me there is no evidence this provision has any effect. Why is it there, then? The very basis of the argument is that if even one child is disadvantaged by the provision, it needs to go. I am blue in the face making the same argument over and over again but I will make it again. This provision was inserted at the behest of those who are trying unfairly to keep an elitist bloodline running through certain schools' admissions policies, from grandfather to father to son or from grandmother to mother to daughter. It is patently unfair on, for example, children of early school leavers, children whose parents are not from the area and, indeed, children whose parents are not from Ireland. We can say all we want about Ukrainian students in this State, but I ask the Minister to imagine if even one Ukrainian was not able to access a second level school place on the basis of this provision because there are greater rights for those whose parents or grandparents went to the school in question. The lack of energy or understanding on the part of the Department on this baffles me because there is no argument against what I and the committee and people such as Deputy Ó Laoghaire, who supported this Bill, are trying to achieve. This provision should not have been put into law in the first place; it should not still be there. I ask the Minister to imagine even one family in this State saying in years to come: "We had hoped our child might be admitted to second level school A, but it was not possible because my parents did not go to school." In a Republic, it should make us all deeply ashamed that such a provision exists. I remember the previous debate we had on this in the Dáil. I walked into the Chamber and was excited as to what the Minister might provide. I remember my first contribution being to the effect that I hoped she had come to the table with some level of understanding as to how we could collectively work together. I was crushed by her presentation because I believe in these Houses of the Oireachtas and I believe there is no opposition, really, to what we are trying to achieve here.Education is everything. It is all that has benefited some families to break out of poverty. Education is the only opportunity unless one's parents have money. This is why it is so emotivel and so important. I would ask the Minister to reconsider her position and the Department's position on this. The Minister could easily row in behind this. The provision could easily be deleted. Every school in the country only has to change its enrolment policies for September 2023. It is as simple as that. One no longer gets to choose a child whose parents or grandparents went to this school over some other child. It is as simple as that. It is having an effect in areas that I represent or on parents who come to me from all over the country. It is patently wrong and patently unfair. The argument that we cannot be sure how many people are affected by it does not stack up. It should not be there and it needs to go. In summary, I have been leading this process. I was delighted to be in the position to bring it forward. The Department told me that the Minister would delay Second Stage for 12 months in order to do all the groundwork that needed to be done and I waited patiently from November 2020 to November 2021. The Minister knows that is true. We delayed the passing of Second Stage for 12 months. We are in a position where the Minister comes back to this table and I am patiently waiting here for this Bill to be passed, but we want more reviews and we want to see how schools can have a number of admissions cycles to work through it. What the Minister is doing is wrong. The Minister knows it is wrong. The Department knows its wrong. I do not know what lobby group has such a hold over the Department that this needs to stay. I can imagine who they are. On this issue, the Minister needs to change her position. The Minister needs to row in behind the Bill. This section of the Act needs to be deleted. We could all go back to normal and look children in the eye in September 2023 and say that it does not matter who one's parents or grandparents are.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for reaching out to our party after the loss of Niamh Bhreathnach, a former Minister for Education. We appreciated the Minister's condolences and kind comments to our party and to her family. Niamh was associated with the original Breaking the Cycle scheme, so I will initially speak about DEIS. As the Minister outlined, there has been an investment and approximately 25% of all schools now fall under the DEIS programme. I appeal to her about possibly having an extra stratum of DEIS, such as a DEIS plus, for acutely disadvantaged schools that may need to be given extra priority. I will leave that remark there, though, particularly as the Minister referred to the ongoing review of DEIS. The Minister's comments on class sizes are welcome. I commend her on reducing class sizes within DEIS schools as well.There is a different staffing schedule for DEIS and non-DEIS schools but the Department has done both simultaneously, so that is welcome. As was mentioned, the free school books scheme is due to be rolled out in September. It is limited to primary schools and I can appreciate that because a second level scheme would be much more complex. However, principals are beginning to ask when they will get information on it, how it will be operational, if it is an opt-in and opt-out scenario, and if there will be a mandate of every school. There have been school book rental schemes where not every school took them up. I want to get some more clarity on the proposal because we do not want a situation where some schools just do not opt in and parents who may really be in need of this scheme are not able to avail of it. On school transport, will we have the same scheme as last year for next September? There are still issues and my colleague in Cork, Peter Horgan, says that, in Mount Oval in Cork, 50 children are still off the bus. I want to get clarity on that. School places in second level education are becoming a real issue. Does the Minister anticipate a scenario where the Department may have to provide more school places in particular pinch points in the commuter belt around Dublin or in Dublin itself for schools that are massively oversubscribed? The Minister knows my position on the 25% of school places that can be set aside for children or grandchildren of past pupils, and we would seek her support for the fast-tracking of that Bill. That being said, is the Department looking at those pinch points? On counselling services, more funding will be needed for the school completion programme counselling services. What is the Minister’s view on that? Has she identified schools that will be involved in the €5 million mental health counselling programme that is due to start in September 2023? I have two last points and I appreciate that I am throwing a lot at the Minister. I refer to the results date for the 2023 leaving certificate. It was indicated last year that we would have similar problems around the resourcing of the marking of exams and the timing of those results in 2023. Does the Minister have a sense of when that might be or how late it would be? My last point is on the reconfiguration of schools, and I have an issue in Raheny in my constituency. I would ask the Department to take more ownership of that process. If the roll-out of the review or consultation in Raheny is anything to go by, none of these processes will be successful. It led to quite a bit of chaos, a lot of division and not much light out of it at the end. I just wanted to make that point. I would appreciate it if the Minister would reflect on the points I have made.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The identification of the schools.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On the point of second level school places, I do not need a comment on the reconfiguration of schools. I am just happy for the Minister to have heard what I have said.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«There is a process ongoing in Raheny, so we will let that go.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The Labour Party Private Members' Bill provided for ten days' sick leave, and rising to 30. I suppose my party's concern with the Bill is that it is not robust enough and that aspirations, as has been suggested, from the Minister of State, Deputy English, and from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, are not hard wired into the Bill. We want to delete the same lines and to insert, "An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister ..." The Minister would have within his or her power the ability to increase that to 30 days over a period of time, but we have to start with ten. That is our strong view. If the Minister of State does not accept the amendment, I would be happy to discuss it or to try to convince him about a period of time, but we intend to push it again on Report Stage. However, I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«On our amendment, the circumstances are frustrating. It is a bit like talking to a residents’ group about a planning application in that what is in the planning application is what matters. What is in the legislation is what matters, not what the Minister of State said here or what the Tánaiste said, or what is said in any media interview about aspirations. If it is in the legislation, it is in the legislation. No Minister will be in breach of the law or regulations if he or she still stands over three sick-leave days in five, ten or 15 years, because it will be covered by the legislation. That is it. The Minister of State may aspire to increase the number to ten but it is not written down. That is not how we do business. It almost feels as if the Government views the sickness of an employee in terms of how it affects the employer rather than the employee. That is not how we should do our business, I contend. Following on from what Deputy Paul Murphy said, how did the Government come up with the number of days? How does it equate with the European norm? How are we supposed to do our legislative work if aspirations uttered by Ministers are not written down in black and white?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily because we have work to do. The Minister of State has just committed to a review of how this legislation will affect employers over time. Can I assume the same review will investigate how it is protecting the health of workers? Our conversation already feels imbalanced.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, to delete lines 23 to 25 and substitute the following: “(2) An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister under section 6.”.I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that I want to resubmit it on Report Stage. We are trying to work with the Minister of State and encourage him to strengthen the Bill and have our vision of ten days stitched into the Bill. Otherwise, we would not be in a position to support the Bill on Report Stage. We will give the Minister of State time to work with us and his officials in order that when we get through Report Stage, we will have a better Bill.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 4:In page 5, to delete lines 30 to 32 and substitute the following: “(5) An employee’s entitlement to a statutory sick leave day shall commence from their first day of employment.”.We want to establish with this amendment that the employee's entitlement to sick leave commences from their first day of employment. The Bill as drafted will adversely affect a wide range of workers, including seasonal workers and special needs assistants. We want to ensure the entitlement is available from the first day of employment. If you are sick, you are sick.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy to withdraw my amendment on the basis of the comments made by the Minister of State.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I support what Deputies O'Reilly and Paul Murphy said. This is a basic provision in employment law across Europe. The rhetoric from today's meeting is a little disappointing. I am referring to the onus on the employer. As Deputy O'Reilly quite rightly said, we have heard these arguments before in respect of wage increases, minimum wage increases, etc. Every employer group told us Armageddon would occur, but it did not happen. What we have been arguing for and trying to bring into law is a basic provision to prevent people from feeling they have to go to work when sick and so they will get paid to feed their children. These provisions are basics across Europe. Let us tilt the argument back to where it should be. It should be about protecting sick workers.

The Minister should not have to wait 12 months before improving the conditions of workers.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I respectfully disagree.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«A reality of Irish life that people often forget is that we have a low-pay economy. A total of 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. We have the third highest proportion of low-paid workers in the OECD. People in Ireland are paid poorly. We do not have the same basic state provision of GP visit care as other European countries. The two elements that make the Irish context different are the number of people who are poorly paid and the poor provision of basic public services such as GP visits. If people get sick it will cost them money. It will cost them to go to the doctor and to get whatever the doctor prescribes. It may make more sense to people to pretend they are not sick and to go to work. The Minister of State has to get into the mindset of poorly paid workers. A disproportionate number of them are women. They will have to make this choice. They may decide they cannot afford to take the dip in their wages as outlined in the Bill because of the costs they will have to incur in attending a GP and purchasing medicines. We have to have a sympathetic Act that protects workers who have to make this horrible choice so we do not have in the workforce people who feel they have to go to work when they are sick as otherwise they could not pay bills or feed their children. I ask the Minister of State to respond to this. We have a pandemic of low pay in the economy. This is a recognised fact. We also have the cost of being sick in Ireland, which is much higher than anywhere else in Europe.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«They have free GP care.
AodhanORiordan«Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We absolutely accept that this Bill will improve things. It should not be left unsaid that this is a welcome move by the Government. We are working constructively to try to improve it. However, it is a hell of a thing to worry about getting sick if you are in a low-paid job and you are genuinely terrified that you might be unwell because you cannot afford to be unwell and therefore you might hide that sickness and go to work because you cannot afford a dip in the wages or the costs that you would accrue for attending a GP. It is a hell of a thing to be that worried, looking at your children or at your bills and knowing that you just cannot afford to get sick. That is why we are bringing forward these amendments. Our fear is that this may be an underutilised provision because people just do not feel that it protects them enough so they go to work sick, hiding their sickness, pretending that they are okay, coughing in secret, telling people they are fine if they are asked, because the protections that are being brought in for them will just not work. Over a period, we may find, through the Department's analysis, that it did not work for the people that it needs to work for most. Those are the low paid, vulnerable workers in insecure work often exploited, who are disproportionately women, migrant workers and young people. We should, therefore, be trying to eliminate the fear in a household or a that person. That is why we put forward these amendments. I absolutely appreciate that employers have fears about their businesses but we live in a country with a low-pay epidemic and one which does not provide basic healthcare in terms of free GP care that other countries just take for granted. That is why we feel so strongly about these amendments.

AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«With regard to the overall discussion about the Teaching Council, there must be a mid-way point between absolute abolition and retention as it is.  Perhaps the committee could invite representatives of the Teaching Council to appear before it for a wide-ranging discussion on the way the council does its business.  The Teaching Council is currently considering matters relating to some of the requirements to become a teacher in primary education, including some of the requirements from the leaving certificate.  It might be timely, in view of this discussion, to talk to some people in the Teaching Council about its structures and its engagement with the teaching profession.  It is fair to acknowledge, as Deputy O'Sullivan has correctly pointed out, that there is a level of dissatisfaction among teachers.  Every agency of the State in this period of reform must reassert its credibility and the need for the agency.  I will propose inviting the Teaching Council to attend a meeting when we sit as the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.

(1) A person who administers to or causes to be taken by another person (‘C’) a drug or other substance—(a) knowing that C does not consent to what is being done, and(b) with intent thereby to stupefy or overpower C so as to enable himself or herself or any other person to engage in sexual activity with or involving C,is guilty of an offence.(2) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) is liable—(a) on summary conviction, to a Class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.(3) In subsection (1), ‘sexual activity’ has the meaning assigned to it by section 2 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.”.”. I thank the Minister and her officials. This amendment aims to provide for a specific offence of "spiking", that is, "administering a substance with intent". The amendment states:The Act of 1997 is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 12:“12A. (1) A person who administers to or causes to be taken by another person ... a drug or other substance—(a) knowing that ... [that person] does not consent to what is being done, and(b) with intent thereby to stupefy or overpower ... [that person] so as to enable himself or herself or any other person to engage in sexual activity with or involving ... [that person],is guilty of an offence.The Minister will be aware of this activity. People on nights out are conscious of it, and many sexual assaults and rapes occur following the action of spiking. What we intend with this amendment is to provide for a specific offence of the spiking of a substance, that is, a drink, that a person may be consuming.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her engagement. I am happy to withdraw my amendment to allow the Minister to reassess the situation and come back, certainly on the sentencing guidelines. We suggested ten years, but I suppose there is a difference between poisoning with the intent of making someone unwell and spiking with the intent of committing a sexual assault or rape, based on the fact that the person would be unconscious. I suggest there is a nuance in this regard which is separate. If an individual is trying to poison someone, trying to do them harm, that would be like a common assault in respect of trying to debilitate a person by poisoning them. Spiking a drink is an attempt to temporarily make that person lose their functions so an individual could commit a sexual assault or rape. It is a separate offence. I refer to trying to charge someone who had committed a spiking offence under poisoning legislation, which has a three-year potential penalty. I think it is a separate offence we are talking about in this case. I am happy to withdraw the amendment and to resubmit it on Report Stage, based on the Minister working with her officials and reflecting on the sentencing guidelines in this context. I again submit for her consideration, however, that there is a difference between poisoning and spiking. I know it may be subtle and the Minister may feel it is already covered, but I still contend there is a difference. As a committee and an Oireachtas, we must be quite sure that in our legislation anybody intending to spike a drink is looking at a sentence of ten years. I say this because it is more than poisoning. It is debilitating somebody's bodily functions for the intent of sexual assault or rape.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 8:In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Fees payable on declaration
3. The Act of 1956 is amended by the substitution of the following section for section 30:
“Fees payable on declaration
30. (1) Subject to subsection (2), whenever any person is by this Act required or empowered to make a declaration for the purposes of this Act, regulations made under this Act may require that such person shall pay, on the making of such declaration, such fee as may be prescribed.(2) Regulations to which subsection (1) applies shall not require the payment of a fee exceeding the maximum fee chargeable pursuant to regulations made under the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993 for the issue of a passport to a person aged 18 years or over.”.”.I do not wish to speak to the amendment at length. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's take on it.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I will withdraw with a view to resubmitting. However, it is certainly accepted that the cost involved is quite prohibitive for quite a number of people who are applying. However, on the basis of the Minister of State's response, I will withdraw for resubmission on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 155:In page 43, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:“(6) The Minister may request the Authority to prepare and submit to him or her, within the period specified in the request, a report in respect of any matter relating to policing services, and the Authority shall comply with the request.”.The purpose of this amendment is to make provision for the Minister for Justice and Equality under 620(6) to request the authority to submit to him or her a report on any matter relating to policing services. Such reports could prove useful in the context of, for example, the development of policy in relation to policing services. Having considered the wording of this amendment further, the Minister considers that requiring the authority to submit a report within the period specified is not fully appropriate in the context of the independence of the authority. Accordingly, the Minister is considering bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to modify this provision by requiring the provision of the report as soon as the authority is in a position to do so, rather than within a specified timeframe.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 156:In page 43, line 13, to delete “(6) The Minister shall” and substitute the following:“(7) The Minister shall”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 163:In page 47, line 23, to delete “and”. 
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 164:In page 47, line 25, to delete “or (5)”.” and substitute “or (5)”, and”.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I move amendment No. 165:In page 47, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:“(d) by the addition of the following subsection after subsection (6): “(7) Notwithstanding subsections (4A) and (5)—(a) the Authority may refer to the Ombudsman Commission any matter relating to policing services, and(b) the Minister may refer to the Ombudsman Commission any matter, that gives rise to a cause for concern that a member of the Garda Síochána may have done anything referred to in subsection (4) for the Commission to consider whether the matter is one that it should investigate under that subsection.”.”.The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new subsection into section 102 to enable the authority or Minister to refer matters to GSOC for consideration as to where GSOC should initiate a public interest investigation under section 102(4). Section 48 of the Bill inserts a new subsection 4(a) into section 102 which enables the authority to refer matters to GSOC for investigation. This provision replicates a similar power for the Minister to that in section 102(5).  Referral under these provisions will always result in GSOC initiating an investigation. This is appropriate where the authority or Minister is satisfied that an investigation should be initiated. However, there is no mechanism under the current provisions to deal with a situation where, for example, the authority or the Minister is uncertain as to whether an investigation is required or where GSOC might have already completed an investigation but the authority or Minister is unaware of this fact. The amendments now being proposed seek to address the situation by allowing the authority or the Minister to refer matters to GSOC on the basis that it will determine whether an investigation under section 102(4) is warranted. Amendments Nos. 163 and 164 are technical amendments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to reiterate the fact that we will table an amendment to section 44(62H) on Report Stage. I mentioned it in my previous remarks.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«While the Minister agrees with the principle behind this proposal, we are unable to accept the amendment because the provisions are already included in the Bill. I refer Deputy Mac Lochlainn to section 14(1)(c) which comprehends refusal to confiscate and which states, "that compliance with the external confiscation order in relation to the offence that resulted in the making of that order would infringe the ne bis in idem principle". It means a person cannot be tried twice for the same crime. It is often referred to as the double-jeopardy principle. In addition, subsection (1)(e) already states that "the criminal conduct concerned was either committed outside the territory of the designated state concerned or committed wholly or partly in the State". Each state only has jurisdiction over offences committed within its borders. The new section 60E.(1)(a), which deals with refusal to execute external financial penalty order, states that an order would be refused where "a financial penalty order has been made in the State against the defendant in respect of the conduct which resulted in the making of the external financial penalty order". In addition, subsection (1)(e) provides for refusal where the criminal conduct concerned was either committed outside the territory of the designated state concerned or committed wholly or partly in the State. A similar provision applies in regard to the EU-Japan mutual legal assistance agreement to which we are giving effect. Article 11, grounds for refusal, provides that assistance will be refused where "the person, who is subject to criminal investigations, prosecutions or other proceedings, including judicial proceedings, for which the assistance is requested, in the requesting State, has already been finally convicted or acquitted for the same facts in a Member State or Japan". I should also point out to the Deputy that there is already a general provision in section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 - the legislation we are amending today - which provides that the procedures in dealing with such requests may not be contrary to the fundamental principles of the laws of the State, including the principle of ne bis in idem. We have no difficulty with the thrust of the amendment but it is already catered for in this and other legislation.
AodhanORiordan«Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)«2011-03-09«None«Táim an sásta a bheith anseo i dteannta an choiste chun labhairt faoi mo phost nua. Mar is eol don coiste, táim lonnaithe sa Roinn Dlí agus Cirt agus Comhionnanais chomh maith, ag plé le cúrsaí comhionnanais agus le comhphobail nua. Tá ráiteas agam anois gur mhaith liom a léamh amach don choiste. I appreciate the opportunity today to discuss with the select sub-committee the 2015 Estimates, to outline this year's priorities for Culture Ireland and to build on the Minister's remarks on commemorations. The Department's Culture Ireland programme continues to create and support opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues. In 2014, the Culture Ireland grants programme supported more than 300 projects from all art forms, thereby enabling artists to perform in 51 countries around the world. It was a successful year for developing new audiences. Culture Ireland supported Irish artists to reach 3 million live audience members and a further 6 million television viewers. Irish artists won high-profile awards and critical recognition. They also created important platforms for other State bodies, such as Tourism Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, to gain wider benefits for Irish tourism and business interests. Culture Ireland's €2.5 million allocation for 2015 will be directed across all art forms, in line with its strategy, which is focused on strengthening Ireland's international reputation for innovation and creativity, and creating career opportunities for Irish artists globally. In addition to grant round funding and showcasing initiatives, Culture Ireland also supports Ireland's two key overseas cultural centres, the Irish Arts Center in New York and the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris. As well as maintaining important connections to the diaspora, these centres in prime cultural cities help to develop further opportunities for Irish artists. To date in 2015, Irish artists have presented work globally, from New York to Sidney, as part of the 164 events that have been awarded support so far to take place this year. The music showcasing at Celtic Connections in Glasgow, the Folk Alliance International conference in Kansas in the US, and home showcasing at TradFest in the first two months of this year have already reaped contracts for many Irish musicians. For the St. Patrick's Day period this year, Irish film festivals have been supported to take place in Boston, New York, Rome, Moscow and Sidney. Irish musicians will tour extensively in the US, Australia, China and Europe. I wish to refer to the ongoing work on commemoration of the historic events of 1916. The commemoration affords us time to interrogate the past based on hard evidence, to examine the issues in a dignified way and for communal reflection to seek to understand better the emotive forces that propelled the emergence of an independent state. Almost 100 years ago, Irish men and women, North and South, took up arms in many uniforms. The question of this island being part of an empire was one question that many sought answers to. They took that question apart in the trenches of the western front, in Gallipoli, at the Somme, in the rubble of Sackville Street, in the GPO and on Moore Street. Our memory project, in the decade of commemorations, will remember all of them. The expertise of our cultural institutions and the advice of historians, who comprise the Government's expert advisory group, will be central to our commemorations, as will the vibrancy and imagination of young people. I look forward to the continued support of Oireachtas colleagues as we develop and deliver these commemorative events.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I wish to add to what the Minister said about local authorities. In Deputy McEntee's county of Meath, there was a major event during the 1916 Rising in Ashbourne. It is important that the commemorations are not seen to be Dublin focused and that every local authority is able to commemorate the activities that took place in Easter Week 1916. There were quite a number of insurrections, small and large, throughout the country. Those best placed to commemorate them are local authorities who know the dynamics of their own areas much better. They can deal with community groups that wish to commemorate the individuals concerned and the events that occurred. As regards the Deputy's specific question, an international programme to support Irish writers is in place. In partnership with the Ireland Literature Exchange, more than 20 translations of Irish writers have been produced. We had a major presence in Edinburgh, as well as at the Toronto and Berlin book festivals.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«My amendment specifies the need for an adult learner to be on the ETBs. It states: "and the Minister shall nominate 1 man and 1 woman who are representative of students and who are registered as students in a centre for education or recognised school or are learners in an education or training facility or other facility maintained by any other public service body where the board provides education or training and have reached 18 years of age for appointment to the board." This is recommended by NALA. I would like the Minister to consider this, if not now, on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I understand where the Minister is coming from and I acknowledge the business element might be difficult to nail down but because of the education that will be provided by ETBs, the nature of the students who will attend, the nature of the further education sector and the fact that the empowerment of the student body has not necessarily always been to the forefront, it would be much easier to close that circle of empowerment by having an adult learner on the board and to make that a statutory requirement along with a requirement relating to the other representatives the Minister suggests.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The amendment speaks for itself. It proposes to insert the words "adult learners" in subsection (1)(b) on line 15. Paragraph (b) would read "to consult with the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, adult learners and employers from time to time for the purpose of determining which, or which classes of, further education and training programmes should be the subject of advances...". The purpose of the amendment is to provide that if employers are to be consulted - the Minister is obviously to be consulted - service users should also be consulted to ensure there was a full circle of engagement. If employers are to be specifically included, as they should be, surely adult learners should also be included. If we are to have an approach which is generous, open-minded and inclusive, the inclusion of adult learners should be obvious in the subsection.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am happy to withdraw my amendment on the proviso that we return to the issue before Report Stage. As Deputy O'Brien has said, I do not see why adult learners should be passive anywhere throughout the Bill. They have to be consulted and have to be an integral part of it. If we are mentioning employers in the Bill, that would imply employer organisations, adult learners and those who speak for them and those who know what is best for them, as these are integral to what we are trying to achieve and should be included. I will withdraw the amendment and await a further discussion on the matter. I appreciate the Minister of State's sentiments.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Amendments No. 34 and 37 are similar to the ones we moved in the previous section about bodies representative of adult learners and community and voluntary bodies, so hopefully their spirit will be accepted and we will return to it on Report Stage as needs be. On amendment No. 30, which I have jointly submitted with Deputy McConalogue, the service would have to "prepare and submit to the Minister a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels in accordance with section 9". The issue here with adult literacy is that 23% of the adult population of Ireland are functionally illiterate. As a Government and as a society we have to realise that fact in everything we do and every strategy we come up with, and knit into every piece of legislation that goes thorough our hands a strategy to tackle that. We cannot address this problem until we admit there is a problem. I vividly remember that when I was in opposition and there was controversy over FÁS, the current Minister - then the Labour spokesperson on education - proposed this very thing and it was not accepted by the Government. Now is the time for us to be generous again with our legislation and accept the fact that we do not have an adult literacy strategy in this country. We have an adult literacy crisis. It is not refuted by anybody that 23% of our adult population are functionally illiterate and cannot read this legislation, site notices or instructions on medicine bottles. These are very basic functions that they cannot engage with in their lives. We have consistently, over decades, failed them. Previously FÁS had no adult literacy policy, which was absolutely flabbergasting. We now have the potential to knit into this legislation the construction and submission of an adult literacy policy and this is the time for us to take up that challenge and run with it. I feel very strongly about this and I hope the Minister takes the spirit of the amendment on board and that together, across parties, we can come to terms with the challenges ahead of us and put into this legislation, finally, a strategy to combat this crisis in Irish society.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I understand the Minister's concerns. If the only way for me to advance this is to withdraw the amendment, I will do so and discuss it before Report Stage. If we do not prescribe functions in legislation, however, then they just do not happen. There was much good work done by FÁS and decent people doing a good job on the ground, but there were other services and undertakings that the agency should have been charged with that just did not happen. The very idea that the fundamental further training agency of the State did not have an adult literacy policy was just bizarre, as has been pointed out by the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA. Now that we are radically reforming the delivery of further training programmes, not to knit a provision on adult literacy into this legislation is a lost opportunity. We have to state boldly in the legislation that we have an adult literacy problem and that SOLAS will be charged with developing, preparing and submitting to the Minister a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels. That is not too much to ask. This should be a box-ticking exercise in any sort of legislation of this nature. I understand the argument that such an inclusion may be over-prescriptive, and one wants legislation to be as fluid as possible. However, this is a wonderful opportunity for us to acknowledge and tackle the crisis in adult literacy, a crisis about which no one really wants to talk. Who wants to admit that 23% of our adult population are functionally illiterate? We have to admit to this and find a solution for it. This Bill provides the opportunity to do so. The spirit of the debate around this Bill has been generous and inclusive. If the Minister can commit to us that we will return to this matter before Report Stage, I will accept the request to withdraw the amendment. However, I do not want him to underestimate how passionate I and other members feel about this issue.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«We have a way forward, which I accept. While symbolism is important, these amendments are not about symbolism. The wording of the amendment states “to prepare and submit to the Minister a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels.” That is not symbolic. That is a statement of intent and a reasonable objective. There have been plenty of tokenistic symbolic insertions into legislation in the past which have gone nowhere. I am not a fan of them as they do nothing.However, this is not symbolic, because it asks that the service prepare and submit a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy. This seems to me a reasonable objective to insert. If the Minister of State feels it cannot be done today, I will be happy to accept his suggestion that we work together on it for Report Stage. I also question the suggestion that it would be necessary to list every other one also, but we can discuss that. The Minister of State has given us a way forward and I am happy to accept that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What document is that in?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Okay. The information on page nine.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«In regard to the context and impact indicators, the number of international students in the higher education institutions increased from 25,000 in 2010 to 30,000 in 2012. Can I assume that this is a deliberate act in cross-departmental initiatives to encourage more international students to come to our higher education institutions?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Given that the intention is to double the number of students in the coming years, is there a target date?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«No.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I suppose what people find difficult to understand with regard to the universal social charge is that self-employed workers who earn over €100,000 pay 10%, yet those who are not self-employed do not. People find it difficult to understand the rationale behind the reluctance to equalise the payment for workers, whether self-employed or not. I understand that if the universal social charge was to be increased to 10%, it would raise €71 million. If that were to happen, there would be potential to lessen the burden on those on the lower end. I am interested, as I am sure are others, in hearing why that equalisation cannot take place. What is the rationale behind the Minister's thinking?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It would be beneficial if a copy of the response the Minister read out to me could be forwarded to all the members of the sub-committee. Can he confirm that the €71 million figure, which was mentioned after I asked how much would be gained if the universal social charge were increased to 10% for PAYE workers earning more than €100,000, is accurate?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«The reality is that 40% of third level students are on some level of grant, such as the maintenance grant if not a complete grant. That is a large number of students who are outside the bracket.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«What most people are not aware of is that all the receipts from betting we have go to the horse and greyhound fund.  This levy provides an opportunity to raise moneys on new forms of betting.  Other sporting organisations could benefit from this funding too rather than 100% of any bet placed on any sporting event going to the horse and greyhound fund.Although the Department of Finance always says it cannot ring-fence money for anything, not mental health or suicide prevention, legislation was passed in 2001 to achieve this for the horse and greyhound fund. Can we ensure the receipts from this new levy will not be ring-fenced for the same fund and can we have an assurance that a different arrangement will be in place? It is highly questionable that the arrangement will still be in place for this, underpinned by the legislation. Unless it is amended or repealed, there is little we can do. I am anxious for the Minister to clarify that receipts from the fund would not be ring-fenced for the horse and greyhound fund and that we would have an understanding that the funding mechanism would, perhaps, be reviewed in the future because the legislation was passed in 2001 and we live in very different times. Many different sporting organisations would be keen to impress upon the Minister and his Department that it needs to be reviewed. While I do not take away from the validity of the fantastic resource that is horse and greyhound racing, a dedicated fund for it might be said to be unusual.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«It is not a tradition.  It is legislated for.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Yes, please.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak. Everybody here could agree that we hope the legislation will not be needed, but life is not that simple.  I want to put on the record that those who propose that this section be deleted are suggesting that the constitutional rights of women, as laid down by the Supreme Court and the will of the people, be left unvindicated. They are also suggesting that a suicidal woman who would kill herself as a result of her pregnancy would have two options: she would be forced by the State to go through with that pregnancy regardless of her suicidal state, or she would be forced by the State to go to the UK without the support of her clinician, medical team and family. If we delete this section as proposed by members of the committee, they are the two options we are presenting to women who will kill themselves because of a crisis pregnancy. Those who propose deleting the section should think long and hard about that, and take into account the fact that it is the constitutional right of a woman whose life is at risk by suicide to obtain a termination on that basis. That is what the X case was all about.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am disappointed with the proceedings today, they have been pathetic. What normally happens is that there is a level of political grandstanding. That takes place on the political scene and everyone understands that there is an element of drama and theatrics. However, normally when one comes into these chambers the jackets are taken off, the sleeves are rolled up and we dig deep into the situation that the Government presents and try to find solutions and some costed alternatives. What occurred today was done purely for cameras, for notice, and for political grandstanding reasons. It is the very reason the people have turned away from a connection with the political process and the very reason the people are tired of the political system. It makes the people and those new to these Houses wonder whether we will ever get out of this mess when the best thing some people can hope to get out of today is a headline, a newspaper clip or a piece in "Oireachtas Report" of themselves walking out. There is one party that got us into this mess and another party that does not even have the sense to get its proposals costed. There is someone else who is more interested in writing newspaper columns than finding costed alternatives. It is pathetic and I am embarrassed to be sitting here today as an Irish parliamentarian.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the Minister for her presentation. My question centres on family income supplement, too, which the Minister has addressed. Another way of looking at it is that, in effect, we have spent €250 million, which has been increased to €280 million, to support approximately 50,000 families who are in work but so poorly paid that the State must intervene to keep them out of poverty. Do we need to have another conversation about what the Minister has mentioned before, a living wage? We spend a great deal of time discussing the social protection system and words such as fraud, dependency culture and so on always come into the conversation. When I dig deep into the figures, it appears that there is an element of corporate welfare, whereby the State is spending €280 million to support those in work because employers are not giving them enough hours, as the Minister said, or not paying them enough. Where do we strike the balance? How do we ensure those who are in work are paid a dignified wage and not dependent on the State? How do we strike a balance between supporting those whom we need to support, to encourage them to stay in employment and have that routine in their lives which, as the Minister said, is crucial, and talking to employers about their responsibility to lift people out of poverty, without having to depend on the goodwill of the social protection system? There is a serious conversation to be had about culture, values and dignity in the workplace.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Can the witnesses put in context the school lives that children with additional needs lead? There is a tendency to assume that everything is working well and that this July provision debate comes in an extreme circumstance, which is why we are discussing it. Can the witnesses speak to the reality experienced by parents who cannot find a school place? Can they speak to the waiting lists that are there for basic interventions that can often last as long as five years? I have documentation here from constituents of mine, one of whom has a daughter aged six who has been on the waiting list for two years for a basic intervention. She has autism and the letter from the HSE states in black and white that the waiting list for Beechpark services is five years long. Can the witnesses speak to the fact that many parents go from school to school trying to get a school place and can be and are turned down? Can the witnesses speak to the number of times the Minister has invoked his right under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to instruct a school to open a unit? Can the witnesses speak to the fact that because of the constitutional reality, the Department of Education and Skills abdicates its responsibility and puts the onus on parents to find a school place for their children and that special educational needs organisers, SENOs, hand a list of schools to parents and basically abandon them at that point? We have parents who have been to 15, 16, 17 and 18 schools looking for a school place for their children. Can the witnesses speak to the fact that parents become campaigners when they do not want to be campaigners? They need the State to defend and protect them and to care for them. What happens is that they suffer huge levels of exhaustion because at one point, one is dealing with a challenge in one's family life where someone has a diagnosis that has to be dealt with and learned about and then overnight and at the same time, one becomes a campaigner for services that are not there.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I accept that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«That is fine. I will bring it back to that context so. Given the context of the deficiency of services and of State provision for children with additional needs, how do the witnesses reflect on how these issues can be addressed in the long term in terms of the July provision and of schools returning in September?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for the presentation. My first question is about the summer programme. A principal contacted me to say that she was under the impression or she was told that the pupil-teacher ratio for the summer programme would 6:1. On that basis she encouraged four teachers from her staff to sign up to the programme, which they did. Then she got an official notification from the Department stating that the ratio would be 12:1. As a result, two of the teachers who had signed up for the programme will now no longer be able to do it. Will Mr. Tattan comment on that? Was there an official statement from the Department that it would be 6:1, and if that situation changed what was the reason? I will read a message that was sent out by a school regarding July provision. I want to get the reaction from the Department to the message that parents are getting from schools. It states: "Due to lack of guidance and support from the Department of Education and for health and safety reasons the school has decided not to participate in the summer provision programme". That came from a primary school. I was a primary school principal and when a primary school principal is engaging with the parent body, one's language is very tight. One generally does not use any type of blame, one might say. However, this is quite stark. What reaction would the Department have to such a communication from a school to a parent body? The third issue is transport for July provision. Certainly, in an urban context it might be easier to access July provision if it is school based, but it is obviously more challenging if one lives further from the facility. However, even in an urban context many people and children have to travel long distances in transport which is often provided but which I understand will not be provided in these circumstances. I ask the witnesses to respond on those three issues - the pupil-teacher ratio, the statement from the school to the parents and the issue of transport.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I am referring to the DEIS programme.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«Is it the case that at no stage should any school have been under the impression that the ratio was 6:1?
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I would like to add to what others have said. The school experience of young people is not just about dealing with teachers. We need to hear the voices of school wardens, special needs assistants, caretakers and secretaries. They are all worried about going back in September, what it will mean for them, how they are going to be trained and how they will do their jobs. I ask the representatives of the ASTI and the TUI to speak about fifth year students, particularly vulnerable fifth year students. Many members of the ASTI and the TUI are concerned that some fifth year students may not come back, particularly vulnerable ones, because of the length of time they have been out of the school system. There is no legal requirement for them to be in school after the age of 16. Are the witnesses concerned that a vulnerable generation may be lost to the school system because of Covid-19? I would like to ask the representatives of the INTO about class sizes. Is it reasonable to request that the Government suspend all teacher losses so that no school will lose a teacher over the summer, thereby allowing them to be effectively equipped to deal with the massive challenge coming in September? There seems to be an assumption on everybody's part that children and students are manageable at all times. Not every Johnny or Mary behaves at all times. That should be stressed. We must discuss how discipline issues might be dealt with in a socially distanced environment if a child is a danger to themselves or others. Is it not the case that if the Minister intends to restrict access to education or to school by any enrolled students, she has to refer to section 25 of the Education Act 1998 and must consult patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions?Have the witnesses had any contact from the newly-appointed Minister about regulations that will have to issue under section 25 of the Education Act, 1998? Do we not need a multimillion euro cash and resources package to reopen our schools in September? The schools need to be staffed, cleaned, sanitised and run. Other areas of society and the economy will receive justifiable and welcome financial packages. Is it not reasonable that education will also get a sizeable package, commensurate with the impact that education has in Irish life, particularly on young lives? We need more than a statement such as the one issued yesterday by the Department. Money is going to matter when students go back to school in September. As others have said, we are working together to try to achieve that.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I have two main questions, the first of which relates to second level and is something that I raise as often as possible. School principals of disadvantaged schools say that they are concerned about a lost generation of young people who are now over 16 years of age, have no legal requirement to be in school and, therefore, might not return in September. They are young people whom schools have worked hard to keep in the system, but they have now been out of the system for approximately four months. There is a worry that there has been no recognition of how dangerous a situation we are facing in terms of a cohort of vulnerable young people who will not return in September. Will the witnesses speak about what we can do to help? Second, we have constantly stated our position that, without a major financial package that includes funding for staff, schools cannot open in September. As the witnesses know, we have overcrowded and underfunded schools. There is a suspicion or fear that some of the actual costs will fall on school management bodies, principals and the fundraising capacity of schools, which would not be fair at all. In terms of staffing and potentially bringing retired teachers back into the classroom, do the witnesses agree that a major financial package is needed, and should it have happened by now, in order to ensure that the pupil-teacher ratios in primary and secondary school classrooms are reduced? What is lost in all of this is that, the first time many teachers stand in front of a class, they are worried about being able to control and manage the class. In a situation where there is social distancing, how can a teacher do that effectively? Those are my two questions, that is, on the vulnerability of those who might not return to the system and what the witnesses believe the political system can do to address that, as well as on the staffing that will be needed in September. Young people returning in September will have been out of the system for more than five months. I know from my own experience that dealing with a child who has been out of the system for two months is a challenge, and that is without there being a pandemic or social distancing considerations. I would appreciate it if the witnesses spoke to these two questions.
AodhanORiordan«Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin«2011-03-09«None«I want to ask in particular about the financial package that will be available for the reopening of schools. Will it include post-primary further education colleges, which come under Mr. Ó Foghlú's remit and have a roll number as schools? I will ask my questions in a block if that is okay. Will the financial measures address the digital divide? I am told that approximately 30% of students in the post-primary and further education sectors have no IT connectivity at all. I know from talking to some principals from disadvantaged second level schools that approximately 60% of their students have to access learning via a phone device. Will that be addressed in the financial package? With regard to teaching and teacher numbers, will all teacher absences be substitutable? Does Mr. Ó Foghlú accept that in a primary school setting, if a teacher is absent in the new scenario we are facing, and without a substitute being immediately available, it would be impossible for that class to be supervised, taught or split into another class, and so without that substitute, the system cannot survive? Will all teacher absences be substitutable, and within that, will jobsharing teachers be able to provide cover? Is that part of the solution? My last question is on predicted gradings and the fact that the leaving certificate was cancelled due to Covid-19. A high-profile case concerned Finn Robertson in County Waterford. While I do not ask Mr. Ó Foghlú to refer to a particular case, what is the Department doing to address the fact that some students are not eligible for predicted grades because they had been self-taught? This was flagged immediately with Mr. Ó Foghlú's Department and with the then Minister when the predicted grading system was announced. There are students who, because of various different circumstances in their own schools, take higher level or whatever level subjects themselves, are now suddenly being told they are not eligible for predicted grades. Will Mr. Ó Foghlú also answer that question please?
