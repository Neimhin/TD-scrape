CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would like clarification on what the Comptroller and Auditor General just said regarding the correspondence from the principal officer at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Is he saying the Department is in compliance, which is why we will see much of this type of correspondence coming to the committee, because it is a requirement for the Departments?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all of the witnesses and thank them for their attendance and for their ongoing co-operation with the various Oireachtas committees, which is greatly appreciated. I also thank all of the staff of the HSE and the Department of Health for their efforts in the fight against Covid-19. I wish to take up some of the points made earlier on costs. The breakdown of the 550 nursing homes involved is that 80% are private and 20% are public. Of the millions of euro that are spent, is there a disparity between the care and ancillary costs for people in public nursing homes as opposed to private homes? I refer to care, equipment and activities. Are those costs covered if a person is in a public nursing home as opposed to a private one? My understanding is that all of the ancillary costs in private nursing homes are paid for by residents or their families.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is Ms O'Connor saying that the value for money group is going to examine that issue, along with other issues in terms of the disbursement of the NTPF money? I invite Dr. O'Reardon to come in on this as well. Nursing Homes Ireland has called for an independent appeals mechanism to be introduced within the fair deal negotiation process. Is that going to be considered by the value for money group?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did Dr. O'Reardon say that the review has been completed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In regard to the expenditure of €969 million, Dr. O'Reardon indicated that, with 24,000 residents this year, that figure would hit more than €1 billion. I acknowledge the comments by the HSE witnesses regarding the 80:20 split as between public versus private provision. In terms of agency staff costs for the HSE, there seems to be an inequality - if one wants to call it that; disparity might be a better word - between public and private nursing homes. I hope that will be addressed within the work of the value for money group or in any of the other reports that are being done. There is a perceived inequality in this area and that needs to be addressed. Certainly, in terms of the staffing costs detailed in the report of the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the sheer volume of agency staff being used needs to be addressed because it is going to drag up those costs. Ultimately, the public is paying for it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have had dealings with this group. A considerable amount of money would possibly be left over, according to this correspondence, whether that proves to be the case or not. I support the call to bring them in. I believe it is important for the committee and particularly for those who are potentially eligible for this fund that we ensure people who apply are in receipt of what they are entitled to. As I said, I have already come across problems myself, and I think it is appropriate to bring them in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are two issues. One is the request for the Department to come in, which I support. That is essential. Conflated with that is the Standing Order we have inherited. Perhaps the Chair could see if that could be addressed for the next meeting in private session. Clearly, the Standing Order needs to be tweaked because it does not meet the requirements of the committee. For me, as a new Deputy to this committee, I would certainly hope that we would have a much broader remit but this seems to put shackles on that. Whatever we can do within and recognising the current judgment, we cannot be hamstrung by this. On Deputy MacSharry's point with regard to looking retrospectively at previous accounts only, it does not make sense. If there is something current and in the public interest, we should be able to amend our work programme, bring them in, whoever they are, and ask them the pertinent questions. I do not think we should deviate from that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman.I wish to make two points. This touches on our discussion of Standing Order 218 and its implications. I know that Standing Order 218 is interlinked with Standing Order 93. I would like to direct this question to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Would we be able to bring the new Department with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science before the committee? There are no previous accounts to look at because it is a brand new Department. What would happen if we were to apply the Kerins ruling to that? Moreover, I recommend including the Property Registration Authority in the work programme as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I made a suggestion to another committee I am on. Perhaps this is something for committee Chairs to decide. If the Committee of Public Accounts could hold an online hearing, it would negate the need for the two-hour limit. If members and witnesses were here in the complex, they would be covered by privilege. If witnesses were to join the committee from another room on the Oireachtas campus, a committee room would not have to be available. Perhaps the clerk could see if that is feasible. I am assuming everybody would be on site, including witnesses. If members or witnesses were not on site, they would know that qualified privilege would apply to them. This might allow us to do a lot more work more quickly. Considering the work programme in front of us, we need to be a bit innovative in how we do our own work to ensure we get the maximum amount of time with witnesses over the next several months. Perhaps the Chair could explore that with the clerk on our behalf.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to follow on from what Deputy Munster was saying about the two-hour limit. I return to my original point about the online session and I take on board what Deputy Carthy said about the limitations for the Chair and the clerk to the committee. It could be possible, although it is not ideal, but it would allow us to have an extended period where the meeting was chaired from a committee room, for example. Whichever room it was would need to be a little smaller than this room. If the rest of us were online and the witnesses were as well, there could be a short break to change venue and room. Even one of the meeting rooms would be sufficient. I am simplifying it but once one has a computer, and one is on the complex, one could continue to chair that session and we could have a four-hour session. I ask the clerk to the committee and the Chair that we would be as imaginative as possible to ensure we can get as long as possible with as many witnesses as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending. I understand that €4.5 billion is already secured and realised through the organisation. Credit is due to the work on that. There is a projection that €4 billion is to be realised between 2019 and the end of the organisation's role, as it were. Is that still on track?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Comptroller and Auditor General's report says there was a large number of high-risk, equity-backed loans, which had no property or collateral. This relates to Project Nantes, which NAMA acquired from participating banks for a nominal amount of €1 per loan. Most other loans were property-backed and related to properties in the US and across Europe. With regard to that portfolio, I understand Project Nantes was one of the first portfolios the witness dealt with under NAMA. From his earlier comments and the question regarding an individual who was involved both on the negotiating side and ultimately in one of the purchasing entities, I believe he said that the amount was mooted around October 2011 but he did not start until, perhaps, November or the like.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the negotiations were continuing. It states that it went on to agree adjustments. Basically, it was not finalised and was continuing. How long did that process continue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did the price change from that originally mooted in October through to December?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously, the concern of the committee is not only the connection with that individual, which I heard the witness say he regrets, and it would have been better if it had been made known in advance of all this, but also the losses that materialised at the end of the day. We want to see the full value realised on behalf of the taxpayer. I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General. His report states that "without the assurance of a contemporaneous asset valuation and a competitive sales process, there is no basis to conclude that NAMA achieved the best possible financial outturn from the Project Nantes loan sale". What was missing in his investigations that means he cannot make a full definitive evaluation in terms of any impropriety, if one can call it that? His report also states that since Project Nantes involved a loan sale, "there is no reason to believe that there was any infringement of section 172 of the NAMA Act". How did he come to that conclusion?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Which is it - a competitive process or if there was more information available to him?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have two quick questions. In terms of the lands and sites NAMA currently has to dispose of before 2025 or thereabouts and previous land it has sold, has NAMA kept the full planning permissions attached to those sites active or did it let them lapse? If so, roughly how many are we talking about? I would have hoped and expected that extensions to planning permissions would have been applied for to keep the value on the sites. Finally, if we find there are breaches of section 172, will enforcement action and pursuit of those issues be taken?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Following on from our previous meeting, was any consideration given to the committee potentially meeting online, even if only to deal with correspondence? I understand what the Chairman is saying with regard to the schedule every second week but has there been any update on the possibility of online meetings?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have no problem with that but we should consider it as an option, depending on how much work we get done. I would not close the door on it completely and would keep it under consideration. As I said on the previous occasion, I do not want the committee to be held back by the two-hour restriction. If we can get other work done online, even business that does not involve witnesses, such as the meeting the Chairman spoke about regarding the work of the committee, it would be a great help.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I offer apologies for my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe. I thank the witnesses for attending. I appreciate it. I am aware they appeared before this committee in June 2018 to deal with the financial statements from 2016 regarding the nursing homes support scheme. I will mention some of the recommendations as a result of that meeting. Recommendation 1 states:It is not clear that the cost of care in public nursing homes is providing value for money to the taxpayer. Of a budget in the region of €1 billion for the Nursing Home Support Scheme, approximately two thirds is expended on public nursing homes that provide one fifth of capacity.The Department of Health commenced a value for money review, which I note has been referred to earlier. That was concluded in May 2019. How soon do the witnesses think that is going to be published? Do they have any more information for the members of the committee? It appears to be dragging its heels. Indeed, that issue is still live and relevant since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee. Recommendation 2 states, "The National Treatment Purchase Fund’s review of its pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes is ongoing." It also refers to increasing the transparency of the current price mechanism and continuing to ensure value for money for the taxpayer. Again, something similar is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report today, regarding the lack of review of charges. If I understood the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks, just two reviews were conducted by the chief executive. I am open to correction on that, but he might clarify why that is the case. In terms of the internal appeals process, what changes have been made to those since the witnesses' last appearance before the committee?Transparency about negotiations with nursing homes and how fair deal agreements are arrived at with individual homes is in question. We need to ensure that funding is based on the need of those who are in care and not necessarily whether they are in a public or private home. What changes can the NTPF assure us it has made in the intervening period and what changes does it intend to make now that, in light of Tuesday's budget, the funding has changed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Sloyan. We have limited time. Regarding the transparency of internal reviews and the appeals process, what changes have been made since the NTPF was previously before the Committee of Public Accounts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee. In his opening statement, Mr. Watt referred to a three-year strategy that he hoped would be introduced and implemented shortly. He might let us know what particular areas that will focus on. He mentioned the OPW and properties in its charge, in particular those under the Department of Justice and Equality. What are the proposals for the Garda stations that recently closed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Watt.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The issue arising in regard to any public body that the committee wishes to bring lies is one aspect. Is there a weekly meeting of committee chairpersons and, if so, could this matter be discussed at that forum as well? I note from the Ceann Comhairle's correspondence to the committee that another issue has arisen, I presume, because of Standing Order 218. It appears certain committees feel that the Committee of Public Accounts should not be inviting in certain bodies that it is within its remit or purview to interview. Have the committee chairpersons discussed this matter? I accept the proposal regarding this committee making a suggestion about Standing Orders but perhaps a representative of this committee should present to the Committee on Procedure on the issue. There seem to be a few unintended consequences arising in regard to the Standing Orders, which present serious issues for this committee going forward and we should try to tease out the matter a little more. I am conscious that correspondence is going to take a long time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to the witnesses for attending and for the information they have provided. I wish to ask three specific questions. The first relates to the insurance compensation fund. A repayment of €80 million was made to the Exchequer and to the fund in 2019. This will reduce outstanding balance to €555.7 million as of 31 December this year. When is that balance due to be repaid? Were any amounts received this year? My second question relates to the financial accounts for 2019. I have before me section 11 of the financial statements. My question relates to the State savings schemes. The figures show a comparison between 2018 and 2019. I gather that the Department will not have figures for 2020 yet but I assume there will be an increase this year in terms of investment in those schemes. Can the officials elaborate on that? My third question relates to the statements for current non-voted expenditure. One thing that caught my eye was the sugar levy. There is an amount for 2018 but nothing for 2019. Why is that? Will the officials come back to me on those questions, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It relates to non-voted expenditure and sugar levies. I note that there is an amount for 2018 but nothing for 2019. Why is that? It is in statement 1.6, which deals with non-voted expenditure.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is no problem. My final question relates to the appearance of officials before the committee last May. There was a recommendation from the committee about insufficient progress being made on the PULSE system. Work was due to be completed by 2020. I realise the officials might not have the information at the committee today, but perhaps they can come back to me on that. I understand clear timelines were agreed by the Central Statistics Office and An Garda Síochána. I would be interested in anything the Department has on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is perfect.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Returning to the accounts and the capital receipts from the European Union, there is a differential between the figure for 2018 and 2019 for the European Regional Development Fund. I am sure there is a reason for that, which the witnesses can come back to me with if they do not know it today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, in particular in regard to those projects that we discussed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Buckley and his colleagues. I thank them for their opening remarks and for all of their work on our important national monuments, public parks and State buildings. I thank Mr. Buckley and his colleagues for a recent update vis-à-vis a parliamentary question which I raised in July about Tully Church and the monuments surrounding it. I thank the witnesses for that briefing and for the commitment of those actively involved with the Tully site in the Cherrywood strategic development zone. The witnesses might pass on my appreciation to the officials concerned, particularly those on the ground. I have some questions relating to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the witnesses' opening remarks. The OPW leases the office premises in Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street, mainly to accommodate the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That contracted annual rent is approximately €10 million and the total commitment is €231.7 million over 25 years. It is reported that there has been an overpayment in the region of €10 million to the landlord. I know there has been ongoing correspondence between the OPW and the landlord. Will the witnesses provide this committee with an update on the lease and what engagement they have had with the landlord since their appearance at the Committee of Public Accounts in October 2018?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously €10 million is a lot of money and there is significant concern. I read the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017 and I understand the issues with the international property measurement standards, IPMS, and the difference of measurement which caused the problem. Nonetheless, the Exchequer is out to the tune of €10 million. Hopefully that will be resolved soon. Will the witnesses keep the committee apprised of developments? I turn to subhead B.7, for property maintenance which is approximately €64.7 million, an increase of €4 million from 2018, when it was €60.7 million. I am harking back quite a bit, to 2013, but the question relates to the current day. Some 100 Garda stations were closed between 2012 and 2013. Are all of those stations still under the control of the OPW?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Bourke might also tell us how many of those 100 have been sold. How many have been repurposed or are still under the OPW's control and effectively vacant?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Bourke have the cost of the ongoing maintenance of the stations still in the control of the OPW? I think a cost was given in my constituency. The cost for the maintenance of the Garda station in Dalkey was €40,796 since it was closed in 2012. Does that include the security contract for that station and similar stations?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Bourke's comments about 12 being in use for serving or retired members of An Garda Síochána. Maybe that could be considered for those remaining in OPW control. I turn to office accommodation. The OPW has a substantial portfolio of accommodation, with total leasing commitments for 2019 of €113 million. What is the total area of the office accommodation portfolio and how much is inactive at present? I note from the report that it is about 1% here in Ireland but it is up to 11% for European counterparts. Is that still the current status?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about post Covid?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume the OPW is examining, on an ongoing basis, the State's portfolio. Is there a strategy to manage it post Covid? We do not know the impact. A major bank gave an indication today about its use of office space. There will be a knock-on effect from remote working. Is that actively under consideration by the OPW?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a question on the figures given by Mr. Martin Bourke. Does the OPW have a general ratio between Dublin and outside of Dublin in terms of office space? Is there a breakdown of that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is a key question for the post-Covid period. Could the State be left with a considerable excess of office space post-pandemic? Is there a strategy to deal with that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to return to the Garda element of the portfolio. I note the lease will expire for Garda headquarters on Harcourt Street in 2022.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, it is Harcourt Square. How long is that lease for? What is the cost per annum?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I assumed from the report that it was in the ownership of the State. I would hope, given the new lease options post-2022, that would be something we could explore. It is a colossal amount of money. I agree that it is a strategic building and it is important in size, but surely the State could explore that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Bourke might come back to me on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, I will turn to flood alleviation. The OPW officials have given a good deal of information in the opening remarks. I understand the expenditure prior to 2015 was €412 million. Am I correct in saying that from 2015 to 2019 the expenditure was €268 million? What was the reason for the difference? I would have thought expenditure was ramping up at that point.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a cumulative figure. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That makes more sense. A study of 300 communities has been taking place across Ireland and 80% of the studies have been completed. What is the status of the remaining 20%? A total of 11 major flood relief schemes have commenced and seven more are due to commence shortly. Can the OPW give an indication of when those seven will be commenced? What stage are they at? If the officials do not have the information today, they might come back to me on it. I have a question specifically around the Deansgrange flood relief scheme. It is of particular interest to me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to the officials.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance here today and for their remarks. How many people are employed with the local employment service nationally?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has that increased over the intervening years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good. On that basis, is that with a view to expanding the local employment service, LES, and winding down JobPath? Are both needed in tandem with each other?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is welcome and I am glad to hear what Mr. McKeon has said about the LES because certainly it has done tremendous work over the years. It has faced many crises and dealt with a large volume of unemployment over many years. With regard to the process in which a jobseeker is referred to the LES or JobPath, how is it decided and who is decided by?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Specifically, is it the same individual in the Department who decides whether I go to JobPath or the local employment service? What are the criteria? I know Mr. McKeon has said it is random but surely there should be some sort of criteria internally, I hope there is, to decide how many people go to one or the other. The reason I ask is because there is obviously a cost. The State is paying for JobPath and, therefore, I presume the Department needs to keep the figures up. Is it true there is a penalty clause if there are not enough clients coming to JobPath? Is there a penalty for the State and the Exchequer if this is the case? Surely with the local employment service there is no such thing. What is the cost the Department faces if a certain number of jobseekers are not referred to JobPath?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So that I am clear, is Mr. McKeon saying in the first four and a half years of JobPath, the Department had a target to hit as part of the agreement between the Department and JobPath? What was that target? Mr. McKeon said it was exceeded.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If we had not met that figure what would have been the consequence for the Department? Was there a financial clause?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Up to this point there has been a big concern, and Mr. McKeon has put that to rest this morning by telling the committee there will be investment in the local employment service. Until this point, there has been a feeling in the local employment service that perhaps it would be a sacrificial lamb in all of this, and that because of a contract jobseekers were being referred to JobPath rather than the existing employment service. Mr. McKeon said approximately 280,000 jobseekers have been referred to JobPath. How many were referred to the local employment service in the same period?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Considerably fewer.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Going back to my original point about the individuals deciding who goes where, obviously there was a financial incentive for the Department to refer people to JobPath instead of the existing service. Who decides this? What are the criteria they use?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I get that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From my knowledge, there is certainly capacity in the local employment service and I hope it will be utilised. From the Department's perspective, what is the cost of the referral of a jobseeker to JobPath versus the local employment service? Can it be drilled down to that level?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. McKeon have approximate figures?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Per jobseeker?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McKeon for all that. I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If they could be sent on, I would appreciate it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My question is similar to Deputy Carthy's on the transfer of information and any subsequent questions this committee or another body may have after the winding-up of Caranua. I have a few points to raise. One is about the date on which Caranua is to appear before the committee. With regard to our earlier conversation about the national children's hospital, there is a date earlier in December we might utilise. I note that, in its correspondence, Caranua says that all survivors' applications will be completed by 11 December. Depending on when the legislation the Comptroller and Auditor General has mentioned, which is required to wind up Caranua, is to be enacted, we may need to get the organisation in as quickly as possible. The Comptroller and Auditor General may be able to answer a question for me. There is an estimated operational wind-down cost of €300,000 as of the end of October. Is there anything to suggest that cost would increase given that it is now to wind down at the end of the year? Is he familiar with that matter?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. I suggest that we use that date in early December, if it is available, to bring in Caranua.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If we put school transport on our work programme, what happens to the correspondence? Do we note it and it gets published? What do we do in that instance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can we hold it off until the next meeting?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, can we go back to the proposals for 9 December? Noting what the Comptroller and Auditor General has just said about Vote 21 and chapter 7 being taken together, presumably, Vote 24 would be taken on the Wednesday and we would deal with the other element of that on the Thursday. Can the Chairman clarify for me if the Department of Justice will be in attendance for both days, as well as the Irish Prison Service? I am conscious that there will be a cross-over in terms of some questions. We do not want to have to say at that meeting that a particular question was for yesterday's session and that today's session is only questions for the Irish Prison Service. We need to be careful of that with the new format we are proposing. As long as both agencies will be present-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, but there may be other examples where we may need to be conscious of that format.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. It works.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance today and for their responses. Many of the questions around Brexit have been asked and answered. At the outset, I wish to thank the Revenue Commissioners for the work which they have done, particularly in recent months. I mention the speed and agility with which it has responded. Mr. Cody has commented on the ICT abilities of the organisation and that certainly was not in doubt, particularly for us as public representatives who deal with the Revenue with such a volume of queries. I have been amazed by the measures taken with staff. Mr. Cody says that 5,000 of Revenue's employees are working from home and putting that in train alone is quite remarkable. I want to put on record that it is appreciated. Everybody has worked at lightning speed. I forget what phrase Mr. Cody used for it but it is true that the organisation has responded exceptionally well to this crisis. I refer to the TWSS, the EWSS and the CRSS, particularly in relation to SMEs and the self-employed. Great flexibility has been shown to those who are employees of organisations and those deadlines have been pushed out. I ask for forbearance or flexibility around the SMEs and the self-employed, given the circumstances in which they find themselves, particularly in recent weeks with level 5. It is important because the deadline is 10 December and I ask the Revenue Commissioners to show a bit of flexibility there. The witnesses might comment on whether the Revenue has given consideration to such a move. Those in that sector, both the self-employed and SMEs, would face a 5% liability on their 2019 returns. Given everything that has gone on, particularly in those sectors, it would be a good move to show a bit of flexibility. The witnesses might come back to me on my second question, which is on the ports. Mr. Cody mentioned Dublin Port in particular in his opening remarks and the preparedness of the State in the face of Brexit. On the volume of seizures that have taken place across the State - Mr. Cody mentioned the amount of contraband that has been confiscated and seized - can he give us an indication of how much of an increase that has been on the 2019 figures and on what additional resources have been put in place for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Mr. Cody to come back to me, particularly on the seizures at the ports and he might also include the VAT MOSS scheme. I note the Comptroller and Auditor General said there was a year-on-year increase since 2015 on those filings. Mr. Cody might include some more information on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Cathaoirleach and our witnesses for the presentation and Mr. Doyle, in particular, for his opening remarks. I welcome him to the Department and to the Committee of Public Accounts. Today is a great introduction for him. I will start by sincerely thanking all of the staff of local authorities and, in particular, direct labour for their great assistance during this pandemic. Mr. Doyle’s opening remarks alluded to it but from the Community Call all the way through to the library services and the outreach services, local authorities were to the fore and acted in an exemplary manner. I pass on my appreciation and that of my party to everyone concerned. The opening remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the €3.9 billion expenditure of our witnesses' Department. Am I correct in saying €2.5 billion of this was spent on housing? My initial questions are on housing, and I have a number of them. I think I heard Ms Hurley mention that in 2019 there were 20,809 homes in pre-development stage, or it may have been Ms Ryan who said that earlier on. As to those nearly 21,000 homes at pre-development stage, under what kind of schemes are those homes being developed under? Can I get a snapshot of those, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the make up of those units. I am sorry Ms Ryan for interrupting but I am limited in time. Can she forward a copy of that report to the committee? It would be much appreciated. As to the make up of those units, are they direct builds, Part 8s, or capital assistance scheme, CAS, types?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of the 14,000 units, which is nearly half coming through local authority building, which is an important point to make-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine, I understand. The housing adaption funding is essential. I represent Dún Laoghaire which has an older population. A large proportion of our tenants require adaptions to the housing. I am conscious of the time so can Ms Ryan come back to me on the funding that is proposed for 2021 for local authorities under that heading? CAS, historically, has been slow in advancing projects but what is the bulk of funding that is going to CAS for 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that the Department might come back to me on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was said that the Local Government Fund was €473 million for 2019, according to the accounts. That is down on the 2018 figure. Perhaps Mr. Doyle might provide us with an explanation on that figure because we might have expected a bounce on that. This not necessarily question for the Department, but the local authorities must have notified the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September annually of the decision of the local authority members. That is out of sync or kilter with their own budgets and is something that needs to be addressed. It was said that An Bord Pleanála collected €18.5 million. Was that in fees or was that an overall figure? As to local authority fines that are issued, whether for littering, rent arrears, parking or whatever, do they go to the central Exchequer, into the Department, or do these stay with the local authorities? Can the Department come back to me with these replies, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doyle and appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance. I will return to an issue my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, raised. I refer to HAP and homeless HAP in particular. Some applicants who have been approved for HAP have had their payment reduced if they accepted a property with a particular approved housing body, AHB. In a recent incident, a single individual had been approved for the full amount and just by virtue of the AHB they were approved to be housed with, their payment was to be reduced. I do not know how that would happen. I do not expect the witnesses to know the intricacies of these issues, but is there a policy or a mechanism within the Department whereby one gets a reduced homeless HAP for certain AHBs? I would have thought it was standard right across the board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is what I would have thought. I am flushing that out because the Comptroller and Auditor General's report delves deeply into HAP expenditure. I would like to ensure there is no differential, particularly for people who are homeless. The assistance of the State must be there to ensure they have a roof over their heads. It took quite a bit of effort to get to the bottom of this case and the anxiety caused to the individual concerned is unacceptable. I might submit further correspondence to the Department to try to deal with that issue. Deputy Verona Murphy alluded to the pyrite remediation scheme. I ask the witnesses to advise the committee on the progress made between the Housing Agency and HomeBond. I heard what the Chairman said about the previous Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas committee on housing dealing with this issue. I ask the witnesses to update the committee on that work. The report makes note of the non-pyrite related damage. I am not referring to the damage identified when dealing with the pyrite issue, but properties constructed in the last decade or two, or even three, where there are general defects. What remediation policies or procedures are there for the Department to deal with those individuals?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there any timeframe on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Claimed so far or is there-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are there remediation schemes for non-pyrite properties with general defects that have come to the attention of the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has money been allocated within the Department for 2021 to deal with those properties?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That only deals with those particular ones. Is there a fund generally for properties to which Ms Neary has not alluded?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the pyrite remediation scheme, I refer to recommendation 13 on page 232 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019: "The Board and Agency should put in place a robust process to quantify the cost of remediating non-pyrite related damage." Has that been initiated yet and what stage is that particular recommendation at?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor for that. On those non-pyrite related problems and with reference to what Ms Neary said in reply to my previous question, where another problem is identified with a property or properties, is an application made to the Minister or the Department under section 13 to have it included in the remediation scheme?How is that done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The scheme covers the period 1997 to 2013. There were 31 applications made for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown up to the end of 2019. The witnesses might come back to me on those applications. That information would be of interest to me. On the land aggregation scheme, how many sites are we talking about in total? The report refers to 47 sites that were transferred. I am sure there are more sites than that. Further on, the report states that 36 sites have gone to approval stage, that these sites comprise 159 ha, and that approximately 3,370 homes are earmarked for those sites. It also states that there are 37 sites, comprising 89 ha, that are not suitable for development. How many sites have come under that scheme, how many of them are in Dublin, and how many of them have plans approved under, say, Part 8? I am speaking in this regard not about plans in the pipeline but plans approved. Also, how many of the sites have been built on since 2010?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There were refinanced. Is that done for the purpose of the balance sheet of the local authority?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How many are in Dublin? Mr. O'Connor might come back to me on the 37 sites that are not suitable.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for his statement. I accept his apology to the committee and I thank him for it. There is no doubt, however, that the tweet was hurtful and that it was a glorification of what happened at Narrow Water. The Chairman's words from when we started our work ring true, namely, that we need to leave party politics at the door. We are here on behalf of the Oireachtas to scrutinise public bodies and other bodies. That said, I accept his apology. I do not think this is the place to scrutinise the tweet. That is for the Dáil Chamber and it is for the Chairman and his party to reflect on whether they want to deal with the matter in that forum. I would not classify the tweet as clumsy. I do not say the Chairman did so. I hope that when he says he apologises for the tweet, it will not happen again. That is an important element because, as he rightly points out, this is a very prestigious committee within the Houses and there is an extra onus on him, as Chair. I know he accepts that and I know he understands it now.I hope, however, that we will not have this situation in respect of the Chairman again because it puts the committee into disrepute and it is something we do not want to see again. I thank the Chairman for his statement.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about the delay in the 2018 accounts. Is there a particular reason for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we can take up with them when they are here.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The delay was on the Department's end.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I suggest we do that. It might help when Caranua is here for us to have been aware of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is similar to the question I raised the previous time we were discussing this issue. I note in the correspondence a reference to the passage of the residential institutions statutory fund (distribution) Bill. I am not sure at what stage that is at or when to expect it in the House. However, I note they say it will not impact on the operational process of Caranua. Ultimately, our question to the Comptroller and Auditor General at the previous meeting was about the remaining funds for distribution and what happens there. It is going to form a part of our discussion with them when they are before us. If they can, through the clerk, furnish as much information as possible in advance of that, it would assist in our process of questioning.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am proposing that a number of organisations be invited to come in and I will email them to the clerk directly but I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for his information on a number of organisations on the list of organisations he provided to the committee. Could he give a brief explainer on the local loans fund and the heritage fund, because depending on his answer it might be of interest to us to put them on the work programme. Others are the sundry moneys deposit account and the State property miscellaneous deposits account. I was unsure about the basis of NSCDA Operations Limited. A final one is the hepatitis C accounts. I can see that a number of those are still in operation. Are they still operational accounts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Who manages that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, the State property miscellaneous deposits account.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be very helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy for that. Any explanation on some of these funds would be helpful. For our own purposes it would be interesting to link them to the Departments or organisations they are part of because when they are before us we can ask questions on that. I will correspond with the clerk on this but the other items are the National Council for Special Education and the National Disability Authority. I do not know if they have been before the committee in the recent past but the clerk might liaise on that.  I am not sure whether the residential institutions redress special account falls under the Department of Finance or-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. The others are the Medical Council, the Secret Service, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the Pensions Authority, the Trade and Business Development Body and Waterways Ireland. I will email those to the clerk.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. I note Ms McPhillips in her opening remarks stated that the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, had collected €1.6 million under the proceeds or crime legislation and €2 million in Revenue seizures, and assets of €64.9 million were frozen in 2019, €53 million from crypto-currency, compared to €8.4 million in 2018. Have there been specific new targets from CAB from 2018 to 2019? It appears all these figures have increased. Ms McPhillips might give the committee more information on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms McPhillips said there were 31 cases in 2019. Is that the largest to date brought forward by CAB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would like to focus on two other items. In the Appropriation Accounts there are a number of headings detailing different programmes from Ms McPhillips's Department. When she is corresponding with the committee, I would appreciate if she could give us more information on each of those. It is those mainly where there are significant variations. If Ms McPhillips could detail those because we would like to know more about many of those schemes and projects. Also, one of the briefing documents states that the Department is compliant with the exception of 22 contracts to a value of €5.7 million. It also states these contracts are considered non-competitive and non-compliant as they were extended beyond the original contract date without a new competitive process, the details of which are as follows: four contracts with a value of €1.06 million; 16 contracts with a value of €4.08 million; and two contracts with a value of €558,000. What happened in those instances?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about the other four?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that tranche of contracts something that would recur annually because the Department is waiting on the new framework? Is that more or less how that happens?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No. Obviously, not.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would hope there are procedures in place to try to minimise that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a sizeably amount of money and it has been flagged. Regarding the justice and policing transformation programme, I note there was an estimation provision of €10 million and only €6.1 million was spent. Can Ms McPhillips elaborate on why that was underspent?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is a considerable underspend under crime prevention measures. A estimated provision of €1.19 million was due to be spent for 2019 but the outturn was €411,000. What was the discrepancy there? Why was the full budget not spent?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The intention was to spend that provision. Spending under that category would impact many communities across the country.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. Are the visiting committees still operational?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How often do they visit the prisons?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Why is it the case that the last report I could find from the Irish Prison Service was from 2014? Are there not more up-to-date reports?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Why is there such a backlog of reports?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The last one I found was from 2014 and it would have been helpful today to have those. I would like the witnesses to revert on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They may be published but they are not on the Irish Prison Service website. The two organisations might revert on that. I thank the witnesses for that. Figures were given for the number of prisoners currently in custody, which is 3,971, and it was also mentioned that there were 8,939 committals. How many prisoners are on remand versus committed by the courts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Basically, on those figures, what is the number of prisoners who are typically in a cell?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witness for the figures. How many cells, in percentage terms, are overcrowded?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It would not be classified as overcrowded.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are the three-person cells overcrowded according to international standards?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his report. Chapter 7.11 relates to catering, indicating €5.66 as the average cost of a meal in 2009. Depending on age and gender, I presume, there are considerations of the volume of food needed. It specifically states that in the Portlaoise prisons, some prisoners have extra menu options available by long-standing arrangement, including historical and political reasons. Why does this apply to only some prisoners and those in Portlaoise? Why are the extra options not available to the rest of the cohort?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would the mess committee cover the E block in Portlaoise?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. Is it purely because these prisoners are accommodated in the E block and the reason they are being detained that these prisoners get extra options?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In other prisons, including Mountjoy, are there any additional options for prisoners? What I am trying to decipher is whether a prisoner is better off being accommodated in some prisons? Ideally, a person would not need to be accommodated in any prison but would a prisoner be better off in terms of catering facilities in some prisons? Are some prisoners treated better than others?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I get that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about the menu?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. Perhaps the Irish Prison Service will update us on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could the relevant authority, maybe the Irish Prison Service, revert to me with the method by which the prisoner welfare accounts are distributed. I understand there was a reference to the governor. The witnesses might revert to us on that, the sums of money involved and the number of complaints received. I will examine again the information on prison committees. I am aware that 2014 was the starting year but I am looking for the number of complaints received in 2019. That would be appreciated. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Hardship payments, yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McCaffrey.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have raised Standing Order 218 previously and I said that the issue would become more prevalent and it has, unfortunately. I am a new member of the committee and at the initial meeting, we were greeted with the new Standing Order 218. From my understanding of the committee prior to joining it, the Standing Order has put the kibosh on our ability to question witnesses or certainly put pressure on the Chair to ensure that there is compatibility with the Standing Orders of the House. I ask that the impact on our committee be analysed at the weekly meeting of the Oireachtas committee Chairmen and, indeed, by the Committee on Procedure, of which I understand I am now a member. I really think it only impacts on this committee and not so much on others. It is imperative that we do that because when Covid is over and we have longer than two-hour sessions with witnesses, the impact of the Standing Order will come into sharper focus and be unfair to this committee. As Deputy Catherine Murphy eloquently said, it will impact more on us as committee members and favour those who are here as witnesses. It is important that we deal with this matter as soon as possible, preferably in January before the committee meets again. I appeal to the Chairman, as the guardian of the committee, that we deal with this matter. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As a member of the committee, I take exception to what the Chairman said about him as Chairman and other committees not having to jostle over certain issues. I think the Committee of Public Accounts does trump a number of committees. They may decide they want to discuss certain issues with certain witnesses but from the point of view of public accountability, we should have the privilege of inviting witnesses in and discussing certain issues irrespective of whether another committee also wants to do that because we cut through the issue of whether it has a certain departmental aspect, be it health or education. We can still invite them in and it is important for this committee to retain the ability to do that. Standing Order 218 affects our ability to question those witnesses. Irrespective of whether any other committee has standing in the House to do that with that organisation, we should still be able to do that. I would not like us to lose that ability. I would like us to retain it and through the Chairman, I would like us to push for that more. As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, of all committees, this committee needs to ensure that Standing Order 218 has a better re-balancing for committee members.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. We can still invite them in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with Deputy Colm Burke and getting feedback from the parties and from the Oireachtas committee chairpersons would be important. It probably has more of an impact on the Committee of Public Accounts than any other committee but it would be important to tease out the discussions the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has had with other committee chairs. Is there a weekly meeting of committee chairpersons? When do committee chairpersons meet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought it was frequent-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it mainly an issue for this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It will change the dynamic of this committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that, my understanding is that members of this committee who are also members of the CPP may not be able to sit in on the discussion at the CPP. I await clarification of that but that is my understanding. I made it clear on my appointment to the CPP that I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not know who else is in that position. If that is the case, it changes the dynamic as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If I am the only member who is a member of both committees, I will be happy to clarify the matter myself. I was not a full-time member of the Committee on Procedure. I was standing in for somebody else at the time this arose. There will be many members who will be members of both committees at times. The issue around Standing Order 218 needs to be resolved for this committee in particular.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will that be in January?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the procedure for questioning witnesses on correspondence sent in after an appearance at the Committee of Public Accounts? How soon does a body come back after an appearance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. In terms of Miesian Plaza, I remember their response on that. They stated that it would hopefully be concluded quite soon. We might monitor that over the next couple of months. If it is not resolved as they had indicated to the committee, we might reinvestigate that over time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with the issue of survivors and their applications, I know the witnesses will not go into any individual case nor will I. I will just highlight one without identifying anybody. I note that home improvements accounted for €68.1 million of expenditure. Last summer, in respect of the staying at home, home help and tenants support scheme, I made contact with Caranua on behalf of a survivor. This individual is living in a family home that happened to be rented from the local authority. Therefore, there seemed to be a bit of an issue. I wondered about it at the time so it is opportune for me to ask how many other individuals found that difficult. It was a kitchen upgrade because the property, which I saw myself, required that but that individual found it very difficult to access what I call their funds. How was that the case? Ms Downes has stated there is a complaints mechanism and that there were two complaints this year. How many complaints have been made since 2013? One should remember that some of these people are extremely vulnerable individuals who are not used to articulating or are sometimes unable to articulate their concerns and, therefore, some of them might turn to public representatives.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware of that. That was not about repairs. Under the home help and tenant support scheme, an individual is able to re-carpet the house or do things a tenant is responsible for doing. I found it exceptionally difficult in this case. We were in contact through written correspondence. Eventually, it did work out. How many complaints have been received since 2013?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Downes does not have it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How many were made last year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In her opening statement, Ms Downes said that a surplus was available during 2020 and Caranua initiated a number of projects to re-engage with survivors and access their individual limit of €15,000. Last summer, I understood there was going to be a cut-off mark for that home help and tenant support scheme - probably towards the end of last year, which was correspondence I saw - but I now understand that it was extended and has been extended even further due to Covid, which is welcome. How many survivors have not engaged given the fact that 6,181 are eligible? I know there is money left over but how many people is Caranua unable to engage with? What is the process there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. Does Ms Downes know from the list Caranua had how many survivors still-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for cutting across Ms Downes but my time is limited. Is Ms Downes saying that based on the list with which she was provided that ranged from 2013 to the present day, in theory, there are about 5,000 survivors with whom there has been no engagement?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the process for those individuals subsequent to the wind down of Caranua? What happens then?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So it goes to the Department.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Ms Downes to come back to me, particularly with the regard to the tenant support scheme and the number of complaints because I have concerns about individuals from whom none of us have ever heard but who have made an application for access to their €15,000. From where I am sitting, that money is theirs to spend. I accept what Ms Downes said about repairs and items for which a local authority or another landlord is responsible.Where it goes to home improvements and making their quality of life better, we should do our damnedest to ensure money gets to them and they get the benefit.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see that but we are talking about the other element. I thank the witness.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am a new enough member of this committee but I have to say that with all the other witnesses who have come before us, when questions were asked we got detailed answers. I have not found that today. There has been a lot of the witnesses saying that they will come back to us or that they do not have information to hand, not just in response to my contribution but to those of others as well. I am a bit surprised by that because from our perspective, Caranua will be wound down from March, although that may be extended, so this is our opportunity on behalf of not only the survivors but the public to question certain elements.Nobody is casting aspersions on any individual here. We are just asking questions about how the fund was operated. On that basis - and Ms Hynes from the Department might be able to come back in on this - when is this legislation on the wind-down of Caranua anticipated to come before the Houses? Equally, because the list of correspondence that Ms Downes is going to come back to us on is getting longer and longer as the meeting goes on, I suggest that we might analyse that, Chairman, and then examine it again as a committee, certainly prior to March because we may have follow-on questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Hynes for that but neither question was answered. While I know the legislation will come before the Houses in the new year, does she have a specific timeframe, perhaps to the nearest month? I am conscious that Caranua probably will not exist after 24 March. I think that is the date. On the issue of the data on the website, that is great, and I can look for those data after the meeting but I was hoping somebody attending the meeting might have the data to hand. That would have been much more useful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine if it is not available. I just thought it would be a good question to ask because it would give us as a committee a timeframe to work to. I will source the data myself.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and specifically the part dealing with concerns around tendering. I understand that it is the second year running that this issue has been highlighted. I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on the depth and breadth of this issue. How extensive has the lack of tendering been and what kinds of contracts are we talking about? I ask Mr. Griffin to outline the remedies put in place by the Department last year to correct this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously, this is a recurring issue. I hear what Mr. Griffin is saying, that the vast bulk of this relates to the NBP in 2019. What was the issue in 2018 and how is it going to be corrected going into 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry to cut across Mr. Griffin. Is the procurement unit a new unit as a result of the 2018 accounts or is it something that had been in the pipeline from 2018?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Mr. Griffin does not have the information on the following, I ask him to come back to me or to the committee on it. I understand from his opening remarks that €11 million was collected for the TV licence. Will he give a comparative figure as to how much money is outstanding to be collected?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the environmental fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to €37 million in his report. Will Mr. Griffin elaborate on what that money is used for? Will he also elaborate on the €15 million broadcast fund? What was the €27 million surplus for 2020 ultimately used for? If he does not have the time to reply or the information to hand, he can send it on to me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was with regard to the €27 million surplus that was used.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin very much.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman. I thank the witnesses for their time and for answering the questions they can answer. I understand that the report to which they have referred is due at the end of the month. It is a pity that it is not available to the committee today because it would help to inform members on many of the questions we have. Notwithstanding that, I understand the report will provide more information on the 700-odd claims that have been asked about already. On the issue of outpatients and the urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals, Mr. Gunning stated that they are being fitted out. I understand that the centre at Connolly Hospital opened in July 2019. Are there any outstanding claims relating to those centres that are being developed or kitted out or have been opened? Is it the same contractor?  On the issue of the HSE grant, how much is the HSE grant to date? I am not sure whether that is a question for Mr. Dempsey. One of the other witnesses may have that information. I note that the grant had been increasing year on year since the start of the project. I ask the witnesses to inform the committee in that regard. On the PwC report from April 2019, I note that there are several recommendations in the report.I understand members of the board appeared before this committee previously, although not Mr. Gunning. As I understand it, he started in his role in September 2019. The cost of that PwC report and the recommendations contained in it are of interest to me with respect to the impact they had on the project. I have heard today that, unfortunately, costs may still be increasing every month as well as the timeline for the delivery of this muc- needed hospital. Mr. Gunning might respond to those points. I advise the Chair I might come in again in the short period I have remaining.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Devine for that response. Was the unit in Connolly Hospital delivered on budget and on time, or what was the scale with the delivery of that unit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was it the same contractor?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Murphy-Fagan and her colleagues and Mr. Costello from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In terms of the number of overruns over the years, on which some of the questions have already been asked, I note the National Shared Services Office was established in 2014 after a Government decision in 2012. It officially commenced in 2018 and this project was given a green light in January 2016. Colleagues have asked about the new target date nine years after the original indication that this financial management shared service would be established. It is a considerable delay, Covid or no Covid. I accept what Ms Murphy-Fagan has said in her responses thus far. I note it is a mammoth task to amalgamate the 31 different systems. How old and varied are those systems that the office is trying to amalgamate? I note what Ms Murphy-Fagan said earlier in response to another question about the staff who are already working in the various Departments. What are the old systems on which they are operating?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was not factored in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that. I am sorry but I have limited time. Will Ms Murphy-Fagan give us an indication on the number of years? She might come back to the committee with the years to which those older systems date back. That would be important. I want to pick up on something. Ms Murphy-Fagan mentioned the external reviews. I note there were several of them, in May 2018 and in February and May 2019. Does Ms Murphy-Fagan have the costs for each of these?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Ms Murphy-Fagan just have the cost of each of these reports?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that. Again, Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to us with the cost. It seems that today is all about costs. I accept the system is complex and that deadlines are moved but the sheer volume of costs we are speaking about is phenomenal. Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to the committee on this. I want to turn to fraud. Internal fraud of €30,500 was detected in 2019. It took place in 2018 and 2019. Has that money been recouped yet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is no problem. If I can, in the last minute of my time, I will ask a question of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I understand improved internal controls have been put in place in the NSSO and I note the Comptroller and Auditor General meets the NSSO's audit and risk committee once a year. Perhaps the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General might inform us as to whether the internal controls have improved from their perspective.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to raise two elements which I do not believe have been touched on. According to the reports, in 2019, the NSSO had 750 staff. How many are on secondment from other Departments or organisations?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are other elements on which Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to me, which we discussed earlier, namely the age of the various systems the organisation is amalgamating with the new system and the cost of those external reviews. The NSSO is a stand-alone organisation. It has offices in Dublin, Kerry, Galway and Offaly. Are they leased, owned or shared with other organisations? Can Ms Murphy-Fagan give a breakdown on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume those leases are from third parties.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to the committee on some of those costs. The conversation today has been on costs associated with the NSSO and the financial management shared services. It would be interesting to delve into that area also. I thank Ms Murphy-Fagan and her colleagues for giving of their time today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I confirm that I am here in Leinster House. I welcome Mr. Kavanagh and Ms Eade and thank them for their attendance. I will start with some questions on Leopardstown racetrack, which is in my constituency. I welcome the redevelopment that is taking place there and which is long overdue. It is very good that it has started. I also welcome the works under way at the Curragh. Mr. Kavanagh might not have the information I am looking for to hand, in which case he might send it to me after the meeting. I am interested in the numbers of attendees at Leopardstown in 2017, 2018 and 2019. In regard to the redevelopment taking place there, I note in the documentation we received in advance of the meeting a reference to a number of claims with the contractors. I am not asking the witnesses to get into what those claims are about but will they indicate how many there are?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Kavanagh. I note that the accounts refer to rental income, which relates, I presume, to premises, stands and whatnot. Will Mr. Kavanagh elaborate on what the rental income is for and what HRI is leasing out?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. Turning to the 2019 accounts, I note that HRI spent €120,000 on public relations and marketing in 2018 but this figure reduced to €81,000 in 2019. What was the rationale for that reduction in spending? I would have thought it would have increased, if anything.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. We need to talk about the impact of Brexit, which will be clearer once the Covid crisis is over. Covid is the first hurdle, if I may be excused that pun. What impact is Brexit having on horse racing in Ireland since 1 January?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume the additional cost that is associated with that is a huge challenge for the industry and, indeed, for horse owners.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the representatives of the OGP for their time. My first question relates to the long-running interpretation and translation services case. I appreciate that it was successfully defended in the High Court and I am not going to go into the merits and the detail of the case. I know the OGP cannot either because I understand it is being judicially reviewed. I am not sure if that has concluded. However, does Mr. Quinn have an estimated cost for that long-running process at this point, given I understand the final decision was made in May 2019? Also, how has that particular case changed the procurement rules for the Office of Government Procurement?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good, I thank Mr. Quinn. My second question is on the non-competitive procurement and, as the Comptroller and Auditor General and members will be aware, in recent months we have had a number of bodies and Departments come before the committee where it has been noted in the accounts that there have been contracts that have been extended or rolled over. I am aware that this can be for various reasons but I seek the OGP's perspective on ensuring that people are complying with procurement rules. In some cases those roll-overs and extensions last several years. Therefore, from the OGP's point of view, how is that dealt with, how is it prevented from happening and how do we ensure the public purse is getting value for money?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept the OGP is not policing that particular rule but how often would the office reiterate that, particularly in light of Covid-19? As we exit the pandemic period, I presume we are going to see quite a few extensions and roll-overs over the next couple of years in separate accounts. In order to ensure there is a competitive process, and as I say-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----value for money is secured for the public purse, how often does the office reiterate that need to put contracts out to tender?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Should I take it that the OGP issues regular reminders to people just to ensure that those Accounting Officers are adhering to the rules? I know it cannot follow up if they are, but does the office issue reminders on that basis?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for letting me back in. On the issue of the contracts that have been extended, or roll-over contracts, do the witnesses have an idea of the number we are talking about annually? I note from the report that there are several of those lasting several years.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Having reviewed them for 2019, does Mr. Quinn have an idea, even off the top of his head, of the number we are talking about? Are we talking about 100, 300 or more?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Quinn might come back to me on it, if he does not mind.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Quinn. That would be helpful because it has come up time and again with various bodies and Departments. I understand some of them are necessary but with regard to others it is a bone of contention, particularly for suppliers who, when they see something up on eTenders and they are not successful, find that something has not even been tendered. It is important for me and, presumably, the witnesses, that we see that good processes are followed to ensure that there is a competitive nature in all tenders.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses. I thank them for their presentation and the slides they provided in advance of today's meeting. I have a few questions on foot of that. Based on when SBCI was initially established I understand that a loss of more than €5.2 million has been incurred up to 2019. Is there a bad debt provision for the SBCI and if not, why not?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is not going to happen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand what Mr. Black is saying about the establishment costs but the ongoing expenses for SBCI, in terms of premises, financial management, procurement, HR and administration, are all linked with the NTMA. Surely the costs being incurred are quite minimal unless the SBCI is being billed for those pro rata. In his opening remarks, Mr. Black mentioned he used intermediaries to get lending out to market but I note that the SBCI also spent €1 million on advertising. Given the link between the intermediaries and their promotion of the SBCI, why is there a need to spend so much money?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those establishment costs, given the connection to the NTMA, are surely not that much, are they?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How long can an entity, be it an SME in Ireland or a subsidiary from another jurisdiction, be established before it can apply and approach SBCI for funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	An Irish SME or maybe a subsidiary from another jurisdiction but for all intents and purposes it is an Irish SME. How long does it have to be established before it can approach the SBCI for funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What makes them eligible? Do they have to be trading for two years, one year or five months? Are there criteria there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is no requirement on trading time, is there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Sweeney and Mr. Black.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair for allowing be back in. I wish to ask Mr. Black and his colleagues about the strategic review. How is it proceeding and what elements of it is the SBCI proceeding with in 2021? That is my first question. I will ask my second question if there is time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Were any internal recommendations made about processes within the organisation and how clients and portfolios are handled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On internal controls, for instance, I note that the SBCI has an audit and risk committee, a credit committee, a remuneration committee, and others. Without having to name members, what organisations are represented on those committees to ensure proper oversight?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In his correspondence, the Secretary General, Mr. Griffin, mentions that a value for money review of the Eircode system will be conducted at some point this year. Can the committee be furnished with that review once it is complete? Can we examine it and bring the Department back in at some point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McMahon for his contribution to the committee. He has interesting observations. I understand from his opening remarks that he has been dealing with this issue for quite a number of years, so I admire his persistence on the issue. In terms of the bogus self-employed, Mr. McMahon mentioned couriers, meter workers and journalists, for example. How prevalent does he believe the overall issue is in society?I looked at the NESC report from November of last year and it says it is about 10% of those who were declared self-employed in Dublin and elsewhere, yet in Kerry for example, it was higher, at around 21%, which might tally with Mr. McMahon's earlier remarks about farm labourers, etc. I am interested in his opinion on the NESC report from November 2020. I have heard him refer quite a bit to couriers today, but in which other sectors and areas does he believe bogus self-employment is very prominent? How many workers are we talking about? He referred to pensions or, in his opinion, the lack thereof, but how many employees are we talking about across the State at any given time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McMahon. Could he comment please on the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report from November last year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I take that point but, in brief, what is Mr. McMahon's feedback on the report from NESC?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. McMahon think it accurately captures the extent of the problem?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McMahon.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses and thank them for their attendance. I have another committee meeting after this one so I apologise for having to leave after my questioning. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is broad and so are my questions. I look forward to engaging with each and every witness. I will start with programme A. Mr. Gleeson mentioned animal welfare. I noticed that the current spend on this is €3 million less than was spent in 2019. On the capital side, only half was spent compared with what was estimated to be spent in 2019. Could Mr. Gleeson elaborate on that and why that came to pass? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. My question concerns the World Food Programme. Mr. Gleeson mentioned that it was an advance on 2020. I understand this and it is welcome and proper. Given the scale of challenge for that UN programme, particularly after Covid-19, could Mr. Gleeson elaborate as to how he sees the 2021 programme developing? Obviously, there was, as he noted, a request from the executive director in 2019 for an advance but how might that impact on 2021 and ensuing years? I know it is a three-year agreement so I am wondering when it is due to be renewed. Mr. Gleeson might elaborate on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If I can help Mr. Gleeson, I will ask it in a different format. Could he outline the role and importance of Department inspections in the horse racing and greyhound industries? He might have a figure. If he does not have one today, he might come back to me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gleeson. I presume it is quite similar moving to the meat processing plants. I was a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and the meat processing plants played a central role through our investigations into the spread of Covid-19 throughout 2020. Mr. Gleeson might elaborate on that. I know the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and the HSE are the agents carrying out the inspections but my understanding is that Mr. Gleeson's Department has ultimate responsibility in respect of the inspections. Will he outline to the committee the number of inspections done in 2020 and the number done so far in 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would ditch those headphones if I were Mr. Gleeson because we can hear him clearly now, much better than we did with them on.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Gleeson can come back to me on the number of inspections last year but I think the public would want reassurance that the inspections are ongoing. Is that the case?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that. I thank Mr. Gleeson for that. I have limited time, so apologies. It is reassuring to know that they are ongoing. It was not just Covid-19 that impacted on last year and 2019; it was Brexit also. I come from a coastal constituency in Dún Laoghaire and we are very proud to have BIM located in the town. I note that the seafood industry in 2020 accounted for a little over €1 billion but I understand that was down 18% on 2019. The funding of that service, of BIM, is essential. Will Mr. Gleeson outline the role and operation of the Department in dealing with both Brexit and Covid-19 over the past two years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gleeson for that. I will turn to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, particularly in respect of the procurement issues. There were some non-compliance issues. I believe there were 98 contracts in total with a value of a little over €14 million. In the same vein, I note also that there was the risk and control framework. That predates my time but I understand that in 2017, there was some sort of internal audit committee that, to my surprise, was wound down in the Department. I am happy to see, however, that a new risk management system has been put in place and there is an estimated timeframe. Is it the asset verification register that is due to be complete by 2021? Are we still on track for that to be completed this year? Also, Mr. Gleeson might comment on how his Department is dealing with the non-compliance issues as outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, the asset verification project was expected to be done by 2021. Are we still on track with that? The Department would want to make sure that the project is completed by the time Mr. Gleeson appears before us next year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Like my colleague, I compliment RTÉ at the outset concerning its 'school on TV' initiative which ran during the lockdown. It was really beneficial for many primary school students during that time. It was well done and well produced. Well done on that. Turning to the reduction in the deficit run by RTÉ, it was €13 million in 2018 and that was down to €7 million in 2019. I note that Ms Forbes spoke of some cost-cutting measures, but how was that deficit reduction achieved?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with finance, what proportion of income generated in 2019 and 2020 by RTÉ came from the licence fee? I note that Ms O'Shea said there was an increase in the amount allocated from the licence fee to RTÉ. That contrasted with commercial revenue, which Ms O'Shea stated has reduced in recent years.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The remainder then is commercial revenue. Is it correct that this is the other funding stream for RTÉ?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am not sure who is going to take this next question, but the last appearance by Ms Forbes before this committee was in May 2018 and a report was compiled in July of that year. I note that public funding in 2016, for instance, was €179.3 million, while commercial revenue stood at €158.2 million. Where do those figures stand today compared to 2016? Has RTÉ's commercial revenue improved since 2016 or has the licence fee income improved? I ask that because I note that Ms Forbes stated in her opening remarks that the evasion rate for the licence fee was in and around 15% for 2020. Back in 2018, it was similar enough at about 15% as well. Is that the average percentage of evasion? I ask Ms Forbes to deal with the issue of the comparison between commercial revenue and licence fee income first, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. If I can turn to the task RTÉ has ahead of itself in the context of digital content, when she was last before the committee in May 2018, Ms Forbes recognised that this is a major challenge for RTÉ in this regard. How has the organisation championed that in the past number of years and how has it improved matters on the digital front?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Forbes for that. In terms of the evasion rate and the collection for the licence fee, Ms Forbes has been a big advocate of reforming the licence fee and what it is charged for. She mentioned that we have one of the highest average rates of collection in Europe. Can she explain why the cost of collection and the evasion rate are higher here than in other jurisdictions across Europe?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will come back to the Department in the second round. Finally, can Ms Forbes indicate the percentage home-grown programming and productions versus other content that RTÉ purchases on an annual basis? Has she a percentage breakdown in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be very helpful. Do I have time for one more question?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought so. I thank Ms Forbes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a question for the departmental officials. I said I would come back to the issue of the licence fee. I know there was a talk of a renewal or a rejig of the fee. A working group was set up in the previous Dáil. What status does that have at present? Why is the cost for the collection of the licence fee so high in Ireland in comparison with our European counterparts? I will not say the Department's full name because that would take up more time than I have.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for presenting these accounts to us. I wish to ask him about the Digital Hub Development Agency and the qualification he made about the vacant site levy. Could he elaborate a little bit more on where that site is and how come it came to be flagged? Has this issue arisen previously or is this a new issue facing the agency?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will come back on the Comptroller and Auditor General's response. Depending on how long the review may take and its outcome, it is important that we might seek to put the agency on our upcoming work programme.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I confirm I am in the convention centre. I thank Mr. Walsh and his colleagues for their attendance. Mr. Walsh mentioned the board's investments in ICT and I note the new website, which is very welcome. However, there are still some teething issues which I want to raise directly, particularly around the SHDs, for as long as they are with us. The issue is the cost of that particular project. To me, it would seem a little late, particularly around the SHDs. I know there are other rationales for having a new website, but the SHDs were brought in back in 2017 yet we only have a new website now in 2021. Will Mr. Walsh outline how much that project cost, when it started and for how long it has been ongoing?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know the board brought in other changes internally but, for the end-user, it was mainly the website. Mr. Walsh might clarify the cost of the website and how long that has been in train.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Ms Killian have a separate cost for the website?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can Ms Killian make a direct submission on the new website now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, but for third party appeals to normal planning applications, can people make a-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for all of that. In terms of that cost, a phenomenal amount of money has been spent. I shudder to think how much money was spent prior to 2014. Obviously, either catch-up was being played by the organisation and there was a lack of spend over time, or there was a complete revamp. From the end-user perspective of the website, particularly as I mentioned SHDs, from 2017 on there was very little improvement, if any, in the website's public interface. I am not saying that the staff have not been helpful to the public, and they have. However, from a complete project point of view, when so many applications were coming the way of An Bord Pleanála through the SHD process, and the strategic infrastructure as well, I question why it is only now, in 2021, that the website has been updated, given that, ironically, the SHDs are going to be phased out at the end of 2021.Mr. Walsh might forward on those costs please after today's session.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How am I doing on time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I look forward to getting the information.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Deputy MacSharry asked me to pass on his apologies to the committee today. I thank Dr. Sweeney for his presentation. Much research has gone into it and it is welcome. How many existing tenancies remain under the rent supplement scheme? From my experience RAS was better than the rent supplement scheme. HAP was also better than RAS. There are flaws and there is an over-reliance on each of those schemes. With rent supplement, I was aware of some tenancies falling into arrears for various reasons at the time. Does Dr. Sweeney have a breakdown of the number of tenancies that fell into arrears which were in receipt of rent supplement?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Dr. Sweeney have figures from his research for the number of landlords who have exited RAS since its inception and to the point when it will be phased out?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I compliment Dr. Sweeney again on his presentation. For the committee, the figures are quite startling and the money spent is enormous. Does he have a figure for the number of people who availed of each of the schemes broken down by local authority across the country? Does he have a breakdown of the cost of running those schemes versus the cost of construction during a similar period?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for cutting across but my time is limited. I presume that is because of that top-up that so many people have to avail of in the Dublin region, given the price of properties. Does Dr. Sweeney have any data on the numbers availing of the top-up to avail of rent support in the Dublin region or in other major population centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know I was asking Dr. Sweeney for additional information. It would be greatly appreciated if he could furnish the committee with any other information he might have. I thank him for appearing before us today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for attending this morning. I also thank them for the detailed information they provided in advance of today's meeting which is greatly appreciated. My first question is for Mr. Clonan. I represent Dún Laoghaire and obviously I have great affinity and respect for the work that the Irish Coast Guard does, in particular the volunteers in the Dún Laoghaire Coast Guard unit. My information is that the Dún Laoghaire Coast Guard is quite busy and I expect it to be far busier this summer given the requirements for an outdoor summer. That will place considerable pressure and strain on the volunteers. My information is that 20 volunteers are attached to the Dún Laoghaire Coast Guard. How is the recruitment of new volunteers nationally going? Obviously, I am sure that the Dún Laoghaire Coast Guard could do with more. Is there a cap on the number of volunteers attached to each Coast Guard station? I also seek information about the replacement of and investment in equipment for Coast Guard stations.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, they do. Staying with that issue, Mr. Clonan mentioned vehicles. Is it true that volunteers cannot use their vehicles? I understand that in some stations they can. Obviously, however, it limits their ability to respond if they cannot. I understand that the Coast Guard vehicles are one of the four blue light vehicles but they are limited in where they can use those vehicles. Maybe that is more a question to the Department than Mr. Clonan, but that hampers the ability of volunteers, depending on their location, to respond to incidents. I am just thinking ahead to this summer, as I said. I am nervous because they do fantastic work, the volunteers are on call 24-7 and we need to ensure they can respond but my information is that some stations can use the vehicles and bring them home so they can respond more quickly to incidents while other stations cannot. What are the criteria there? Who can use the vehicles and when?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is really welcome. I am delighted to hear that that is in the pipeline and under way. Finally, if I am a volunteer with the Coast Guard-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No problem at all.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will not have time to get verbal answers, so can Mr. Spratt or Mr. Clonan come back to me or the committee in writing? Staying with programme C, in terms of the volunteer use of vehicles, if I am a volunteer, the vehicle has to be stored at the base, but is not practical for me to get from my home to the base. Can Mr. Clonan drop a note to clarify the use of those vehicles? It is important we get more vehicles for our stations, but also that they are able to be used. Is there a strategic plan for the Irish Coast Guard? If there is, can Mr. Clonan furnish me with a copy? The national oil spill contingency planning is under the remit of Department of Transport. When was the last time that was undertaken or practised? I ask the witnesses to come back to me in writing. I thank Mr. Spratt for the information. What subheading does the marine casualty investigation board come under? I could not find it in the accounts. In March, I put a question on the transfer of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, among five harbours included. I am sure Mr. Spratt and his Department are delighted to have all that handed over to a different Department. I am inquiring about the funding. I have asked about the funding which was given to local authorities on the transfer of that. It seems funding was given to certain local authorities and not to others. My main concern was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown not getting a penny. Can Mr. Spratt do a review of that and furnish the committee or me with that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Many of the questions I hoped to raise have been asked at this point. In terms of the accounts we are discussing today, there was non-compliance with procurement rules. Can Mr. Doyle outline how nine contracts totalling over €500,000 came about and how they were not in compliance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There was concern regarding the expenditure on flooding. I presume this is the remit of the Office of Public Works, OPW. Is there somebody present who can speak about that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My other question is about local authorities being held accountable for the implementation of the National Oversight and Audit Commission's report. What is being done to make sure local authorities are in compliance with the commission's recommendations?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There have been many questions in respect of HAP and RAS. What has the Department done to try to ensure that landlords who are signed up to HAP with local authorities are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB? As public representatives, all us know about and have come across issues of low standards of accommodation for tenants. What has the Department done in that regard to try to encourage landlords to register with the RTB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If issues arise with tenants and the landlord is not registered with the RTB, what protections can be provided by the Department?What can the local authority offer those tenants who are in that particular predicament?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Mr. Lemass to send on further information.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That will be very helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise as I am deputising for another Deputy at another votable committee. I defer my time to colleagues on this occasion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statement. First, I wish Mr. Burgess well in his next endeavours. Starting with the positive, I pay tribute to him and his staff for the wonderful information they disseminate on social media. Mr. Burgess leads from the top in that regard. He is very active on Twitter and that applies across the various missions across the globe. I congratulate him on the work he has done. I also pay tribute to the staff in the various diplomatic missions across the world for their support to Irish citizens in the face of the pandemic. From early 2020 all of us parliamentarians were engaging with the Department and the work it did and support it gave to citizens in need of sometimes just simple information, but also with regard to repatriation. On that point, does Mr. Burgess have a number? He may have said it in the opening statement and I did not catch it. Does he have the number of people the Department assisted in terms of repatriation from early 2020 and the cost associated with that? That is my first question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Burgess for that information. He mentioned the Peruvian repatriation. Constituents of mine needed to avail of that and it was quite complex owing to the location in which they found themselves. The support and information available to them and the assistance given to them on the ground were exemplary. I want to put that on the record. On the passport service, I note what Ms Jones said about the volume of renewals and new passport applications. We are all being contacted by constituents at this time. The online service is working excellently. The point was correctly made that people need to provide correct information in order for a passport to be issued. However, there are some anomalies in that regard and where these are brought to the Department's attention, they are generally dealt with very quickly. I thank the Department for that. Is there a figure for the number of renewals expected before the year end? A large number of people have not looked at their passport because they are not planning to travel abroad.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have three brief questions. I heard Mr. Burgess say that there were 259 families impacted or requiring repatriation due to citizens who had died abroad. I know this is a sensitive issue for those impacted. I am also aware of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, KBRT, which I am sure the Department is as it works closely with it. Are there any plans on behalf of the Department to re-examine the support for families that have been impacted by bereavement abroad and that require that service? If the witnesses do not have time to come back on my second question they might send me a note on it. On expanding the Irish footprint abroad with our diplomatic missions, I understand the witnesses said that missions in Morocco and Philippines will be opening in 2022. My understanding was that would take place in 2020 and a further 13 missions were anticipated to be open by 2025. On our diplomatic missions, particularly in the more challenging areas and regions, Deputy Sherlock referred earlier to physical security reviews for both the diplomatic missions themselves and our staff. How often are they conducted? I note that there was a saving of €897,000 in that arena in 2019. While that is welcome and I compliment the Department on making savings, it is important that we spend wisely and that we ensure we have the best and most robust security system.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I do not. I will have to leave the meeting just before 10 a.m. because I am chairing a meeting of another committee. I apologise.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Maney and Mr. O'Keeffe. I welcome Ms Maney to her role, which is new enough, and commend her on the work she has undertaken in a short period. She took over at a very difficult time and from reading her report and the other information given to us, particularly around case management conferences and hearings that were re-established during the height of the pandemic, it was very important that they were re-established as quickly as possible. I have a number of broad-ranging questions but am limited by time so I would appreciate if the replies could be brief. The witness would be familiar with the alternative dispute resolution system in the UK. The commission runs case management conferences so how similar are they? How frequently are they used? In what kinds of cases are they used? They cannot be used with all appeals but Ms Maney might outline the circumstances in which they are done versus in a hearing, for example. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A percentage of cases are heard via case management conference. What percentage of the cases dealt with by the commission are progressed in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Maney might come back to us with that, out of interest. In terms of an appellant making a decision on whether to appeal the assessment from Revenue, 44% of cases were withdrawn by the appellants. If more information was given by Revenue at an earlier stage, would it change the course of an appellant bringing a case? What is the experience with appellants not of Ms Maney but of the commissioners? Is it an issue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. I know it is straying into the arena of the Revenue Commissioners.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The committee has dealt with the Revenue Commissioners previously. From our perspective we are trying to understand the interaction between the TAC and Revenue and trying to make a recommendation for improvements. In a bizarre way, although many witnesses do not believe it, the Committee of Public Accounts is here to help. In terms of the supply of information from Revenue to the appellant and the reason for the assessment, in the UK there is a slightly different system with which I am sure Ms Maney is familiar. Would this type of system be more appropriate here? Perhaps it is unfair of me to ask. I am conscious we have a report to compile after this in which we will make recommendations. Is there a need for reform at that early stage?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We might follow up on this with the Department when it comes before us next. An appellant has 30 days from the time of Revenue's assessment. Is this sufficient time? Does the commission find that people are rushed? It could come out of the blue for some. I am speaking about individuals rather than the corporate side.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Equally for the corporate side there might be the same concern. Does Ms Maney think 30 days is sufficient? Is it longer in the UK?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is all right.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I stand to be corrected but I believe in the UK it could be 60 days before a decision has to be taken by a prospective appellant. To turn to the TAC itself, I note there was an underspend because staff could not be taken on. How is the commission getting on with this? Earlier, Ms Maney said there were four commissioners. There was an underspend because of non-recruitment. Is it just commissioners that the TAC is looking to take on? What expertise is it looking to take on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	First, I want to give apologies from Deputies MacSharry and McAuliffe, please. I must also go to another committee meeting after this. I wish to return to a few items. Out of the legacy cases that have been outstanding for some time, am I correct that 12 are still outstanding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The commission is making progress and, as Ms Maney says, by the end of the year it should be complete.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was a bit confused by chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which said that at the end of 2019 there were 3,357 open appeal cases. It said that in the period of 2016 to 2019, the commission closed over 3,900 appeal cases.How many cases since 2016, when the commission was established, has it dealt with overall? Does Ms Maney have that figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wanted to clarify that. I missed the earlier discussion. I refer to the length of time between an appellant deciding to take a case and the case being heard by the commission. What is the average waiting time for that process?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the internal desire to deal with cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Am I not correct in saying that for appellants there are interests and penalties charged? In theory, they are paying for that delay or the length of time it takes. If the appeal is found in the appellant's favour, it is unfair if he or she has to pay penalties because of a delay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can appreciate that. The UK system is further down the road than us and has far more experience. I am speaking for individuals and not the corporate world. People who might not have the wherewithal to be able to pay money until a determination has been made are lumbered with further penalties and interest on the sum that Revenue makes. That is a recommendation that the committee will look at. Ms Maney will come back to me on a previous question I asked. She might also inform us how many cases have prepaid and how many have not paid at all and, therefore, would have been subject to penalties. That is of interest to the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We can take that up with Revenue. On the IT system and the 2019 accounts, I note there is an underspend of €259,000. Ms Maney said a new IT system is coming in. In terms of the data that the commission received from Revenue, are the systems compatible with each other?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to know. In her opening remarks, Ms Maney mentioned recommendations. I was unsure if she was speaking solely about the recommendations from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that were all being worked through, or whether she was also referring to recommendations from the last time the Tax Appeals Commission appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts in 2018. I understand there were three recommendations from that time. Can Ms Maney confirm to the committee whether all of the recommendations in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the previous committee report will be implemented by the end of the year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Some of them may form the discussions the commission had with the Department of Finance because some were outside of the commission's control but were recommendations from our committee. Ms Maney can come back to me on that. I do not have the recommendations to hand.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Maney.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statements. We all want to see a national children's hospital built, completed and fully operational as soon as possible. During our last engagement, we heard about the number of claims that were potentially outstanding. As other speakers noted, it is extremely regrettable and very worrying that we cannot get a handle on the cost. We are here on behalf of the public to establish the costs to, and potential exposure of, the public purse in respect of this project. For the witnesses to come here this morning and say they cannot estimate that cost, or will not do so out of fear of litigation, is worrying from our perspective and will be worrying for the public. That is not to take away from the importance and strategic nature of the children's hospital. I look forward to visiting the site again. I was there before when I was on the HSE's regional health forum prior to being elected to the Dáil. I look forward to seeing the progress made on site. I have a number of questions for the witnesses. Colleagues have asked about claims. I refer to the report of this committee in 2019 arising out of its engagement with the witnesses. Recommendation No. 1 stood out for me. It notes: "The Committee finds it absolutely unacceptable that nobody can give a reasonably accurate estimate of the expected final costs for the completion and fitting out of the National Children's Hospital." Two years later, we are still none the wiser and that is why I am so worried. It is really concerning that, two years on and given the delays that have occurred, both the witnesses from the board and the Department still cannot estimate the cost. Recommendation No. 2 in the report states:The Committee agrees with the recommendations presented in PwC's New Children's Hospital Independent review of escalation of costs, April 2019. The Committee recommends that all 11 recommendations in review are implemented without delay.Can Mr. Gunning inform the committee whether the 11 recommendations from that PwC report have been fully implemented?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. In terms of the-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that the recommendations that are under the board's control are the ones Mr. Gunning is addressing. I would not ask him to comment on any others. My next question is for Ms Prendergast. Is the Department of Health satisfied those recommendations have been implemented?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is ongoing engagement anyway between the Department and the development board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In his opening remarks, Mr. Gunning stated that he was hoping for a completion date in 2024 for the hospital. Is that early, mid or late 2024? No one foresaw this pandemic, obviously. Presuming all goes well between now and 2024, though, is he satisfied that timeframe will be adhered to?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Devine for his reply. I am conscious of my time. Mr. Gunning mentioned the digital hospital.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry. I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will ask two questions together if Mr. Gunning would not mind coming back to me. I was at another committee meeting so I ask Mr. Gunning to forgive me if he answered this question in my absence. There is a digital hospital element to the new children's hospital. Mr. Gunning has said it is going to be the first smart, digital hospital in Ireland. Give recent events in terms of ICT and the HSE cyberattack, what reassurances can Mr. Gunning give to this committee that it will be robust in its defences? I asked Mr. Gunning when he was previously before the committee about the completion date for the urgent care centre in Tallaght. Are we still on course for that date? What is that date? Are there any cost overruns or claims relating to that centre?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is absolutely the case.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to hear. Mr. Gunning did not respond to my question about claims and cost overruns for the Tallaght centre.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about claims?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Similar to Deputy Catherine Murphy, some of the queries I had have been answered. In terms of No. 13, the residential institutions statutory fund board, Caranua, we have had its representatives before the committee previously. I am not sure if it has been dissolved in the interim, but the Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to tell us a little more. I note he says there were inadequate controls over grant payments. We discussed that with the representatives previously, but the Comptroller and Auditor General might refer back to me. Also, there is Tusla and the significant non-compliant procurement. That is something we must flag, and likewise with the NTA and the ICT project. With regard to the Residential Tenancies Board and the management system for the tenancy registration, that is something we deal with regularly with constituents. The sum of €5.2 million is a significant amount. The Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to refer back to us on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There was the point about Tusla and the significant non-compliance and also the Residential Tenancies Board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with previous speakers about this. Like others, I was on the site and viewed the construction. It was my second time there in a period of eight to ten months so I have seen the development of the site and the progress made. What struck me from our visit was when those present spoke about changes being made and accounted for. Certain design changes had to be made and that accounted for costs and changes to plans. Ultimately, from our perspective as a committee, we must know the bottom line of how much the State will pay for this hospital. This has been rumbling on for years and certainly from that correspondence there does not seem to be any bottom line here. It is incumbent on us as a committee to probe that and try to get to the final cost or at least near enough to it. The public wants to know and it has a right to that. I agree with previous speakers that we should invite in representatives of both the Department and the board to discuss that element as it is progressing and what we have seen in recent months. It is still a long way off completion and we must have some sort of crystallisation of cost.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Reid and his colleagues and I thank him for his opening remarks. I apologise as I was not here at the time, but I have read his statement since. I will start with the grant-aid agreements, which have been a welcome addition to the entire process for section 38 and 39 organisations. There is a little bit more certainty and there is good engagement between the relevant CHO and the organisations. I also welcome the fact that contract management support units are being established across the nine CHOs. I have a quick question on the grant agreements. Where an organisation exists, but spans several CHOs, surely it would make more sense to have a single service level agreement or grant agreement with one particular body of the HSE rather than multiple grant-aid agreements?Is there a process in place for such a thing? I am not aware of it but I will ask that initially.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good. That makes sense. I thank Mr. Ryan for that clarification. In terms of the capital programme, to which Deputy Dillon referred, there is a real need for many of these section 38 and section 39 organisations, which either lease or maybe own their own building, to access capital funding. Is there any plan coming forward for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is very hard for those organisations to try to access capital funding. While I appreciate it is limited, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin, where we need extra capacity for some of these organisations, the benefit of unlocking capital funding is that it could expand those much-needed services. To stay with the section 38 and 39 organisations, I want to ask a few questions on the internal audit. There are anomalies with the Charities Regulator as well, and I would ask the HSE to examine that aspect. The Charities Regulator is asking some of those independent boards to do one thing and the HSE audit is saying it is frowned upon, so there are some anomalies there. How many audits have taken place since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report and what is the breakdown between random and targeted audits?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Reid have a breakdown between random and targeted audits? He can come back to me on that if he wants.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have limited time. In terms of the integrated financial management and procurement system, which is known as IFMS, I know that over the last couple of weeks, and even for the last number of years, the IT systems across the HSE have been questioned. What impact have the cyberattack and the pandemic had on the original budget for the financial management and procurement system within the HSE?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has the original date of March 2025 to have it implemented been pushed out to 2026?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The HSE might correspond with the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I did not get a chance to delve into the financial statements for 2020. On page 146, according to note 6, there has been an increase in agency staff. Is that more staff or higher salaries with the same staff?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a need to increase the level of agency staff for this year? What is the plan there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, with retirements and whatnot. I turn to note 4 on patient income on page 143. I assume it was the pandemic which saw the reduction in a lot of these charges, particularly the E111 claims. What does the heading "Road Traffic Accident Charges" relate to?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I support Deputy McAuliffe's proposal on having a focus to the meeting specifically around projects, including MetroLink, the DART underground and others. Given that these matters have been on the agenda for so many years, it is appropriate for the committee to examine the expenditure to date and the plans for the next number of years. If we can limit the discussion to the matters Deputies have raised, that will help us when we sit down with the Department in, it is to be hoped, the near future.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. I will have to head away after this as I must return to the Chamber. I thank Mr. McDonagh and the Comptroller and Auditor General for their opening statements. I will ask a few brief questions. Mr. McDonagh has highlighted that NAMA does not own the development sites in its portfolio and that they are instead owned by the debtors, which is straightforward enough. How many of the sites that were in the guardianship of NAMA, as it were, had full planning permission? Does Mr. McDonagh have that figure to hand?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Roughly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If a debtor did not maintain or extend the planning permission for one of those sites, the value of that asset would have depreciated significantly. Did NAMA encourage debtors to extend or maintain their planning permissions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This follows on from my questioning when NAMA was before the committee last year. I want to know whether there has been active management of those portfolios, given that we, as the taxpayers, want to ensure that we get the most value out of them. Is Mr. McDonagh telling us that his team actively encouraged and supported the extension of those planning permissions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. Mr. McDonagh specifically referenced the Dublin docklands. Was the figure he cited 86%?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that the figure for completions in the SDZ?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that on track?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How does that figure compare to the Poolbeg West SDZ, which had a much later start than the Dublin docklands?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume I have a few minutes, Chairman. Will Mr. McDonagh touch on the wind-down? He referenced the strategic plan from 2022 to 2025. What does it entail? He might talk the committee through it. The next time we speak, NAMA will probably be in the throes of that plan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The witness mentioned Fingal and Kildare.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening statements and for the information provided to the committee in advance. I will start with the escrow fund. I note Mr. O'Kelly's comments in his opening statement. The total net assets in the fund decreased by an alarming €36 million in 2020 and, I think, €16 million in 2019. That brings the fund to €13.98 billion, which is approximately 87.6% of its original value. The matters before the European courts may take a few years - and Mr. O'Kelly might offer his own opinion on that - but in terms of the exposure for the State, if this were to decrease further or go on for a number of years does Mr. O'Kelly estimate the amount in the fund dropping further? Is there an exposure to the State if the fund is not managed and is decreasing in value all the time? There is an equal relationship between Apple and the NTMA in managing the fund. I ask Mr. O'Kelly to comment on that matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Halloran for that. I presume, given that answer, that the NTMA will be back before the committee and we will be discussing escrow several times between now and a final determination by the European courts. Is there any liability for the State if the fund goes below a certain level? I accept that the NTMA is looking for a return, and it is not for investment purposes but just to manage the fund, but if that fund were to continue to fall, is there any stipulation in the agreement that there is any further liability to the State?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Kelly for that clarity. I think the annual operating charge is €7 million per annum. It is a fixed charge, if I understand correctly. Will the witnesses elaborate on that? What does the charge entail and who effectively is administrating it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, and €7 million between four entities is not too bad either on an annual basis, but that is a different day's work. As for the 2019 financial statements, there was a withholding tax of €2 million. Will the witnesses elaborate on that tax, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Halloran for the clarity on that. I have one last question about the escrow fund. I note that there is a formal investment meeting or deliberation in November and that there was another one in 2019, if I am not mistaken. The use of the word "formal" suggests there are informal, ongoing discussions or meetings regarding this fund. Can one of the witnesses elaborate on that element, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Kelly for that. The following questions may relate to Mr. Breen of the State Claims Agency, or somebody else may answer them. I note that there were 12,175 active claims by the end of 2020. That was a 5% increase on the figure for 2019, with an estimated total of €4 billion in potential liability. Can somebody give a breakdown sector by sector? I note there was some breakdown. I think it was 92% for Tusla and the Department of Health and, I think, 6% encompassing the Departments of Justice, Defence and Education. Is there a breakdown of that 92% between the Department of Health and Tusla? Do the witnesses have that with them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please. It would be helpful for all the various sectors. I know it has been broken down for us but it would be nice to see it broken down further. From the initial establishment in 2012, I think the liability at that stage stood at about €1 billion, so we have increased it rapidly over the years. What is the main reason for those continuous increases year on year, bearing in mind, as I said, that we had a 5% increase from 2019?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Breen. I note that 53% of the cases were resolved in 2020 without court proceedings being instigated, which is worthy of compliment. Mediation forms a large part of this. What other steps are being taken to reduce the liability and the number of claims year on year by the NTMA and the individual Departments and State agencies concerned?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for allowing us to come back in again. I will follow up on my earlier question on the need for further information about the breakdown of claims. Mr. Breen is going to supply that to the committee. That relates to 92% for Tusla and the Department of Health, and 6% for the Departments of Justice, Defence and Education. I will ask about the post office savings bank fund. I note two contracts exist, one for An Post and one for Fexco. What is the administrative cost of these contracts? I do not know if Mr. O'Kelly will give that figure if it is commercially sensitive, but I would appreciate it if he could.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor for that. On the post office deposit account for savings, I note that in 2011 it was €2.5 billion and it has risen to approximately €3.4 billion or €3.5 billion. Given the past year and a half we have had, does Mr. O'Connor expect that to rise higher than normal? What is his perception of the year ahead?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the post office savings bank fund and the investments therein, 61% of it was loans to the Exchequer but 15% of it was investments. What kind of investments are they? What is the mainstay of those?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. That is very clear. I thank Mr. O'Connor for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his contribution. Procurement issues arise time and again with all sets of accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned that some non-compliant procurement was in excess of €500,000. He also identified other issues relating to the prison and Garda Votes. Can he go into any specifics or any more detail on that? Are any of the organisations the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted on our work programme? Are we going to be engaging with them in the foreseeable future, over the next six to eight months?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Four organisations are non-compliant by more than €5 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General also highlighted the OPW contract that has been extended well past its sell-by date. Perhaps we can reconcile that with our work programme and see if we cannot bring those organisations in. That is not small change by any stretch of the imagination. It is a lot of money and we need to examine the position.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I bid Mr. Griffin and his colleagues a good morning and thank them very much for their attendance. I will take up the point made by my colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, on blackspots across the city and county of Dublin and the greater Dublin area. We need reassurance that the NBP is going to address those blackspots. Many consumers have contacted all Deputies, in particular in urban areas. They are being told by providers that their broadband connection is coming and if they sign up, they will be connected in 12 months but that is not happening. Whether it is a breakdown or an over-promise by certain providers, are these issues going to be addressed in the short term? It was stated that 257,000 premises had been surveyed. The Comptroller and Auditor General thinks there should be a separate subhead for this extensive plan and Mr. Griffin might come back on that as well to say if that is going to be incorporated into this year's accounts. We need reassurance that Dublin is going to be addressed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know it is extensive. It would be good if Mr. Mulligan could organise a deputation for Dublin Deputies on those issues, but that can be for another day. I will turn to the NCSC and staffing. A total of 20 new posts were announced in July, following the cyberattack on the HSE in March. That would bring the total number of staff from 25 to 45. What progress has been made on their recruitment and on the appointment of a director for the centre?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, when did the contract go back out for the director?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin. On the timeframe, am I correct that the post was advertised in mid-September or thereabouts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The only change was around salary and conditions. Is that not too long a timeframe given the sensitivity and urgency of this position? I accept that is the role of the Public Appointments Service and not Mr. Griffin. Given the national and international emphasis following the cyberattack on our health system and, potentially, as mentioned by Mr. Griffin, 3,000 attacks last year and, potentially, an increase on that this year, I would have thought the process of filling a position of that importance, as well as the recruitment of the other staff to bulk up this extremely important centre, would have commenced the day after the position was declined by the other person. Would Mr. Griffin agree?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct. That was signed off in July. I am wondering what-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the process, the position was advertised earlier this year, there was a further discussion around the post which ended in mid-July and it took until mid-September to re-advertise effectively the same post. This is not good enough given the sensitivity and scale of the attack on what is arguably our most important Department and potentially others.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. What is the interaction between the national security analysis centre - I do not want Mr. Griffin to comments on its role - and the National Cyber Security Centre?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Griffin. There are three landfill sites remaining. I commend the Department on its work in light of the European Court of Justice ruling in years past and the cost it brought to the State. In regard to the 494 unregulated sites, what is being done to not only clean them up but to monitor them? Some of them are causing extreme distress to local residents given their unregulated nature. I note the Department spent €6.1 million on the environmental fund to local authorities. How is that being monitored?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for the second round of questions and I thank Mr. Griffin for his previous responses. I will drill down into a few other elements in the time I have.  Mr. Griffin mentioned the trading online voucher. Some €21 million was spent in 2020 and 13,000 vouchers were awarded. I highlighted that figure because that scheme, and how quickly it was administered by the Department, was appreciated by so many businesses, as I am sure Mr. Griffin will appreciate. In addition, the work of the local enterprise offices in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the phenomenal roll-out of that programme and how well it was received by businesses, should not go unnoticed here today because it was invaluable to many businesses to get them online. I will return to the landfill issue. We spoke about it previously but did not have enough time. I asked about the €6.1 million allocated to the environmental fund to local authorities to support waste enforcement services anti-dumping initiatives. How is that being monitored by the Department? I can only imagine when the Department divested the landfill issue to each local authority it was probably a little weight off the shoulders but, ultimately, that needs to be monitored to ensure the fund is being utilised correctly and we are seeing value for money on that aspect. How is that being done overall by the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that just today?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Nugent. I understand the national waste collection permit office is run by Offaly County Council. Does that provide permits for the three active sites or is it for all 494 unregistered sites and every other site? He might just elaborate a little on that issue. I presume that also links in with the environmental fund to the local authorities.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note two elements in the report. The digital skills for citizens scheme had a saving of €2.5 million. That was the amount left unspent by that programme. Given where we are at with the pandemic, I presume that programme will resume shortly. I hope that €2.5 million, along with the new allocation, will be spent quite soon. In the same vein, €6 million was provided from the just transition fund and there was a significant underspend in that regard. There is a note in the report that finalisation of agreements in respect of individual projects faced delay. Has that issue also been resolved, because just transition is going to be more important as the years pass and we get closer to 2030. Will we be able to unblock the system to ensure we can get the money to the various projects that require it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will the €2.5 million that was saved be added to the current budget?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we might look into next time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They are agreed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is all right. Deputy McAuliffe sends his apologies as he has to chair the housing committee. I am also on another committee, so I will be jumping between the two.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gloster and his team for being with us this morning. In his opening statement Mr. Gloster said he had been in situ with Tusla for 24 months. I congratulate him on that, but I can imagine it has been a tumultuous 24 months, particularly for Tusla and all of the staff in the organisation with the work they do. We acknowledge that. Recently I asked two parliamentary questions about the number of front-line social workers in Dublin. There were 506 whole-time equivalents in December 2020. This fell by eight to 498 in June of this year. Taking into consideration what my colleague Deputy McAuliffe referred to about Dublin north city, the parliamentary questions also confirmed Tusla was in the process of recruiting 181 social workers in Dublin to the end of August, and 102 posts were listed as recruitment complete, 48 of those posts accepted, 31 were posts in progress, and I am not sure what happened to the remaining 23. Will Mr. Gloster confirm how many front-line social workers there are across the five Dublin Tusla areas currently, having recruited 102? Have the people in those 102 posts started?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that for the current year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume this is probably what happened with the 23 who are listed here. Would I be right in saying there are 600 social workers now in situ in post across Dublin or has that figure changed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those figures would be good to have, including the breakdown by area. Some of the figures were supplied to me in response to a parliamentary question recently, just about two weeks ago, so I have that. I also note from the figures that, as of December 2020, there were 1,169 staff members.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, and there were also 34 from agency. I might get to that later on in the second round questions because I am very limited for time. Mr. Gloster mentioned the 99 new recruits, which is very welcome. Based on a significant proportion of the staff working as front-line social workers, does Mr. Gloster feel there is adequate supervision and training, given that more than the 20% of the social workers are new starts? It would be a relatively high level of untrained staff. I am aware they have been academically trained, but in going into an organisation such as Tusla initially, is adequate supervision and training given to those new recruits?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course. I appreciate what Mr. Gloster said earlier about those who leave the organisation in under two years or under five years. Given the area in which some are working, be it the volume or types of caseloads, I appreciate this is going to be a challenge for some of them. I turn to more operational matters. In the accounts there is a cost of €34 million for administration, payroll and so on. Are social workers provided with mobile phones if they are working for the organisation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that because there are reports that front-line and duty social workers are not giving out their mobile numbers to individuals, or indeed email addresses. It is very hard, even for Members of the Oireachtas, to engage with the organisation. There is one email address and that is it. Will this be reviewed under Mr. Gloster's tenure as CEO?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that latter point, I can absolutely appreciate that. I do not want to demean it by any stretch of the imagination. Given some of the extremely challenging areas and situations in which Tusla staff are working, I absolutely can appreciate why the mobile phone numbers would not be readily available. I am talking about general run-of-the-mill cases. Are business cards provided to staff?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gloster for that. It would be helpful for us as a committee if Mr. Gloster would send us a note after this engagement today on the procedure around staff engaging with service users and how readily contactable they are.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Gloster will appreciate the people who are engaged with the organisation want to be able to engage, and if Tusla is ringing them, they would like to be able to call back the individuals who are dealing with them. I thank Mr. Gloster for that. In my last minute, will Mr. Gloster confirm if Tusla carries out quantitative and qualitative research on the outcomes of cases, particularly across various socioeconomic areas and communities, to ensure the quality of treatment of all children? Is that being done at present?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has that started?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Mr. Gloster to furnish any information he has on that to the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When was the last time the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces appeared before this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given that, I suggest that we add the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces to the work programme for the new year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Spratt, Mr. Clonan and their colleagues. It is good to see them again and have them before the committee. I will stay with the issue of transport. It is important that we as a committee not only look back through the 2020 accounts but also that we look at what is being planned. My colleagues spoke about MetroLink, DART+, the DART underground and other projects. Mr. Spratt or Mr. Doocey might come back to me on this. I know that this pre-dates Mr. Spratt's term as Secretary General. Over the past ten years or more, what has been done to progress the issue? We initially had Metro North. Now it is MetroLink. The greater Dublin transport strategy was unveiled two days ago. There have been changes to what was envisaged five or ten years ago, or even longer. What has been the Department's involvement, putting aside what the NTA does in guiding the planning process, in making this a reality and seeing this vision of MetroLink come to fruition?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doocey for that overview. He mentioned 2018 and costs associated with pre-planning and consultation. I accept what he is saying about it being a mammoth task. No one denies that. Does he have an indicative number for the cost of the revised plan? I know we have been here before to discuss the metro. How much has been spent to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doocey. I have limited time. In a one-word answer, when does Mr. Doocey expect to have a decision about the preliminary business case that has been submitted to the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doocey. Before I ask questions of Mr. Clonan, since I have limited time, I have questions about the search and rescue service. Forgive me if this question was asked in my absence. When reading the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I was struck by the fact that this dates back to 2013 and the 24 NVIS goggles that were purchased. That is expensive equipment and I heard the Secretary General say that we are the first in the world to use it in a private contract capacity. It has taken an extraordinary length of time to complete the training when one considers that one base has been trained since 2013. I do not know how that can be presented to the Committee of Public Accounts as good value for money when it clearly is not. The Comptroller and Auditor General has raised his concerns, and rightly so. Can we get a date for when all the SAR bases will be trained? Will that be done within the next 12 months?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Apologies for interrupting but-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the regulatory requirement that Mr. Clonan mentioned, how come one party was already trained in the absence of that? Am I correct in stating that one base was trained up in 2018 or 2019? How come that training proceeded and the training for the others has not? Would Mr. Clonan accept that this has taken a very long time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for allowing me in a second time. I wish to focus in on the Coast Guard with Mr. Clonan. I note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that 18, I think, vehicles were purchased. There were issues with procurement but I have heard what the Secretary General has said in that regard on reform around procurement, which is welcome. An issue I raised last May, of which Mr. Clonan might be aware, was one brought to my attention by members and volunteers from the Coast Guard about the use of the vehicles. He gave me a response at the time saying there are rules around the use of those vehicles. However, what I was saying at the time was that if members were allowed bring them to their homes it could increase response times. The reports I had at the time were members were leaving their home, going to the base, collecting the vehicle and then going to the scene. Mr. Clonan said correctly that not all members had to go to base. They could leave the vehicles at home. Has there been any progress on that? Given my limited time, he might send a note on that if he cannot come back to me immediately after this. My second question is for Mr. Spratt and concerns an area of great interest to me, namely, planning for major incidents, be they regional or national and relating to rail, road, sea or air. How frequently are the emergency services and other agencies engaged in training in these areas? I mention also co-ordination between local authorities. I am aware of one local authority where its disaster communications centre needs to be relocated from its main building. The officials cannot hypothesise about various incidents but given the potential scale of one of these incidents, how prepared are we as a State to deal with such incidents? I do not mind whether Mr. Clonan or Mr. Spratt come in first.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Clonan might send me a note on the use of the vehicles and maybe a breakdown of how frequent is "frequent" because I would like to know those exercises are being done being done biannually or whatever. They are really important.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Very good. I thank Mr. Clonan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for attending. I apologise for missing the opening remarks. I was in the Chamber. I apologise if I am going over old ground. I think the Department's response to an intense crisis in a short time was exemplary. I acknowledge the questions of my colleagues about reviews and ensuring that public money was spent wisely. I note what the Comptroller and Auditor General said a moment ago. I think it is right to say that the majority of businesses applied because they needed the funding to keep their companies afloat or in abeyance for the period of the pandemic. The feedback that I have got has been positive. The engagement by the Department was excellent. I will start from that basis. It is important that we review the money and the various grants.God forbid that we are in another similar situation and we have to respond quickly. We are obviously going to need to learn from the various situations and the grant systems we put in place. The local enterprise offices, LEOs, were excellent and the fact we had that local network and an ability to channel money out to businesses, some of which we had been engaging with already, was very important. I commend all the local authorities and other organisations on their work. In the Department’s briefing note, at part 3, on page 16, a point of interest to me was the funding in regard to the European Space Agency. How much is Ireland contributing to that? I note that, in 2020, 87 Irish companies were under active contract with the European Space Agency, representing a 45% increase in activity since 2016, which is very good to see. Some €13.3 million in contracts was won by Irish industry from the European Space Agency just last year. Will Dr. Quinn comment on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Excuse me, did I miss the figure of how much we have contributed to the European Space Agency? Is that an annual set amount or does it change?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I said, it is a point of interest to me. In terms of the restart grants, in particular the restart grant plus, does the Department have a timeframe for when the review might be carried out and how it might be carried out? Will it be done at a local level through the LEOs or through the funding organisations, or will it be done through the Department? When will it be done? My second question, which is not related to the Covid grants, is in regard to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspectors. This is covered in part 4 of the briefing note from the Department, which was very helpful and very informative. There were 10,295 workplace inspections and investigations carried out in 2020, with 9,135 inspections which addressed occupational safety and health issues. Given our discussion earlier about the number of premises that were not open during 2021, how many inspections were carried out? I know the HSA was involved in many of the health and safety checks in certain industries over the course of the pandemic.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before Dr. Quinn comes back in on the HSA question, where fraudulent or inappropriate claims have been made or found, what recourse is open to the Department in that regard and what would the Department do to try to seek the return of those funds?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be a fivefold increase, effectively, on the 2020 figures, given all of the various new inspectors that have been brought in or drafted in for the purpose of inspections during the pandemic. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Licken and her team. It is good to see many of them at the Committee of Public Accounts. At the outset, I want to refer to the breadth of her organisation. Ms Licken referred to it in her own opening remarks. I note some members have focused in on RTÉ and others on the European Capital of Culture 2020. I will touch on a number of other elements within both the accounts and other areas. The first I wanted to touch on was something I raised on the previous occasion we engaged, and that was around the television licence. Obviously, things have changed in terms of the pandemic and the need for inspectors to do other work. For how long were the television inspectors suspended from their ordinary work during the course of the pandemic? What impact did that suspension of television licence inspections have on the collection rate of 2020 and 2021? That will be my first question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, it is the first time I have heard them referred to as "sales". I do not know if the people who pay them would exactly classify them as sales. In terms of the money that has not been collected, is there a plan to try to collect that at some point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is a collection agent. Okay, that is fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Decade of Centenaries is something we have engaged previously on. In terms of the specific projects that the Department is engaged with, can Ms Licken give us an outline of expenditure to date on that topic?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am familiar with a number of those projects. Ms Licken is correct. It is very important and I recognise Ms Licken's Department's involvement in that. In terms of expenditure, do we have a figure of how much has been allocated or spent to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The witnesses might send us a note on it, if they would not mind.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course. They are hampered too. I accept that. I see Ms Banotti there. We spoke previously about Creative Ireland. Since we last spoke, I want to commend the work, particularly in the 24 DEIS schools on Fighting Words, that programme that was very well received, as well as the creative youth projects and others. It is important to acknowledge that work. Mr. Falvey mentioned the local authorities. It is important that there is good collaboration between the Department and Creative Ireland, and I thank them for that. Turning to the appropriation account, there is a note here about six contracts to the value of €578,000 for non-compliance. The majority of that was cleaning and other utility contracts. However, the sixth one relates to genealogy services in the National Archives of Ireland and it has now been re-tendered. Could Ms Licken outline what happened in that regard? There are nine other contracts as well but I will get on to that in a second.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I await the note on that. I apologise, as I have limited time. There is a note as well on the procedures and control changes within the Department as a result of Covid-19. Ms Licken specifically mentioned risk register details, and controls and actions needed to mitigate risks and assign responsibilities for co-operation and controls to staff. Has that process been concluded now? Is it correct that those new roles have been assigned within the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In my remaining time, I commend the work of the Department, specifically in the sports sector and the response to it, especially the €85 million that was allocated to sporting bodies. It is important that we acknowledge the quick response of the Department in a short period to the various organisations. I presume that I have used all my time, but I hope to get back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to come back to the sports elements because that is where we left off when I was last speaking. I agree with Deputies Paul McAuliffe, Alan Dillon and Colm Burke on the issues around large-scale infrastructure and other grants. If I heard the witnesses correctly, it was said that with regard to the grants for sporting bodies and provision of sports and recreational facilities, that underspend was as a result of challenges faced by the clubs in trying to spend that money but it is still earmarked for them and they are not going to lose the funding. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. With regard to part C, the capital grant programme part of the appropriation accounts, there seems to have been a significant increase in grants cancelled, from the figures for 2019. Can Ms Licken elaborate on the rationale for those cancelled grants?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is section C in the appropriation accounts on page 15. It is at subhead 2.9 on commitments.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department might come back to me on that or send a note.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To stick with the appropriation accounts, under subhead 2.4 on prepayments, there seems to have been a reduction in expenditure on the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030. Can Ms Licken explain what that is about and why there is such a dramatic reduction in that expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is not a loss.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is okay. In theory, the same money allocated to that programme is going to be there and it just has not been spent. Is that what we are saying?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wanted to get clarity on that in order to be sure. The recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General states: “The Department should put in place robust controls to ensure compliance of future grantees with relevant grant management and reporting requirements”. I note the Department accepts that recommendation. How is it going to be implemented?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Licken might revert to me on the question relating to the cancellation of grants, whether by note after the meeting or towards the end of the meeting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I confirm that I am on the campus. I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their attendance. It is good to engage with them again. I will touch on three topics: customs and excise; Brexit; and suspicious transaction reports. Starting with customs, Mr. Cody stated that there had been significant seizures of drugs and cigarettes in 2020 and 2021 and that Revenue was continuing its co-operation with the Garda and international organisations. Does he have a breakdown of the number of seizures of drugs and cigarettes across 2019 to 2021, be that at ports or elsewhere? I will ask a further question on this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	He must be the only person who is happy to speak about Brexit. I believe Mr. Cody gave figures for cigarette seizures of €32.8 million and €40 million for 2020 and 2021, respectively. Does he have a breakdown of the drug seizures? I believe that the figures Mr. Cody provided only related to certain seizures. Were they the global figures for those years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Mr. Cody does not have them to hand, that is fine because this is a specific matter. I just thought he might have them to hand. He might send on a note.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Harrahill. He might touch on significant seizures of other substances. He mentioned cocaine. The jump between the 2020 and 2021 figures is significant in light of the lockdown. While the world was looking at lockdowns, smugglers clearly were not. Instead, they were looking at opportunities. I commend the work of the customs agents and their sister agencies around the world in respect of these seizures. Are the majority of seizures at ports and airports or do they arise from follow-ups and raids? Mr. Harrahill mentioned equipment. The European Anti-Fraud Office of the European Commission gave a grant of €1.4 million and an X-ray scanning van was purchased. Was that in 2020 or 2019 and has that purchase resulted in a number of the seizures in question?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Harrahill for that. I am limited on time, but turning to the issue of Brexit-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, came into force on 1 January this year. Further changes in that regard will follow on 1 January 2022. What other engagement has Revenue had with SMEs? The last time Mr. Harrahill appeared before the committee, I commended him on the engagement that Revenue had undertaken with SMEs. Now that we are 12 months in, how are we engaging with SMEs and what are we doing in the context of the next tranche of proposed changes in January 2022?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Harrahill for that response. I might come back in later on with questions on the suspicious transactions reports, STRs.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will return to my previous line of questioning on Brexit. We were talking about the new changes coming in in January and the Revenue Commissioners' engagement with SMEs, which is very welcome, but I am wondering about the impact that Brexit has had overall on customs and excise duties and the collection of these since early 2021.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, I know.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The purpose of the question is to find out how much the Revenue Commissioners have spent on preparing for Brexit contingencies in terms of new systems. I am referring to what Mr. Cody was just about to ask Mr. Harrahill about.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a cost associated with that? The delegates may send a breakdown to us in a note if they do not have it to hand. Could I have a rough estimate of the expenditure, between when Brexit came into our orbit and now, on ICT, the new staff, online preparation, forms, courses, and changes to the ports? Is there a rough estimate as to how much it has cost the Revenue Commissioners?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses. It is good to engage again following our previous engagement in July. I will stay on the children's hospital and follow up on some of my questions in July. It is clear that we will not get a copy of the report. To an extent, I appreciate why not. When the committee visited the site, it was clear there were all sorts of claims, some of which were legitimate in theory because the design of the project had changed. I can appreciate that. However, Mr. Watt must realise that we, as the Committee on Public Accounts, are very interested, as I am sure he and other Secretaries General, as to what the final cost will be. As I have said previously, this is an essential project. We are in, whether we like it or not. We need a new state-of-the-art children's hospital. However, the Committee on Public Accounts would like to know even a guesstimate of costs.Regardless of what the report states, it would be helpful to give a ballpark figure to this committee, and ultimately to the public, to say how much the project may cost, subject to legal fees and other charges. Will Mr. Watt give an indication of what percentage of the project is complete?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What percentage of the project is complete?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So, assuming from that - let us call it €1.7 billion so far - that if there is about 40% of the project yet to run, which includes fit-out costs and everything else, would Mr. Watt agree it could be in and around €2.2 billion or would he even give a figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So Mr. Watt will not give even a guesstimate as to what he thinks the final cost may be?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the report give an estimate as to what the final cost would be?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can understand that but-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the basis that it is 50% to 60% completed, with the vast bulk of the construction and the outer skin of the building complete, which the committee saw, and obviously progress has continued from July onwards, was there built into the contract or was any foresight given to rising inflation costs? Were any materials or products pre-purchased at any point during this construction phase to try to bring down the cost, or are they being purchased at the point of need?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Watt is not sure and is not sure to the quantity either. I can appreciate that the board would probably have more detail on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I imagine they would. How often is the Department's engagement with the national children's hospital board? Is this monthly, weekly, or biweekly?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note from the documentation Mr. Watt supplied to the committee, which is helpful, that he gives an estimate of around 2024 as the completion date for this project. Does this include the two satellite centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware that one is complete but will they both be completed by 2024 or even before 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be helpful. Analysis was done by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. In an email to the committee, I note that Mr. Watt stated that the analysis was not in relation to the progress of the national paediatric hospital but it related to forecasting of critical paths and scenarios for the optimal completion of the project. What exactly does Mr. Watt mean by that? Is that in relation to the completion of the overall project or to the actual construction of the project, or both?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there anything that stands out to Mr. Watt from the analysis that he would like to share with the committee that he believes could be a big stumbling block to the completion, where it could be extended even beyond 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something I said to the hospital board and to Mr. Watt's Department in July. I believe that the scale of the project needs to be another element of explaining the sheer scale of this plan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have other questions but I will not get the time on them, so I will turn to the legal costs for the Department. With regard to the MDU refusal, there are departmental legal costs in excess of €1.6 million, which is extraordinary. Is that the Medical Defence Union? That case has been rumbling on for quite some time. What has been going on for longer, and is quite frightening from my perspective, are the legal costs for the Department in the thalidomide case. Is that the case that has been going on since 2010? I am conscious that there are only a handful of survivors left of this case. These are the second ever largest legal costs for the Department, as were stated in the 2020 accounts. Will Mr. Watt please clarify both of those items?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does that then explain the elevated costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can I just ask-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Watt clarify both figures for the MDU and the thalidomide case? Could he outline why the thalidomide case is the second largest legal cost of the Department at this point, given the case has been running on for 11 years or more?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Watt please clarify both figures that were in the 2020 accounts for MDU and the thalidomide case?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, the Department's legal costs.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the two headings, please. I think they have been broken down but I do not have the details to hand.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for being delayed. I will start with some questions concerning the opening statement. I apologise as well if some of these questions have been posed already. I welcome Ms Forbes and her team. It is good to see everybody again. Turning to the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General, concerning the additional funding provided to support enhanced programming during the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of the educational programmes that were broadcast. I commend them, because they were very informative and beneficial, given that schools were closed at the time and there was online learning. Those programmes were good productions and really well done. I praise the people behind those programmes. What other types of programming were funded from that additional allocation given in 2020? Regarding the licence fee, I noticed that roughly the same amount of money was collected in 2019 as in 2020. Ms Forbes said that there was a rate of a little over 15% for non-payment of the licence fee. What steps are being taken in that regard, or what kind of review of the process is underway, to try to reduce that figure? It has climbed year on year, if I am not mistaken. A similar figure is provided in Ms Forbes' opening statement concerning more than 15% of people who classify themselves as having no television, if I am not mistaken on that aspect. Moving to the mention that was made of the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure, what kind of percentage of RTÉ's overall spending is being spent on replacing that equipment? Those are my questions for now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The third part was about the percentage of spend on the replacement of equipment in RTÉ.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Forbes mentioned in her opening statement the large-scale organisational restructure being undertaken. I note the issues regarding gender pay. I understand RTÉ is participating in a working group with the Department as one of 500 other organisations. Specifically regarding the large-scale organisational restructuring in RTÉ and given the challenges Ms Forbes just spoke about in the media sector, particularly public service broadcasting, can she point to any other organisation similar to RTÉ anywhere around the globe that she would like RTÉ to emulate in respect of digital content, news and current affairs and other general programming, or is it a unique challenge here? If one looks across the water to the BBC, for example, and what has happened there with the licence fee and the challenges it faces, it is quite similar for public service broadcasting, but can she point to any other jurisdiction where she would say there is a good balance and a good mix and it is something she would like to replicate here?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is my time up, Chairman?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Forbes also mentioned in her opening statement, with regard to the casual contractors who were ultimately offered contracts, that 82 contracts were offered and there were 79 acceptances. Without naming anybody, can she give us a rough reason for the other three individuals deciding not to accept? I assume they were doing regular work and would have accepted a contract.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Forbes might send a note. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman. It is an important update to recognise given the discussions we have had with the OPW on this previously. If I am not mistaken, it was December of 2020 that we were told there would be a resolution to this early in the new year and, obviously, Covid-19 got in the way of that. It is in all our interests that this issue be resolved as soon as possible. It looks like there seems to be a resolution now, which is to be welcomed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance. It is good to have the engagement today. My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, had requested an engagement with the NTA specifically on MetroLink. As he will engage on that in a little while, I will not refer to it myself. I welcome the fact that the NTA has given us an update on the DART+ coastal south as well as the DART+ tunnel and the underground. On the DART+ coastal, I understand that Merrion Gates was mentioned. The NTA previously put forward a plan on that. I note in the update that the NTA is revising the plan. Does the plan include the flyover opposite St. Vincent's church? Is that still the same idea? What is the thinking around the closure of the Merrion Gates? Could the witnesses share that with us at this point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that there are limited options.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I know it is at an early stage. I welcome the update on BusConnects, albeit limited. There are several other routes and the network of spines to be rolled out. I would welcome an update on when routes 13 and 15 are proposed to be implemented and, equally, some information on the E spine. In the documentation provided to the committee it was mentioned that a total of 12 applications will be made for core bus corridors. However, my understanding is that there were 16 corridors in the initial consultation. Where have the other four gone or have they been amalgamated?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is the route 13. In effect, 15 has become 13.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Creegan for that clarity. I will turn to more localised issues in terms of the complaints procedure. Probably all Deputies on this committee are aware that there is quite a volume of complaints specifically about some of the private operators. In my case, the issue relates to Go-Ahead. I am aware of relentless and continuous complaints about bus services, between cancellations, late arrivals, and buses disappearing from schedules. It is really unacceptable. People cannot rely on the services, specifically the routes 17, 63, and 175. This is not isolated. This is practically daily. The response from the NTA has been quite poor. If I am being honest, I think that the response should have been more robust, because as Ms Graham said to previous Deputies about the PSO, there is an agreement in place and the contractors are meant to be adhering to what they say and that is not being done. What else can we see from the NTA in terms of improvements to those services?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will just cut across Mr. Gaston there. I am sorry, but this is not isolated to Covid. This is pre-Covid and it has continued. I am familiar with the 63 route. We could take this offline, but I can send Mr. Gaston a slew of complaints I have received specifically in respect of that route. The reason I raise the matter is because I and my constituents have constantly been sent the same response to our correspondence with the NTA. It is just not acceptable.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	But it has a lot fewer routes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry, but I have limited time on this. I just want to say to Mr. Gaston that this is not due to traffic, because the bus never appears. The bus is not in traffic. The bus never runs. The 7.15 bus on the 63 route does not appear. I have corresponded with the NTA and the response is not good. The response to constituents is even worse. At times, they do not get responses. I am just asking the NTA to have a look at Go-Ahead's 63 route. It is not acceptable. It is not working. People cannot get to work. The second issue I wish to raise is the service for students going to school. We have three routes locally – the 111, 59, 75 and at times the 75A. Could we look at synchronising those to service the students who are going to the educational facilities that ultimately those routes serve, be it going to school or coming home from school? Again, we have corresponded with the NTA. It is our only opportunity to engage on this. I ask the NTA to look at the timetable again, specifically in the afternoon for the 111 and the 59, because there are two or three primary and secondary schools that could avail of the service if it were a few minutes later. I ask the NTA to do that. In terms of the overall complaints, the NTA's report did not cover it, but Ms Graham touched on it earlier. Could the NTA please send a note to the committee on the volume of complaints, broken down by type of service, be it bus, rail or whatever? That will be of interest to me and it is something we need to be aware of. Does Ms Graham have any information on that right now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could Ms Graham give a flavour of what kind of numbers we are talking about?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Ms Graham have actual figures? Are there numbers?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That seems-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask Ms Graham to furnish the information to the committee, perhaps with actual numbers. I appreciate they are calculated per 100,000. It would be good to get the raw numbers. Several internal reviews were done and with the exception of July 2020 when it was done by McCann FitzGerald and November 2021 when it was done by KPMG, a total of 19 other internal reports were conducted by RSM. Is there a particular reason one company does the vast majority of the internal reviews?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	By the Department?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	By the NTA.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the few minutes I have, I wish to raise two issues. One concerns security. My colleague mentioned the fear, particularly of women, on public transport, but it also applies to teenagers, the elderly and other users of public transport services. I am aware that there are private security firms, which I understand are hired by the operators, if I am not mistaken. As the transport authority for the country, what is the NTA's view on proper security? I am not a fan of security. I prefer a Garda presence but that is beyond all of our powers here. I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on the matter as representatives of the NTA.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it a requirement that the operators have to pay for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Gaston for the response. The feedback I get is that the platform is not the most dangerous part. It is when they are on the actual transport facility, whether that is a bus, DART or a Luas. On a bus, the emphasis is on the driver to monitor what is happening on board, as well as maintaining safety on the road. I believe there needs to be a dedicated Garda unit to this, whereby its members can hop on or hop off all various types of transport. Has the NTA has engaged with the Garda on that? I hear what Mr. Gaston is saying about the good response times and the good response generally. However, I would like to know that the NTA is pushing for this. Finally, in my last few moments, I ask the Department about the taxi advisory committee. Has that been fully appointed now? Are all the nominees on it? Is it meeting?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our guests. I do not intend to go over some of the questions that have already been asked. I agree with the comments Deputy McAuliffe made about the perception of delays in the MetroLink project and what that means for its delivery. I remember a lot of publicity about the Metro green line. I also remember going to various public consultations. Can our guests tell us how much has been spent to date on that public consultation? How detailed were the plans in the end?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. Mr. Walsh might come back to us with a note on that. I would like to know the cost expended in recent years on that particular proposal. Is there a timeframe for the extension of the existing green line Luas to Fassaroe or Shankill We know the line will run south although we are unsure of where it will ultimately go. Is there a timeframe for when that will be decided and constructed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. There are passenger figures for the Luas on the TII website for 2004 to 2014 but the figures have not been updated since. Our guests might send the committee a note on that point because I would be interested about the capacity of the Luas and the numbers of passengers as we exit the pandemic compared to the numbers pre-pandemic. Some people may have got used to trams being less packed. We need to ensure we have the correct capacity. The passenger numbers would help so Mr. Walsh might send those on. I have a number of questions about the national road network. Mr. Walsh mentioned motorway service areas. I note the M1, M6, M9 and M11 are included. There are 25-year leases or contracts associated with those. As I understand it, they will come back to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and will be subcontracted out again. What plans are there for further service stations or service areas along the motorway network?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We might come back to that point. I would argue there are gaps in the network which is a cause of concern for people who travel. In the same vein, there are issues around charging points for electric vehicles. These all feed into a common and recurring theme, which is that people need those service areas. I have another question about rest stops and lay-bys, which came to me via a constituent. I ask our guests to review the safety of those lay-bys. That is a concern, particularly from a female perspective. The complaint made by my constituent was that she would not use lay-bys, even if she had to, because they are isolated and dark. There is no lighting, public toilet facilities or even something as practical as a tyre pump. Nothing is provided in those lay-bys and I ask our guests to review that as a matter of urgency. A landline telephone would also be useful. I am talking about the practical necessities for people who might be travelling on their own, who may be vulnerable and need those lay-bys. They are well placed but there is nothing in them. We need to examine that. I note that fines and evasions of the M50 tolls are mentioned in the report. I thank our guest for that documentation. How many evasions or non-payments of tolls have there been for the M50, in particular, over the past three or four years? Do our guests have those figures to hand?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. Mr. Masterson can send that information in a note to the committee. Does the money for fines go to TII, the Department or the private entity, the operator?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Masterson might send on those numbers in a note. I noted that TII's legal fees have doubled since 2018. The figures I have are €1.7 million for 2019 and €2.5 million for 2020. What was the reason for the increase in legal costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is for legal fees, is it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Consultancy fees have also increased. Is that for the same reason?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That illustrates Deputy McAuliffe's point about it being under way. I noted TII receives a quarterly report on road traffic collisions and fatalities. TII meets with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Garda. How frequently does TII meet with the Garda and the RSA? In their documentation, our guests referred to high collision locations. How are they dealt with and how fast are they dealt with?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Keeping with security, I notice that TII has provision for security on the Luas line. That is under its remit. I raised this with the NTA last week. We are aware of incidents on the Luas. While there is good security, they do not have powers of arrest or detention. The engagement that Mr. Walsh spoke about with the gardaí is important. I would argue that there is a need for a dedicated Garda transport unit covering all sorts of transport, including bus, Luas and rail. Has TII had any discussions with An Garda Síochána around deploying gardaí on the Luas, for example?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would ask TII to continue that dialogue. It is important that we see a change in policy there.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On national roads, is the N11-M11 upgrade being done through TII?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Walsh the timeframe or a cost on that? I know there is a preferred route.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh might send a note on that, please. The second option is the route and upgrade of N11-M11 junction.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, I know that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, I would like an update on its current status.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the Luas, I noticed there were 34 trams purchased at a cost of €22 million, although I do not know in which year. I know there are further trams due. I think they have been ordered, if I am not mistaken.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there sufficient capacity, then, for a return to pre-pandemic levels on the Luas system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are a number of issues in relation to the TII website. I ask the witnesses to look at that because there is some incorrect data on it. In the time remaining to me, with regard to the internal financial controls, I commend TII on alerting us to the issue with the contract for technical design services and non-procurement. I think the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced that in his opening statement. That should be acknowledged. The internal systems are working, it would appear. On Project BRUCE, better road user charging evaluation, I ask the TII to send a further note on that. On the board, the TII has responsibility for by-laws for toll schemes and a rail system. When was the last time those by-laws were reviewed? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was not in Mr. Walsh’s time anyway.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh might come back to us with a note on those two issues.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses. I apologise for being delayed. If I repeat some questions, I hope I will be forgiven because I did not hear them all. I listened to the opening statements and a few things struck me. To allude to something the Cathaoirleach was just saying, at the outset of this there was much criticism and much debate as to whether the State should get involved in this at all when the private sector was not. That was clear. There needed to be some sort of mechanism to roll out broadband, particularly for rural Ireland. I will get to urban heartlands shortly. If this had not been done, where would we be now in the absence of this framework? I know it is hard to ponder that but, realistically, where would be if this was not in place?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We all saw and experienced that during the lockdowns. We saw the need for connectivity of all different types, including multiple connections per home as children were doing school activities while we were all trying to work remotely. We even took part in this committee remotely, albeit from within these buildings. On what date is the 25-year contract due to expire? What was the start date and when is the end date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is NBI to continue to manage that for those ten years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To turn to the opening statement, Mr. Hendrick said 475 BCPs, including some in schools, have been installed. That is obviously very welcome. He also said that 54,500 premises are currently able to place an order via their preferred retail service provider. Are the 475 points included in that 54,500 premises?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are those 54,500 new connections resulting from the work that started in January 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see. That leads me onto the 154,000 premises constructed or under construction. These are also as a result of-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, that is fine. Mr. Hendrick also referred to 1,200 people hired. How many of those are direct employees of NBI?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course, there is always a spin-off. NBI employs 300 and then there are the contractors Mr. Hendrick mentioned. He also referred to subcontractors and listed off a good few of them. Is he saying the remaining 900 are contractors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does that include subcontractors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	All right. I just wanted to get a rough total of the number working on it. In his statement, Mr. Hendrick also mentioned NBI's co-operation and work with Eir and Enet. I commend him on his work for the islands. That is important. We are talking about rural Ireland and you cannot get much more remote than the islands. That work is essential because it will have benefits in terms of people returning to the islands and repopulating them and in sustaining communities. That is very welcome. However, there are also black spots in urban areas. Colleagues from across the House will know of black spots in towns, villages and cities in the areas they represent. There are several in my own area. I am not seeing the sense of urgency Mr. Hendrick has spoken about with regard to connections in those area. How are those issues going to be resolved? It seems that dealing with issues in urban areas would be simpler given that the services are practically outside people's doors. These providers, Eir, Enet and others, give commitments to connect these premises but it never happens. We are talking about years, long before 2020. People are losing faith. Ultimately, that is the engine of the economy. We need to ensure that there is good connectivity across cities and counties. What is going to happen there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We receive a lot of complaints about the lack of connectivity or high-speed broadband. How do we liaise with NBI to highlight those black spots? As I have said, there are plenty of them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Hendrick come back to us with information on the programme for those particular types of premises? That is probably the bigger issue. As a representative of an urban area, the existence of black spots is a big issue. I hope that NBI is aware of them all but, in case it is not, there needs to be a way for Members to feed in for various different reasons. I am talking about the construction of new homes and certain streets that seem to have been bypassed for the high-speed fibre roll-out. We need a way to inform NBI to ensure these are included in a work programme and that the works are ultimately done. I am still not quite clear on the timelines. I acknowledge that the timeline for each will be different because they are so sporadic but it is a matter of how they are going to be addressed and ensuring they are addressed. Mr. Hendrick said these premises may be done earlier than the projected date. I hope that is the case.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Hendrick for the clarity.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Doyle and his colleagues. It is good to have them here again. I thank them for the briefing material they have supplied. It has proven beneficial. I will focus on the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement initially. The Comptroller and Auditor referred to HAP. Many questions have already been asked this morning about that scheme. The 20% discretion of local authorities was mentioned and is important. From anecdotal evidence, that is the norm rather than the exception, particularly in my area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Given the property prices in the area, the council needs to rely on that discretion. I heard what was said of the review that is under way on that. That is welcome.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am surprised. I thought it would be higher. I thank Mr. Doyle. My experience chimes with what Deputy Hourigan said in respect of disabilities. I had a case recently involving somebody with a physical disability where the requirement for their accommodation differed from that of an able-bodied person. Therefore, the discretion was not sufficient to secure a property they required. In the review the Department is doing, I ask it to consider that element. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report found that 28% of HAP tenants were making the top-up payment in the first half of 2019. I do not expect witnesses have the figures today but they might send a note to the committee with figures for 2017 through to 2020 on the top-ups. The examination found the Department did not have information on the proportion of proposed HAP tenancies inspected or the results of those inspections. The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on to say the recommendations have been accepted by the Department and will be implemented, which is welcome. It will be of interest to this committee when that work is compiled. My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, referenced Housing for All. I note that Mr. Doyle's term runs concurrently with the introduction of that scheme. Mr Doyle's enthusiasm for the scheme and for delivering on housing is welcome and I thank him for that. Since we have dealt with HAP, will Mr. Doyle touch on RAS? Is it intended to continue to fund RAS for the next year or more?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Doyle have a figure on the number of tenancies in the State relating to RAS? If he does not have it to hand, he might send a note to the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the note he sends on, will Mr. Doyle break it down for the four local authorities in Dublin? I suspect RAS is more prevalent in urban than rural areas, but I await the figures. I turn to the major capital projects mentioned in note 2. It is 2.9.D, pages 18 to 20. There is a reference to 37 housing construction projects funded directly by the Department in 2020, of which projects 28 had expenditure in 2020, totalling €130 million.Is it possible to give us the number and types of units in those 37 schemes, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please do. That would be helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes please, that would be great. I turn to retrofitting. Since the announcement of the new retrofitting scheme we have all been inundated with queries. I am conscious that some years ago local authorities started retrofitting schemes themselves. There is increased funding for that. My local authority of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has made great progress on that. Some schemes are more challenging than others. It can depend on if they own the full block etc. Is there a percentage of how many units each local authority has commenced retrofitting on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Looking at the voids that were done and the extra funding that was given over the last two years, I presume that shallow retrofits are done at that point as well so therefore the numbers are increasing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, an issue we have dealt with for some time is the domestic violence refuges. I appreciate the comprehensive update on that. I note Tusla being the lead agency under the capital assistance scheme, CAS. I think the review and the interdepartmental working group that was established found there were nine local authority areas without any domestic violence refuge. Acknowledging that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not the lead Department, are such refuges the priority for funding first and foremost for the foreseeable future?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If we need to send the Department a note on that to give a list of priorities, we can do that. We are all too familiar, unfortunately, with the need and the gaps in the service.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	One of the items I did not touch on earlier was cost rental. The Department is estimating 2,000 new cost rental homes per year until 2030. I noted there were very quick turnarounds on the calls to the AHBs. There was one call on 14 December with a closing date of 5 January but the decision was made very shortly after that on 8 February. That is good because it means that there are quick decisions and turnarounds, and that the money is there. How many sites are currently earmarked across the State for cost rental? How many units are there in total? Do our guests have those figures?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As an AHB identifies a site or a need for cost rental, it can-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is very good.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all of our witnesses. I listened carefully to the opening statements, particularly from the Comptroller and Auditor General. Colleagues have already raised the searchable database and the 60% increase in its cost. Why was there no oversight group within the RTB to manage such a system given the level of expenditure involved?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given the outside consultancy and the internal project management arrangements that were put in place, was it not seen at some point that the costs were going to balloon?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the context of similar ventures and projects that the RTB is going to undertake, can I presume lessons have been learned on how to manage such large scale projects?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, and a costly one.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Let us keep an eye on that cost as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the RTB and the database, what analysis has been conducted to identify landlords who have unregistered tenancies? Has there been any analysis done to identify landlords who are no longer registered with the RTB? Ms Gallagher made reference to the quarterly reports undertaken by the RTB. Does that body of work include an analysis of landlords who are not registered or who are no longer registered with the RTB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From my experience, there is a bit of a lacuna here although it is not a policy issue that the RTB can address. If a legal entity is managing or letting properties, there does not seem to be the same ability in the RTB to pursue, monitor or enforce rules. Legal entities may change their names and continue trading under different names but are not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation that is meant to manage tenancies in a proper fashion. I know I am being vague here but I have written to the RTB about it, as has a concerned constituent of mine. My colleague in the constituency will be aware of a certain case. We need to analyse all types of tenancies to ensure that they can come under the remit of the RTB. I also want to ask about the extent of knowledge of tenancies and the sharing of information with the Revenue Commissioners under section 148. To what extent is that information being shared by the RTB? Is that updated regularly through the database or how is it done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I noticed in the RTB's financial statements that there was an excessively large increase in expenditure on High Court appeals. Why is that the case? In 2019, such expenditure amounted to approximately €38,500 but in 2020 it jumped to €264,720. Can Mr. Byrne explain that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was there a jump in the number of cases or did a particular case cause the jump in expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a significant rise.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that. I ask Mr. Byrne to send us a note on that because it jumped off the page at me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is an extremely large increase. Mr. Byrne said in his opening remarks regarding unregistered tenancies or even those that are registered, that if they are not in compliance with the RTB it can take action and pursue them through the courts or by other means. If he does not have the information to hand today, I ask him to send on to the committee data on the number of those types of cases that the RTB pursues on an annual basis. What remedies are open to the RTB if a landlord ignores, post-mediation, an adjudication from the RTB or health and safety recommendations relating to a property? Likewise, what remedies are available if a tenant has received mediation and ignores it too? What options are open to the RTB?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will focus on the financial statements and I have a number of questions about them, the first of which relates to customer contacts. The RTB spent €2.3 million in 2019. That reduced slightly to €2.2 million in 2020. The documentation notes that customer contacts costs relate to a third-party service company which provides customer contact through telephone, web chat and email, and administrative services to the RTB's customers.It seems a lot of money is being spent on outsourcing this service. I note Ms Gallagher's comments about the web chat, and I presume social media is included in this if it is not done in-house. Will Mr. Byrne outline what exactly this company is doing for that large sum of money?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it an annual contract?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sorry, I am just conscious of time. If I can, then-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The RTB spent €16,500 on subscriptions. I note it reduced during the pandemic. What are those subscriptions for?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Kelly might send a note, if he would not mind, please. I note the stenographer and translation headings. I can understand the reduction in costs of the stenographer, given the pandemic. In terms of translation, however, if the RTB's online services continued, why is there a reduction in translation services? Surely, I would have thought that would have roughly been the same, but it seems to be quite a reduction.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The RTB had 753 unresolved cases but it made no provision for them. I understand Mr. Kelly said the costs would vary greatly in those, but there is no provision made at all in the financial accounts in 2020. Is that wise given the discrepancy there could be for the RTB's accounts for next year? This is 5(b), section 14 on page 41 of the financial statements. It says the board had 753 dispute resolution cases awaiting hearing as of 31 December 2020. As the cost of the dispute resolution process varies greatly from case to case, no provision is being made for unresolved cases registered prior to the 31 December 2020.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would they normally be of that magnitude?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can just foresee as Mr. Kelly sitting here next year - I am sure he is looking forward to it already - accounting for the accounts and realising that perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General or we might highlight it, given there was no provision at all made for it. I do not think that is right. There should be a given provision for it in light of the number of cases.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to ask about the CDETB. The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a figure of a little over €2 million as regards non-compliance with the procurement rules. What kind of non-compliance issues did he discover?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Which can happen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That makes sense for the individual centres as well. I thank Mr. McCarthy for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Noted.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with the comments of the previous speakers. We must get more information anyway from it. The article was very serious and concerning, particularly the commentary that was used and quoted in the article of 13 February. In that vein, I welcome the clarity of this letter, particularly about the actual sum initially sought by the HSE, which was €35 million. While the agreed budget was €37 million, there was an additional €10 million allocated. In terms of the clarity in respect of recruitment, we know on this committee from across the country the challenge of recruitment that is faced by industry anyway, let alone in the public sector. It is helpful that this correspondence has set the record straight, but the tone and some of the commentary of that article are concerning to say the least.Therefore the letter itself should be published and we should seek further information, as has been requested already. Then we can take it up with the Department and the HSE the next time they are before the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to raise an area I had mentioned before, namely, the Dublin Dental Hospital. It is a long time since it was before the committee. I forget how long. Maybe the clerk or the Mr. McCarthy can say.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is what thought. I thought we had discussed that previously. Given the length of time, I suggest that 24 March be offered to them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, I had flagged it when we were going through the list of organisations last September or October. It was given the fact that it had not been here before. I take Deputy Catherine Murphy's point but we might look to see if it is a possibility if there space. The Chairman suggested Horse Racing Ireland. I have no problem with either but if there is a space, we should consider it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, there is an issue nationally. It is not just with it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said. It has a specific remit. I accept what the Chair said about the midlands. You could say that about any area in the country, in fairness, and it is the same for Dublin. I accept the Comptroller and Auditor General's points. If we were to include it with either the Department of Health or the HSE, in tandem as co-witnesses, that would be fine. We specifically put it on the work programme so that it was not forgotten and it is something that we should explore. The Comptroller and Auditor General is correct that it was about procurement concerns at the time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I do not think that we wrote to them. I think it was more that it was flagged at the time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I can do that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, that is fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good morning to Mr. Reid and his colleagues. It is good to have them before the committee again. I thank them for the information provided to date. I will start with Mr. Mulvany on the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening remarks concerning the annual report, which discloses an unaudited figure of more than €1 billion of current expenditure. This was spoken about earlier but I was not here at that stage. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated: [T]he appropriation account for the Vote does not report the out-turn for the mental health services, either in terms of delivery performance or of service-related expenditure. Reconciling the budget figures for mental health funding to the HSE's annual report spending figure for mental health is further complicated because of the different bases of accounting used. The framework of accountability for ... expenditure on our health services is therefore very complex.Is there a way to streamline that for next year so the committee can get a better picture of the expenditure broken down by section under the mental health heading?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am aware the HSE publishes that but I wonder if there is a way to streamline the process so that the committee does not encounter this problem again when it receives the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the operation and running of the HSE. Effectively, it says there are two different systems at work. The HSE is accountable to the Department and, ultimately, the Minister and that track is in place; however, as an oversight committee of public bodies, we need to be able to distil down the information, as we do for all public organisations. Is there a way to make sure the systems talk to each other? Will that happen in the next 12 months? Is that part of the plan for the HSE?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am familiar with that because we have spoken about it before. I am conscious of my time. I turn to the CAMHS issue. Ms O'Connor is welcome back to the committee. I heard what she said about Kerry CAMHS to the effect that it is specific to that area. I do not want to dwell too much on it because it is an active, ongoing case. However, it would be remiss of us not to touch on it while we are talking about CAMHS in general. I will only touch on items that are in the public domain. I understand from what Ms O'Connor is saying that there will be learnings from the Maskey report. How sure is Ms O'Connor and the HSE that it is specific to that area?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Internal oversight is obviously crucial as well. That is where the structures of the national office and the national lead - and I know that Ms O’Neill is on the call and can deal with this as well - are essential. Irrespective of the professional bodies that individuals may belong to, internal structures obviously failed here. They failed significantly over a number of years. I have met with some of the parents in regard to the Kerry CAMHS. To say that it is distressing is an understatement. It is very upsetting as a parent to hear of the issues that they have faced over several years in respect of so many different failings. To me, Dr. Sharma has done the people of Kerry and, indeed, the people of the country a great service. I commend him on his work because, without it, this issue would have rumbled on I fear. I take what Ms O'Connor is saying that it is isolated to that area. I hope that is the case, but I ask Mr. Reid to ensure that there is a full audit across the country, as the Minister has requested, in order to make sure it is just an isolated incident. What services and supports have been offered to the families, parents and, ultimately, children in Kerry since this issue entered the public domain? My information is that not much has changed, even with everything else that we now know. I hope that is incorrect and that it is not the case. If it is the case, I hope that the matter will be rectified as of close of business today because the families feel that there is a great deal of discussion going on in the public domain but that there is not a great deal of change within the HSE.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Audit aside, what supports and services are being put in place today for those families?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the clinical support team issue, I am glad Ms O’Connor raised that point and I am running out of time but I ask the Chairman for indulgence on this point. My understanding is that prescriptions have not been reviewed and that the clinical support team needed to be in place certainly prior to our guests' appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts. I ask that resources be deployed through the national office, from elsewhere if necessary, in order to ensure that the families are engaged with at the very least today or by the end of the week. I cannot fathom that if my child had been impacted since 2016, nobody would have made contact with me as of today to say that everything was going to be reviewed and supports offered. It is not just the children any more but it is their entire family who need the supports and services. I am not asking Ms O’Connor to comment on that but I am asking Mr. Reid, through all of the staff that he has available and are at his disposal, to ensure that there is a targeted approach to the families who have been impacted since, arguably, before 2016, but certainly since 2016 up to today, where we need to ensure that they get the services. I will leave it at that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will take up where I left off at the last round on the clinical support team. Ms O'Connor was discussing the supports that would be put in place for the families and children in Kerry CAMHS. She might send us a note on the updates when she replies to the committee. On overall mental health services, we recall the terrible attack on the HSE and Department IT services. Can we get an update on that? Mr. Reid said that approximately 80% of the HSE's services were impacted. What level of services have been restored? Are they fully back? Has the system been updated? Is the HSE satisfied with the security arrangements that are now in place?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is in the public domain that over the past couple of years there was old operating software on laptops. Has that all been replaced or are people within the HSE still operating on older systems?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Reid for that update. In the minute or so that is left to me, of the 73 CAMHS, I have three in the Dún Laoghaire area in the CHO 6 area. Recruitment has been a perennial problem, particularly for CHO 6 and for the south-eastern part of south Dublin. I ask Mr. Reid, and he can send in a note on this, on the increase in in-patient public beds and, indeed, the increase in private, in-patient beds for CAMHS and for mental services overall. I ask not just across the country, but specifically about CHO 6. I raised the issue of respite yesterday in the Dáil. In CHO 6, a respite house has been allocated to an individual after legal proceedings. That has left 88 individuals who rely on that property for respite in the lurch. That will take some time to replace. I would ask Mr. Reid and the relevant officials within the HSE to work with St. John of Gods to try to get a replacement, and other properties as soon as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	And mental services
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses, some of whom have been before the committee previously. They are very welcome back. In the time that I have, I will focus first and foremost on the Comptroller and Auditor General's remarks and opening statement and specifically on non-compliance in the context of Vote 21 and 24. A number of reasons have been provided for that non-compliance.I note that in Vote 21 there were 16 contracts totalling €15.5 million. Some of those projects went beyond the original contract date and others were rolled over. What procedures have now been put in place to deal with those issues?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Votes 21 and 24.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is good to hear that such progress has been made. Are any of the contracts under Vote 21 or Vote 24 long running? Are any of them contracts that have been in place for more than five years? I know Ms McCaffrey said some of those contracts have been put out to tender, which is good and probably best practice, but have any of those contracts been rolling for more than five years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms McCaffrey might come back to the committee on that point.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will turn to the Probation Service and consider an issue that we, as parliamentarians, engage with from time to time. Is there a written service level agreement in place between the Department and the Probation Service?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Sullivan. Our guests might be able to advise if there has been an increase in the referrals received by the Probation Service. Have our guests a breakdown of the most recurring offences that have been referred?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Do we have detail on which community service programmes are being engaged in that regard? I do not know if Ms McPhillips has that information to hand.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms McPhillips might send that information to the committee. There seems to be a lack of engagement between the Probation Service and local authorities on work that is required and could be done within the community. That could assist the Probation Service.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When does Ms McPhillips hope that piece of work will be concluded?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That community service aspect was patchy in the run-up to the onset of the pandemic and stopped thereafter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will turn now to consider compensation and legal costs, specifically table 6.2 in the document relating to Vote 21. I am struck by the number of claims that have been made by prisoners for injury and other actions involving prisoners. There are 445 claims of that kind and more than €2 million has been awarded in compensation. There are 107 civil claims for injuries received while on duty and other issues involving prison staff, which is a high number. There are 110 claims through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal arising out of injuries received by prison staff. Have our guests the figures for recent years that we could use as a comparison? Has that trend increased? The number of prisoner claims seems high. Have those numbers increased or decreased?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about the prisoners' claims? Does Ms McCaffrey have a percentage breakdown of the types of claims they are making? I heard what she said about sanitation but can she give us examples of other types of claims that are being made?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Please do. A percentage breakdown would be helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to pick up where I left off from the previous session. Much has been said about Thornton Hall and it is also referenced in the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments. I note the expenditure on the construction in Limerick, which is very welcome. What is being done regarding Mountjoy Prison? What are the plans to upgrade Mountjoy Prison?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the timeframe for that to be utilised?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It should be acknowledged that it was particularly difficult for the staff in the Prison Service during the pandemic. There were certain scenarios that could be accommodated and some that could not. However, I acknowledge the work of the Prison Service in engaging with both families and public representatives in that regard. That is good news about Mountjoy and the Dóchas centre. Turning to Vote 24, I have a number of questions on different headings and I will ask them in the time I have remaining. Subhead D3 is social disadvantage measures, and there was an underspend of nearly €1 million. Some of that was obviously down to Covid-19 but it also refers to certain projects for youth justice not being fully drawn down in 2020, related to the delays in establishing new projects. How are we getting on with that at this point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good. With regard to the Property Services Regulatory Authority, I found it very problematic during the pandemic, obviously because staff were working remotely. There is a slight overspend there of €162,000. Is that service fully operational again now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What about recruitment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, because that was an issue. What is the update on the gambling regulatory authority?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department is going to appoint a CEO-designate.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. In theory, how long is it before we expect to have somebody if the recruitment process is successful?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to know. The next two matters are linked. They are the funding for prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as well as funding for services for victims of crime. I note the services to the victims of crime increased during the pandemic for obvious reasons, unfortunately, as did the expenditure relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Can Ms McPhillips give us an outline of the expenditure there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is to be hoped that we will see an increase in that funding in the Department into the future because it is something that is really needed. The pandemic just exposed it. It does not mean it is going to go away, as Ms McPhillips knows. It exacerbated the problem.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ultimately, there is this clear sign that victims need these services. They availed of the services due to probably extreme duress and stress, but we certainly need to look at that. I will leave that in Ms McPhillips's capable hands.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Hogan and guests. I have a number of items that I want to touch on. As the previous speaker said, there is much to touch on within the Department. There are six specific items I want to ask about, namely, the NTMA; the EU budget; Irish Water; the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme; the Apple escrow fund; and legal costs - just to forewarn the Department officials. I will turn to the NTMA first and the long-term issuances in 2020 totalling €26 billion. I am just wondering about the overall cost of the €26 billion borrowed by the NTMA in 2020. Can the Department officials give me an outline on that? What is the current average interest rate of the NTMA borrowing? What oversight does the Department actually have on the primary dealers that currently have authority to issue Irish Government bonds? I will leave those questions to be answered now and then we will turn to Irish Water next.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the primary bond dealers, what is the oversight and how many are there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Directly. Okay. I am conscious of time and I have five minutes left. On Irish Water, the establishment cost was approximately €180 million in 2013.I note that in June 2020, amounts totalling €372 million were issued from the Central Fund to Irish Water under a loan agreement. What are the terms of that agreement and how much has Irish Water cost the Exchequer to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What were the terms of that funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That was really the point of the question. I turn now to the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. On the face of it, that scheme was extremely well received and it was really important to businesses. I understand the terms of the scheme included a maximum provision of up to €2 billion. What is the current value of loans drawn down under the scheme? How many applicants are estimated to have applied and how many received funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A total of 8,000 companies drew down loans. Does Mr. Hogan have an idea of how many applied?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Turning to the Apple escrow fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined a number of elements of this in his opening remarks, as did Mr. Hogan. What is the up-to-date position regarding the fund at the end of March 2022?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would there be an impact on the State if the fund continues to lose value?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I have only one minute left, I will not get to the EU budget. On legal costs, I note that costs of €439,000 were awarded and the Department's legal costs, at €510,000, were greater than that. There were two settlements paid out in 2019 totalling €24 million. I recently put in a parliamentary question about all the various State Claims Agency amounts between 2016 and 2021. I understood the Department had claims amounting to €134 million during that period. Am I right in saying there were five in 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The State Claims Agency gave a total of €134 million for the period 2016 to 2021. Regarding the Department's own legal costs, I note there were awards of €439,000 and the legal costs amounted to €510,000.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did that claim relate to this one single case?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I share the Chair's frustration. I am very pleased to hear the willingness of Professor Mey and the chancellor to publish the report. It is certainly some comfort to the committee. They can appreciate our insistence that we see it. When it is published, I imagine that we will be inviting them back to discuss it in more detail. I hope it is not a barrier to our discussion this morning. There is a lot to discuss and I have a limited amount of time. I welcome our witnesses. The big thing I would like to discuss at the outset is the city centre campus. Primarily I would like to afford time to the witnesses to take us through from April 2019 until today. I heard them speak about the investment in the site and their excitement for the university about this site. This cannot overlook the enormous cost of the site and the increased cost of the site from €3 million originally when it was valued by Limerick City and County Council to what was paid for it at more than €8 million. Will the witnesses take us through the reason for the increase in costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The KPMG report covers the information given to the governing authority and the subsequent process the university undertook to acquire the site.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would Professor Mey like to come in on that aspect?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Butler for that. The Opera site has not been mentioned yet. I ask the witnesses to talk about that site and when it was evaluated vis-à-vis the Dunnes site coming back into play which, Ms Harney said, was in 2019. Was the Opera site being considered prior to that? How advanced was that and was there expenditure made against the Opera site?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the Department's view of the expenditure that has been made? I note that the level of income from State grants has increased from 2014 through to 2020. Obviously there are questions about the pausing of some of those grants, which I might get to if I have time, but on the acquisition of this site, would the Department care to comment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would the Department not have a view on the process undertaken, given the fact that it is State money and given how the site was acquired?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the pausing impact last year's funding as well as this year's funding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The procurement non-compliance is in the region of €400,000. I also noted something strange in the accounts. The internal audit was outsourced up until 2019. Was that an historical decision? Was that always the case or was that something that was done over the past decade? Was it the same company or organisation that was conducting the internal audit for the university? Who was that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was the company that was undertaking the internal audit in place for a long period or was it changed every couple of years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that the university would send us a note on that because that raises questions for me. It is most peculiar to have an outside organisation doing an internal audit and it is certainly the right step that the university has taken in that regard. Speaking of steps being taken, I note that total legal expenditure is €926,000, which is actually lower than the figure for 2019. I presume this year's figure might be higher, given what we discussed earlier. There is a brand refresh and implementation fund of €87,000, which is higher than the 2019 figure, which was €85,000. The university in its opening statement highlighted the impact this whole saga has had on the reputation of the university. Is that fund for repairing some of the damage?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The university has a public relations fund of €33,000 as well as a separate fund for what Professor Mey has called a brand refresh. If the fund was for the implementation of the strategic plan that would be fine but it is specifically referenced as a brand refresh, which stood out for me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, does Professor Mey wish to comment on the legal expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, a sum of €926,000 is marked for last year and €1.04 million for 2019.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I might come in again later, if there is time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will stay with the issue of the deposit on the house in Dublin. Corrective action was taken, which is good. Has there been an investigation to see if any other properties were bid for, purchased, had deposits paid for or anything else that is outside the scope of Limerick city and its environs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	For a while there I was thinking it was more like a property management agency than a university. I want to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General a question and I will return to that non-compliance amount of €407,583. What did that relate to and what corrective actions can he see that have been taken on the issue of non-compliance?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to protected disclosures, which there have been a few of. To ensure there is a confidence within the university to bring forward disclosures, what remedies or improvements has UL made to ensure there is protection for those individuals who feel they have information to come forward in the university?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Moloney and I congratulate him on his appointment. I have been listening to colleagues’ questions, some of which I would like to touch on again. I will go back to the issue of secondment of people who are from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and who are ensconced into other Departments. One was referenced by Deputy Murphy earlier in relation to the Department of Health. I think Mr. Moloney said the figure was 17 in his own Department and that 19 had gone out-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know they are across other Departments and other agencies. Is it the practice of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have colleagues from its Department based in other Departments for the purpose of oversight of annual expenditure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate and know that. It is not in every Department.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is based primarily based on the annual accounts and the Department is monitoring their expenditure from the outturn versus what was estimated in the Vote or in the budget.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those Departments that have a high expenditure include the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection. What other ones are there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will turn to the 2020 Vote 11 accounts and specifically to note 1: operating cost statement 2020. In one section, Mr. Moloney outlines the expenditure borne that is elsewhere, which includes notional rents. That figure is static between 2020 and 2019. Could Mr. Moloney outline what that relates to, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is on page eight, just for reference.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is why it is a fixed rate.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was going to ask how many properties there are. Is Mr. Moloney saying that it is only those on Merrion Row?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with Vote 11, section 2.3 deals with other debt balances. I assume that there are recuperable expenses. There are salaries, travel expenses, travel pass expenditure and other debit suspense items. What struck me was the difference between the 2019 and 2020 figure under recuperable travel pass expenditure. Was that primarily down to Covid-19 and to fewer staff claiming for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Again, staying with Vote 11, on page 14, there is the postal and telecommunications services from within the Department. There was astronomical outturn, when compared to the figure of 2020. The provision for 2020, I presume again was in relation to Covid-19, was €22,000 and yet the outturn was €14,000. I presume the annual running of that line figure is approximately €200,000 per annum, based on the 2019 figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would explain the difference.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That explains that. Let us turn to the issue of the new office. I have a question on it. Some 30% of the OGCIO’s programme expenditure related to pay and that is understandable. Its next largest expenditure was on ICT services, which accounted for approximately 68% of overall expenditure. Is that an initial set-up cost and a once-off or is there an ongoing reliance on expenditure for ICT within that new office?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Since its establishment in 2013, would the ICT spend be that high on a year-on-year basis?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That explains that. I thank Ms O'Donohue for her response. Colleagues asked questions about pension payments. The witnesses answered some of those questions on superannuation, which is welcome. It was mentioned that there was a 3.9% increase in the number of pensions year on year. I presume that will increase further in the coming years. A colleague referred to pension numbers not being accurately predicted year on year, although I know it is difficult to do so. How will expenditure grow over the coming years? Obviously, there are estimations, so what will be the extent of growth in superannuation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That puts it into context. I noted the reference to ex gratia pension payments for widows and children. The amount decreased from €303,000 in 2019 to €253,000 in 2020. What number of ex gratia payments have been made?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Pender have an approximation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Per year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Pender.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their opening remarks. I would like to touch on a number of areas. I will be brief in order to get through them in the limited time available to me. To touch on the issue of assessment of needs that we were discussing a little while ago, the redesign in the HSE that is being spoken of is welcome, but a definitive timeframe for when that will be published would also be welcome. I heard Ms O'Connor's remarks about the focus on the child's needs, which is right and proper. Does she have a timeline for when that will be complete?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We can touch on that when we meet again.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A constituency colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, raised disability services too. We are fortunate that we have services in CHO 6, with St. John of God, St. Michael's House and a number of other service providers. That is excellent but there are delays in simple resources and facilities. One involves a child who has been waiting for over six months for a wheelchair. It is not anything bespoke. It is a standard wheelchair. There has to be a better turnaround time. I assume there was a good tendering process, with these being brought in and delivered to families who need them. Is there a reason for such an inordinate delay for something as simple as a wheelchair?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From the perspective of a family of children or adults with disabilities, there is no clear pathway. It seems to be a maze for those families. We need to clear a pathway. There should be a helpline to ring and information about the services and entitlements that people will be afforded. If something niche or bespoke is required, people understand that there will be a delay. I cannot understand such a delay for such a basic necessity as a wheelchair. The answers I have got about why there is a delay have not been clear. I will liaise further with Ms O'Connor about that. To me, it points to a bigger problem. We have an issue with residential care and respite places in CHO 6, which I understand happens nationwide. How are we progressing with purchasing and staffing properties for residential places? I understand the issue with staffing extends across the country. Mr. Reid said that resources are not an issue for staffing and recruitment, but getting people into those positions is the challenge. How are we faring with residential and respite care?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms O'Connor might send a note about that. As she said, respite and residential care are not aired enough. I would appreciate an update on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am chair of the all-party Oireachtas committee on diabetes. I am aware of a framework being discussed by the HSE and providers of certain continuous glucose monitors, CGM. It is taking a long time. There was a previous attempt in 2017 and 2018 to get approval for a particular monitor.That has an impact on those with diabetes. I do not expect Ms O'Connor to have the information right now but if she could come back to me on that, we need to have a definitive timeframe, given the fact that it is at least four years in discussions with the HSE, and also on the LTI list. The supports and adaptations for the CGM monitors also need to be included on the LTI list.  As I am conscious of time I will turn to the value for money aspect for nursing homes. In the documentation it states the cost of providing service in a public nursing home was two-and-a-half times the cost in a public nursing home. What is the update now that report has been published? What will we see in changes of the funding model? What is the thinking within the HSE on the Value for Money report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is by the end of the year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have one minute remaining for three questions. In regard to the waiting lists and the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, in April a total of 7,221 patients were on some form of public waiting list to be treated or assessed by a consultant. How is the NTPF assisting in those figures or is it not assisting with those numbers? Also, the last time the HSE was in, we spoke about the cyberattack. It is obviously of huge interest to everybody that we would be well prepared and resourced to head off any other such incident. However, the recruitment of the head of the national cybersecurity centre, NCSC, was outstanding at the time. I understand that the salary had to be changed and another offer made. Where does that stand now?  Finally I notice in Vote 38(F)(1) on page 9 of the appropriation accounts for 2020 there was a reduction in expenditure in regard to the payments for those affected by thalidomide. Why was there a reduction in that? Hopefully that issue and the cause for those thalidomide sufferers is coming to a resolution after, not years, but many decades.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Watt.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Reid's-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was just on the issue of cybersecurity from the Department's perspective, that is all. I hear what Mr. Reid is saying about the HSE internal situation which is welcome. Does Mr. Watt have any further update in terms of the NCSC?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. McCarthy and thank him for the briefing information provided in advance of the meeting. I will stick with Oberstown to start with because Deputy Burke was speaking about it a moment ago. It was mentioned that there is capacity for 46 inmates and is it fair to say they are the higher end of the more challenging youths, as detention centres go in the State? Would it be classified as that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. McCarthy mentioned funding relating to Oberstown, which increased over the past while. I think €24 million was expended under the programme in 2020. He also referred to education, training and other supports for those who are on licence there. What kind of uptake is there in that centre for the services that are there?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the percentage uptake in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be helpful. On the €24 million, what was done? Was there an extension or refurbishment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was current funding, okay. In terms of capital funding, what was the spend?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was that €3.8 million an increase or decrease on the 2019 figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. McCarthy might come back to us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy. Our time is limited. On ECCE and programme B specifically, in the Department's appropriation accounts, under the heading "Agency services", it is stated that Pobal administers that particular programme. There was an advance of €518 million to Pobal in relation to note 6.1. What was that advance for?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was €518 million advanced to Pobal in 2020.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Correct.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was the change in the Department? Was there a change and transfer from it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. I thank the Mr. McCarthy for that. On procurement compliance, there the 151 contracts spoken about earlier and €91 million relating to the provision of international protection accommodation. I hear what he said about how we are kind of at the upper end of that budget for this year given the numbers and that is excluding the Ukrainians who are coming into the country. Then there was one contract for €29,000, in excess of that, for the commission of investigation and one contract in relation to €74,000. I heard what was said as well about reforms and note also that "Audits are conducted to DPER/CIIA standards" and "The internal audit function is reviewed periodically". How often is it reviewed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would it be annually or biannually?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that Mr. McCarthy come back to us. Are the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are on the line be able to come in on how often that review is done of the internal audit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is stated that the audits are conducted to Department of Public Expenditure and Reform standards, and not by that Department. Pardon me. That is fair enough. I ask that Mr. McCarthy come back to us on that if he would not mind. I noticed there were a number of legal cases in the information. It is in note 6.2, which is headed "Compensation and legal costs". I noticed there were 20 injuries in the course of work in 2020. Were they cases that were just taken and that arose in 2020 or were they ones that were paid out in 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, and obviously cases take different times.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is annually. I thank Mr. McCarthy. Under "Other claims" there are three. What do they relate to, as they are claims by employees, if they are not injuries in the workplace?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. Then there are nine personal injury claims and a challenge to the children's referendum that dates back to 2019. What was that relating to?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It took that amount of time, until 2019, to deal with it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Wow. Okay. In the last few minutes I have left, I have another question on the accounts. There was funding from the EU under a heading that was highlighted. It is "EU receipts", with €6 million being an estimate of what was to be received in 2020 and the outturn €5.4 million in respect of the asylum, migration and integration fund. Is that separate to the fund we were speaking about earlier when Mr. McCarthy said referred to asylum or international protection? How does that EU receipts funding differ from what we were talking about earlier in terms of us being under pressure with our current budget for 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given we were talking about the IPAS system and the funding for 2020 and the current year. As well as that funding in 2020 for the EU receipts, which was nearly expended, it is fair to say - there was €600,000 shy of the estimated provision for it - would it be fair to say the money that is allocated to our refugee and asylum programmes is under strain in the current year, with everything that is going on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the intervention programmes for children and young people. Given the year that was in it, there was a shortfall in expenditure in 2020 of €922,000. There were delays in projects associated with expenditure. Have those projects been subsequently funded to the maximum and are they back on track now?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is subhead B8, which relates to intervention programmes for children and young people.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. McCarthy might come back to us on that. It would be really important to ensure that cohort of children and young people are not losing out.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair. I welcome Mr. Doyle and his colleagues. It is good to have them before the committee. I will begin by referring to the issue around NOAC, as well as the local authority audit committees and the LGAS. Specifically, what is the difference between the LGAS and NOAC? Do their processes run in parallel to each other? How do they interact with the Department, for example?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a few questions specifically on Ms Quinn's area of expertise. It was said that the National Oversight and Audit Commission hosts oral hearings from time to time. I appreciate that is an outside body but could the witnesses furnish the committee with information on that? If not today they might be able to send a note afterwards. How many oral hearings did the commission hold in 2021?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Quinn. How does a scrutiny meeting differ from an oral hearing?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I had a look at some of the reports on the website which, in fairness, is laid out very well. Some of the issues, as Mr. Doyle has said, highlight governance or compliance issues. Looking at some of the council reports and the audits of the Local Government Audit Service, some of the issues in local authorities are recurring year on year. Some relate to compliance in tendering and so on and some are internal issues. How does the Department interact and engage with those local authorities on those specific issues? Am I right in saying there is a specific section within the Department that liaises with the local authorities on audits?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would take exception to that. With a number of those reports, particularly around tendering, nothing needs to be unwound; it needs to be implemented. We are talking about a sizeable amount of public money. What is being done, either by the Department or by the audit section, as part of a carrot-and-stick approach to ensure local authorities comply on issues that are clearly being repeated year after year? The problems my not specifically relate to the same contracts but there is a lack of compliance in the organisation. What can be done about that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	These are quite specific.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What does that entail?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If a local authority were non-compliant year on year, say to the tune of €1 million, could the Department withhold funding from the Local Government Fund? Is that option open to the Department to try to instil the seriousness of non-compliance in local authorities?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Has that been done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the witnesses to take a look at that issue. Considering Mr. Doyle's recent conversation with the local government auditor and audit section of his Department, he might look at that for the next time we discuss this issue. I would like to ask Ms Quinn about the Public Appointments Service process. There are a lot of vacant positions, as the witnesses will be more than aware, across the local government sector. I have heard reports that it is taking months to fill those positions but that is not because of a lack of applicants. The applicants and panels are there. It is all taking too long to deliver. What can be done in that regard? On the local property tax, do the witnesses have figures for the number of deferrals being availed of across the country? If not, I ask them to send them on. I would like to know the percentages and numbers of people availing of a deferral of the payment of their property tax. Since new homes from 2013 to today are now liable, maybe they could include those figures as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It needs to be quicker. Where there is an applicant and a process, it is taking far too long.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Donoghue.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Doyle.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our witnesses. I send my best wishes to the Secretary General. I will start with the school building programme. I heard Mr. Loftus say that 700 active sites had been acquired since 2021. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Loftus outline for the committee the number of stages of acquisition, planning and, ultimately, construction? How many stages are there from site acquisition through to construction?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That may be a matter for another question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	All I wanted to know was the number of stages. Mr. Loftus referred to five stages. Is that for acquisition and construction or acquisition and planning?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	At times, there does not appear to be a continued focus on the various stages. Other Deputies have raised issues in their constituencies. I represent Dún Laoghaire and I am aware of a particular school which has been in prefabricated units on-site since 2005. The State pays for the upkeep and maintenance of the prefabs annually. About three years ago, one of the prefabs was condemned. We thought that was wonderful because the prefabs would be moved, but instead the State purchased or rented another prefab. The school has been on this temporary site for about 27 years, although the Department owns it. Mr. Loftus outlined five stages, which sound quite simple, but I know it is complex. The Department probably selects land owned by the council or State land first and then if that is not available, it seeks to acquire land, if possible. I am sure Mr. Loftus will agree that 27 years is a long time to spend in prefabs. It has an impact on the school, although not on the quality of education, which is excellent. It has an impact when people visit it. When will the prefabs be replaced or when will there be a permanent building? I will come back to that in a second. The Department had capital expenditure of €4.1 billion in 2021. Some €165 million was spent on temporary accommodation, according to the briefing note supplied to us. Some €29.4 million was spent on renting temporary accommodation. Does €165 million include the €29.4 million or is that in addition to it? I know those are not all prefabs and that temporary accommodation could include other things. Do the witnesses have a figure for how much the Department spent on prefabricated units in the period we are discussing, which is 2021? Does the €165 million for temporary accommodation include the €29.4 million for temporary rental accommodation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. Of the €29.4 million, I am not saying that all of that is in respect of prefabricated units that are there for long-term accommodation but how much of it is reoccurring? I mean prefabricated units that are being used on a continuous basis as either a school or an extension to a school. Does the Department have that figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I figured that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. That review is helpful and it is good to know it has been done, particularly from the perspective of this committee. What about the 8% of that figure? Where do those schools stand?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is all very important. The demographics of those areas can speak to why there is spare capacity. I ask the Department to look at the building I mentioned from 2005 and follow up with a detailed note please. The roll number is 20056P. Finally, there is a small extension that began in a school with the roll number 19258U. It started in August 2019. It is overdue by 12 to 14 months. The school has tried to engage with the Department and the contractor. Principals are becoming project managers here. Many of them do not have the time, resources or the skill set to do this. Yet the Department is paying a contractor to do work but the contractor is not on site. In such instances, what can the Department do to ensure the contract is done and dusted and that ultimately kids can go into that classroom? What happens then?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair. I might come back in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Walsh and his colleagues. It is good to have them before us again and it is certainly timely. I will take up from what Deputy Carthy touched on regarding the 2020 expenditure of €8.3 million in legal fees. That was significantly up on the 2019 figure of €3.4 million. However, the number of cases is down 12% on the 2019 figure. What is the difference? What accounts for more expenditure yet a 12% reduction in the volume of cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Legal cases, not ordinary cases.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are they all JRs or are we dealing with other types of legal case? Is it an 80:20 split between JRs and other types of legal cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What are the exact numbers for 2019 and 2020 judicial review cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh said about half the expenditure was the board's legal fees and the other half was costs awarded against it. He said cases have become more complex, but what has the board done to try to protect the taxpayer?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh made that point earlier. In terms of legal costs, does the board have an in-house legal section or does it outsource that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are those legal firms tendered out-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----and reviewed? How often?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Turning to two other items, Mr. Walsh mentioned the inspector reports. A number of these are overturned. Despite the inspectors' views the board takes a different decision. Does Mr. Walsh have a percentage of how often that is done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was that 2020? Was the figure the same for 2019?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the board's decisions and attendance at the board - this has cropped up in the past and we dealt with it before when you were here - what is the quorum for the board to make decisions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the usual attendance at a board meeting?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To me, a quorum is the minimum on which to operate. To my mind to operate on a minimum and have several meetings running concurrently would not be satisfactory given the outcome and certainly the position Mr. Walsh is in today. Is that going to be reviewed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That might be something for discussion later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In my remaining minutes I will turn to the organisational review of 2016, all 255 pages of it. It started in July 2015 and was published in 2016. I am quoting from the senior counsel's own statement that says "The Review Group was set a tight timeframe set by the Minister for carrying out its tasks. Sometimes that is the best way." Obviously only 36 of the 101 recommendations have been implemented. Why is that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Walsh know how much that report cost?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Was it paid for by the Department? Does the Department have a cost of the report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be helpful. The Plean-IT system started in 2014. Is it complete yet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That links in with the local authorities, is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the cost to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair, just one final question. What was the cost of that, to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Deputy is okay, she was on a roll. I will return to Plean-IT. Mr. Walsh said earlier that it was €5.4 million of cost that has been running ongoing since 2014, yet it is still not complete. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the estimated cost of this project?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So, we are a little over double that amount.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, as Mr. Walsh has said, it is evolving. Of that €5.4 million, how much of that amount is for the consultancy element of it and the ongoing maintenance of that particular IT system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is about 80% of the costs-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. That explains the breakdown of it. I have another question to ask in my remaining minute. With all of the changes between the strategic housing developments, SHDs, that were brought in and the strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs, there was a requirement - of which I was critical at the time - that An Bord Pleanála was not equipped IT-wise for those changes. The interface between the public and An Bord Pleanála lacked a lot of improvement. It is good to see the changes on the website, which I have witnessed and which are important. The cost, however, is quite eye watering from my perspective. Yes, there is some consultancy in that but I ask that An Bord Pleanála would be conscious of that going into the next year. I would like a breakdown of the oral hearings. Earlier I asked about the inspectors' reports and how often these are overturned and overlooked. It seems to me that it is a shot in the dark whether or not an application goes to an oral hearing. What are the criteria for the board making a decision about an oral hearing? Is the quorum for that decision equally two or three members? I believe this would have ramifications if an oral hearing is granted.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Walsh have a number for the oral hearings granted in 2019 or 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The anomaly for me is that if the inspector's report is to grant permission but there is also a need for an oral hearing, where does the quorum or the board sit on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is the first question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to clarify that the secretariat will continue to follow up the items, even if we do not flag it. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Reid and the officials. I thank them for coming in. I am not sure if this will be his final appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, but I thank him for the information he provided and all the engagement we have had in the past couple of years, particularly during the pandemic. At the time, he gave significant time to this committee and other Oireachtas committees, and that was appreciated. I will turn to the issue of CHO 4 as it is specifically on the agenda and Mr. Fitzgerald is here to answer questions. How many children have been involved in the review in CHO 4, particularly in respect of south Kerry, but also in north Kerry and the rest of the CHO area? On the most recent occasion Mr. Reid was before the committee, I asked what actions had been taken to engage with the affected families, and the children in particular, some of whom are now adolescents, to review their medical needs and mental health needs. Has that work been completed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that, but how long did it take for that process to start and the engagement to happen? We are talking months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for that. In terms of the children's medication and an assessment of need for each family, has that all been done as well as liaising with each of those 240 individuals?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the assessment include medication?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for this clarification. I now want to turn to the OECD report that accompanied the briefing documents. There is some very good reading in it. We had an extremely successful vaccination programme with the co-operation and support of the general public. It is stated that 70% of the population received two doses. Does Dr. Reid have an update on the second booster? What is the uptake of this? How is the roll-out going?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does this include the older cohort as well as those at risk? There has been an advertising campaign for those at risk. Mr. Reid said there has been a slower uptake. Does he have a rough percentage?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The HSE is right to look at other facilities such as pharmacies and GPs to support the roll-out programme and make it easier for people to access it. We do not know what the winter will hold. Is there a possibility of engaging outreach services for larger employers where employees will be based? I know it was not possible during the pandemic for obvious reasons but is this being considered? Will the advertising campaign be used to try to encourage people to go to vaccination centres and other healthcare centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the witnesses to forward the table. It would be very helpful to the committee. On the previous occasion we spoke about this we discussed cybersecurity. The attack was in May 2021 and in November 2021 the HSE sanctioned taking on a chief risk officer. Has this role been filled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The consultancy firm is liaising.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is ongoing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the annual report risk No. 13 specifically highlighted the cybersecurity ICT systems and infrastructure. With regard to the spend I hear what has been said about the roles being filled but they are individuals and the leads in this area. What other issues and commitments has the HSE made to ensure its ICT capabilities are up to scratch given that on the previous occasion we engaged on this I raised the issue of ICT, laptops and software? We were buying patches for computers. One year later have we moved on from discussing this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. I do not want detail.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the HSE working towards having a more integrated system in the five to seven year plan?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Mulvany. I want to stay with the National Ambulance Service because it has formed the main part of our questioning today. My question may be most appropriately directed to Professor O'Donnell. In the Dublin metropolitan area, there is obviously cover from the National Ambulance Service as well as the Dublin Fire Brigade. However, there is an anomaly in CHO 6 or the south-east area, where there is no paramedic cover by the Dublin Fire Brigade. What is being done to rectify that particular issue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In CHO 6, the south-east area.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That works really well across the rest of Dublin, but there is an anomaly in the catchment area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown where there is no additional cover. If a person suffers a stroke or is involved in a car accident or, God forbid, some other sort of incident anywhere else apart from the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, they have dual cover under the NAS and the Dublin Fire Brigade. Both resources can be called on at any given time. I understand this has been rumbling for a number of years but where does the HSE stand on resolving this? There is not the same equitable service in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area as there is elsewhere in the Dublin region. It is an anomaly that has been ongoing for a long time. Does the HSE have an update on this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That worries me more now that Mr. Morton said that the ambulance base in Loughlinstown will be relocated. That will leave the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area with one service whereas the rest of Dublin enjoys two services. As I do not have enough time to delve into it today, I ask him to send on a note on the future plans for the NAS in the Dublin region, specifically the south-east area. I refer to an issue relating to the 2021 statement that also relates the 2020 financial statement, which is the storage of protective suits. The figure of €1.25 million spent on the storage of those suits jumped out at me. I understand from reading the documents that some of these suits will not even be used. Why was the HSE not able to store those itself? Why would it incur such a cost?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with that point, Mr. Mulvany mentioned ventilators. The figure of €42.5 million was provided for the procurement of ventilators, and according to the financial accounts of 2021, I understand €12.1 million of that amount was recovered. How is the recovery of that money proceeding?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a little over a minute left and will have a rapid-fire question section. I refer to the annual report and appendix No. 4 starting on page 100. The second MRI machine for St. Vincent's is extremely welcome and it is good to see it included under the projects completed and operational by the end of 2021. I was struck by a completion delay until after 2021. The report refers to a lease agreement for a primary care centre. My understanding was that the HSE owned many of the sites in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6 area, but it states that it is by lease agreement on page 102. I do not expect Mr. Mulvany to have that information to hand, but he might furnish that to the committee after today's meeting. Page 103 refers to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is based in CHO 6. Phase 1 is complete while phase 2 is ongoing with discussions under way between the Department of Health and the HSE. I also note there was a 35-bed unit with possible use by acute services, which does not fall under phase 1 or 2. It is welcome nonetheless. I ask that information on that be furnished to the committee. It relates to the refurbishment of an existing vacated building. I refer finally to appendix No. 5 on page 106 of the annual report. It struck me that the attendance of members at some of the subcommittees is quite low. What will be done about that? Is Mr. Mulvany satisfied with the attendance of the members of the committees, including the audit committee and the performance and delivery committee and others? If not, what will be done to rectify that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, some of them are.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Page 106.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. Mr Mulvany can come back to me on that. It struck me that some of the meetings were under attended.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I saw that in one or two of them, but some of them were quite low. It is something to take note of. There was one where the attendance was ten. There was one with two. That was a resignation, I understand, after a short period on the board. There was another where the average was seven and the attendance was four. A number of them seem low. If there are members of the committees-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all of our witnesses. I will start with cybersecurity and the NCSC. Mr. Griffin said that the ambition was that 20 new staff would be recruited by the end of this year. Given that we are close to that point now, how successful has that been? What is the status of the recruitment programme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is good that the Department is potentially ahead of where it wanted to be. Renovations were carried out on the interim facility being used for the centre. What was the extent of those renovations, what did they cost and why were they done on an interim facility when there was a plan to move to a new facility?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That lease can be renewed again and the property used for another-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Griffin have an idea of the costs to date? How much has been spent on those interim works?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the newer building in Beggars Bush that the NCSC will move in to also owned by the OPW or is that leased?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, that is fine. If Mr. Griffin could provide a note on that, it would be much appreciated. I will now turn to the NBP, which we have discussed previously at the committee. I understand the deployment plan is 12 months behind schedule. Delving into that further, fines of €135,000 were issued in respect of build delays. I gather from what Mr. Griffin said in his opening statement, some of that is related to Covid-19 and other issues. A performance sanction of €22,500 was also issued. Performance reports for subsequent periods indicate that further sanctions may arise. Have the sanctions that were levied been paid? How many others have arisen since this report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are they not revised targets?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are we not behind on the revised targets?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Just before Mr. Mulligan comes in I would like to ask another question because my time is limited. From 1 February to August of this year, sanctions totalling €134,800 were imposed but I understand there is a refundable option if other build milestones are achieved.I ask Mr. Mulligan to touch on this in his response.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When does the refundable option kick in? How is it traded off against the milestones that are missed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Mulligan. With regard to blackspots, we focus a lot on rural Ireland but there are obviously blackspots in urban Ireland also. There are some glaring ones where there is fibre in the ground but houses cannot connect to it. I know the Department is aware of certain situations. I brought some to its attention. It is galling for people in an estate of 700 houses where it would seem financially lucrative for them to be able to connect but service providers are not willing to take up the mantle. This is a real problem for us. It goes beyond the national broadband plan because the fibre is there. How do we get around this problem?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ó hÓbáin. The Department needs a carrot and stick approach with certain operators. While they have plans, the public have been waiting years for them to be able to connect to cabinets or whatever other infrastructure is required. In urban areas there is an expectation, and rightly so. Not being able to connect when fibre is right outside the house is illogical.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, I am fine. I just want to confirm that I am here in Leinster House.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was listening to a portion of the meeting online between various other commitments this morning. I wish Mr. Hogan and his colleagues a good afternoon. It is good to have them before us again. I will start with the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statements. He said the national debt is €237 billion. That is up on the end of 2020 by €17.7 billion. He also said that it was 20% lower than that of 2020 on foot of the NTMA's ability to avail of the low interest rates over recent years. How does Mr. Hogan see the various interest rates, the challenges from inflation and everything else happening over the next number of months and potentially years - although hopefully not - impacting on our national debt going forward?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand. Mr. Hogan has a lot of notes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted that Ireland's contribution to the EU budget last year was €3.5 billion. That was 36% higher than in 2020. I know Mr. Hogan has a lot of notes, and I apologise if I am going over old ground but I heard only some, not all, of the contributions. The Department might forward a note to the committee on our contribution to the EU budget and give a year-on-year breakdown of how much we have contributed. What is the expectation for Ireland’s contribution in the coming years? Would it be to the same extent as this 36% increase? Would that be the average growth per year? How is that calculated?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did they relate to the pandemic?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Gradually-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would that demonstrate-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Dr. Whitaker and others-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the Lemass era in that regard. I mentioned the escrow account when Mr. Hogan was previously before the committee. Forgive me if he has already done so, but I ask Mr. Hogan to provide an update to the committee on its performance. I note from the information Mr. Hogan provided that there was a reduction in that. That was because of a third country. I ask Mr. Hogan to provide an update on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is an ongoing challenge to it. Do we have any time frame on that? I was under the impression that we might be nearing the end of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. Is the Department estimating that it has another year to run or could it be many years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is to be anticipated.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have one minute left and if I may-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Very good.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was going to say it did not involve six numbers, eight numbers or whatever is needed. If it was the Chair would not be sitting here at all. Does the Chair want me to take over?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the corporation tax. The witnesses may have dealt with this already when I was not here. When is that new 15% rate anticipated to take effect?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that January of 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is it. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Unfortunately, I missed the opening statements. I was at a committee meeting as well. Forgive me if I go over questions that have been asked already. I want to touch on the AHBs initially. How many AHBs are there in the State at present?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are there any outside of that framework?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What is the final figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What oversight is there of their mechanisms to draw down funding, such as CALF and CAS and all the other schemes mentioned? Is AHBRA fully responsible for the governance of the AHBs or are they individually responsible as commercial entities? How does that work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are all of the 450 registered? Is that how they are deemed to be in operation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What volume of queries about processes and complaints has the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority as regulator been dealing with?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Without going into individual detail, were those complaints made by tenants, councils or organisations? Will Ms Lyons shed some light on them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Have the three concerns from 2021 been dealt with and closed or are they ongoing cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My next question is for the Housing Agency. What funding has gone to the 450 AHBs collectively and what funding do they generate themselves?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Baneham not have a figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Ms Lyons does not mind sending that to the committee as a note after the meeting, that would be very helpful. Will the Housing Agency give an update on the development of each of the eight sites Mr. Baneham referred to that were transferred to the land aggregation scheme at the end of 2020?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. The development of eight sites was referred to.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, that is fine. Can anyone speak about those sites that were transferred to the LDA or is that outside the witnesses' remit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sixty-five sites were to be transferred out of the land aggregation scheme. Have any been transferred at this point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Baneham send a note to the committee on the remaining 60 sites? It does not have to be too detailed. If he included the size of each site and whether they are serviced, that might be helpful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. To refer back to the opening statement of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he issued a clear audit opinion for the 2021 accounts but drew attention to:... a note in the account that discloses payment of a fine to the European Commission arising from a judgement [relating to Derrybrien in Galway] of the European Court of Justice in November 2019. The case concerned Ireland’s failure to ensure that a retrospective environmental impact assessment was carried out in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway. The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that a lump sum of €5 million was paid in 2020, plus a daily fine of €15,000 and legal costs. At the outset, €15,000 per day is a phenomenal amount of money to be paying. I note the 2022 figures are not included here but I am sure the witnesses have them to hand. To date, how much has been spent on this fine? I ask the witnesses to leave out legal costs for now. We will take that as included. I suspect it is approximately €22 million, or in excess thereof. I ask the witnesses to clarify the position in that regard.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will come back to the decision and the closing off of this terrible saga and the costs incurred by the State. What is the figure for the legal costs from 2019 to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to clarify this. I quoted from his opening statement. There is a reference to legal costs. He might be able to shed------
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask that a note be sent to the committee on that matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman. In terms of the conclusion to this, is there-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It would be good to get a global figure for how much this is costing the State. That would be helpful. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a lump sum.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the conclusion to it, Mr. Doyle referred to a retrospective environmental assessment. Does the Department have a timeframe for when this might be finished, including the daily fines and all the associated costs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have just four minutes left so I ask Mr Doyle to be brief in his responses. With regard to Uisce Éireann and all the reforms that have taken place there, I am a little taken aback with regard to the separation of the entity itself. It is stated that this will take effect this year, but that is unlikely. The Committee of Public Accounts will obviously have a role in questioning Uisce Éireann on its operations, but that is not likely to happen until 2024. Why will it take so long? If the entity has been established and reformed, why is it taking so long for it to become accountable to this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We will monitor the situation. I want to turn to the local property tax. There have obviously been changes to the bands in the last year or so. In terms of the amounts collected, has the Department seen a drop-off in the payments being made by householders in local property tax globally across the country or have more people availed of the monthly payment scheme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is the Revenue Commissioners who ultimately obtain all of that information. That clarifies the position. The staffing complement of the Department was 1,207 in 2020. This increased by 159, to 1,366, in 2021. What kind of grades and areas have the new staff been deployed in? Are they at administrative officer or principal officer, PO, level or above?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	However, the 159 are brand-new staff.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department might forward a note to the committee with a breakdown of that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Since I am on the topic of staffing, there was a story in the Sunday newspapers relating to the Secretary General. There was quite extensive coverage about an issue involving him being in negotiations in respect of his salary. Is there any way he can shed light on that issue here?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is no change at present from what is listed here in this documentation in terms of salary.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses. It is good to engage with them again. I will stay with the private nursing homes. I understand the HSE is tasked with the management of the health repayments scheme. It was referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports at various times. The most recent accounts were signed off by the then CEO, as Accounting Officer, Mr. Paul Reid on 26 November 2021. I understand 35,417 applications were made to the repayments scheme and 20,302 claimants received a payment. As of 31 December 2021, €453 million had been paid to claimants and €32.5 million paid in administrative costs or a total of €486 million in overall cost to the Exchequer from 2006 to 2020 was paid. That was referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement this morning. The HSE webpage on the repayment scheme notes that a few complex cases are still being progressed. The Comptroller and Auditor General previously commented on this repayment scheme as part of the 2009 report on the accounts of public services, which came before this committee in 2011. The report examined the incidence of appeals and legal actions arising from that scheme. That report stated:Proceedings have been instituted in 306 cases, involving patients who spent time in private nursing home facilities. None of the cases have yet proceeded to hearings.That is according to the 2009 report so that may have changed. It would be helpful to the committee this morning if it had an indication of how many cases brought by residents in private nursing homes or their families were settled and how many are still active. Can Mr. Mulvany advise how many of the 306 cases that have been settled are included in the category of a few complex cases, which is stated on the website still?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department is, yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the Department able to shed any light on that? I think it is 2013 since the Department has been handling the cases.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is under note 9, as the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined in his statement. Will Mr O’Grady state from 2013 onwards how many cases have been settled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did Mr. O’Grady not think that was topical and look at it in advance of this session?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. O’Grady find it and furnish it by the end of the meeting? It is a long session, as the Chair said, and we are breaking at 11 a.m., so maybe that information could be found. I referenced €32.5 million in administrative costs for the scheme between 2006 and 2020. This figure includes almost €4 million in legal and professional fees. Will the CEO confirm if this figure includes legal fees accrued from defending the cases? Does he have a breakdown between legal and professional fees?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The €32.5 million is only for the administration of what they were entitled to as per the legislation. For anybody who took a case who was outside those parameters, there is additional cost associated with that. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Can the CFO shed any light on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Department does not have the number of cases, but does it have the figure for the cost of defence or litigation in relation to the scheme or to those who fall outside the scheme? Does it have a cost, at all, of any legal fees?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate the witnesses have some figures. However, it is a pity, given the public comment and comment within the Houses of the Oireachtas on this issue and the fact it was given in the briefing in advance of today that it would be raised that they do not have the breakdown. Mr O’Grady said 13 in 2020. Is that right?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand the Attorney General is preparing a memo for Cabinet on the legal strategy employed by the State, Department of Health and HSE to defend these claims, which is due to be published next week. It has been reported there are two substantive memos detailing legal strategy in this area, one from 2011 and another from 2017. I am conscious of the CEO's time spent in the role, but is he aware of any other substantive memos on this that the committee should be aware of?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the 2021 liability, €1.7 million was calculated for the health repayment scheme. The estimated provision for the repayment scheme was €1.7 million spent in 2021, while only €486 million of the estimated scheme cost of €1 billion has been spent to date. In December 2021, the figure was €486 million, which works out at an average of nearly €22,600 per claimant. How was the 2021 contingent liability of €1.7 million for the health scheme calculated by, I presume, the HSE?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. I return to the applications to the scheme. There were 35,417 applicants and 20,302 claimants received payment. The witnesses have alluded to people outside the parameters of the legislation etc. Were any refused for reasons other than legislative? Was there a bulk reason for refusal based on certain criteria? Are the witnesses aware of any other criteria applied for refusals of these applicants?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The CFO commented on the €1.7 million. The website states a few complex cases are still being processed. I understand those complex cases are being dealt with by the Department of Health since 2013.The HSE has no more hand, act or part in this scheme at all. It is all the Department of Health now. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does the HSE have an average payout per the scheme for claimants? Every case is obviously different as per stay etc., but is this working out as an average per claimant?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their most informative opening remarks. For me, the Irish Ombudsman Forum is an organisation with which I am newly familiar, so I read with interest the witnesses' correspondence to the committee. I have a number of questions. First and foremost, I am interested in the number of cases that the ombudsman offices are dealing with on an annual basis. Ms Justice Ring said that 2020 was busier. Perhaps she could furnish the committee with more up-to-date information after the meeting. The Office of the Ombudsman was established in 1984. Obviously, this committee is new but from 1984, what has the organisation's engagement with the Oireachtas been on annual basis, be it through annual reports or otherwise? Has engagement been very ad hoc? I note from Mr. Tyndall's remarks in September 2015 that from around 2002, engagement with the Oireachtas seemed to improve and become more formal. Today's step is most welcome, and it is great to formalise our relationship with the ombudsman offices. However, the MOU suggestion made by the witnesses is a very good one.  I am thinking about the expansion of this committee and, specifically, public petitions and those coming to us with their concerns, and, equally, others who approach the various ombudsman offices. How does that aspect fit into it? Obviously, an MOU is going to have to cover the approach to be taken if the relevant ombudsman office has dealt with a particular issue. Likewise, if the committee has dealt with an issue, the relevant office will not deal with it. I understand that. If we are going to go down that road, perhaps the name of the committee needs to be amended to ensure there is a formal recognition of our relationship with the Irish Ombudsman Forum. Maybe that is a discussion for another day. However, I certainly think an MOU is essential because I can think of several different elements to it, where the committee's work could really be blown out of proportion. How we go about that must be defined. It is a discussion that we have had as a committee. I am going to quote from the correspondence the Irish Ombudsman Forum sent to the committee which states: "The Forum has also consistently argued for a single Committee to have an oversight of Ombudsman activity". That is where we are headed today and it is to be welcomed. Given the new nature of this committee, I ask Mr. Tyndall to describe the engagement of the ombudsman offices with the Oireachtas heretofore.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. I thank Ms Justice Ring. Principle 20 states the Ombudsman shall report to Parliament on the activities of the institution at least once a year. Is that done via committees the witnesses are linked with currently? Would it assist them if such a link existed with this committee to discuss the annual report or activities for the year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms O'Reilly back and thank her for her opening remarks. Many questions on the EMA have already been asked so I will not refer to it. On Ms O'Reilly's inquiry into the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, I was taken with her reference to the gathering and assessing of data linked to the pandemic. She stated issues arose over the changing advice on face coverings. We saw this here at home when we changed tack on that front, arguably ahead of many of our European colleagues. Ms O'Reilly mentioned there was a survey of the capacity of a number of member states to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. Having regard to that and the face coverings issue, she might elaborate a little more on the inquiry. Has it concluded completely? Are there still elements being dealt with? I am not prying but just wondering whether Ms O'Reilly could elaborate a little more. I have a question that is similar to those of Deputy Buckley on Ms O'Reilly's office's engagement with us. How many complaints or inquiries does she deal with annually? How many staff are in her office? If I could ask Ms O'Reilly those questions-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will come back in on three other points. Ms O'Reilly made a recommendation, I think it was in January, to the European Commission about creating an online portal for funding. Was that recommendation taken on board and implemented? Second, there was a previous inquiry conducted by Ms O'Reilly relating to the EU Presidency and the corporate sponsoring of same. Have there been any breaches of that since? I presume not. My final question concerns the award for good administration. I want to end on a positive note. The deadline for that award was the end of January. How many organisations have been put forward, given the year it has been?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish Ms O'Reilly the best of luck with that. It is nice for all of us to have some good news once in a while.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you very much. I thank Mr. Tyndall, Mr. Garvey and Ms Joyce for their attendance today. I compliment Mr. Tyndall's on the update produced in March. It was very comprehensive and extremely informative, considering the committee's concerns. I was on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last year. Mr. Tyndall appeared before the committee and discussed many of the issues surrounding the residents in direct provision centres and their concerns in the face of the pandemic. It is evident from the Ombudsman's report today that there are ongoing complaints of different nature. What was the No. 1 complaint received by the office over the past few years, pandemic aside? Chapter 2 of the update raises issues such as driver licences, bank accounts and complaints about various Departments. Will Mr. Tyndall elaborate on the extent of those problems and why they exist? Mr. Tyndall said there were 61 complaints in 2020, down 60% from 168 in 2019. I heard what Mr. Tyndall said about being physically present. He highlighted signage and advanced notice being given in various languages, Arabic, French, Russian, etc., which is welcome. Will Mr. Tyndall give a broad outline of the number of and the biggest complaints and how they can be resolved?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Deering and Ms McGovern for their attendance today. I have a number of questions for them and, like the Chairman, I will ask a few together and then go back and forth with the witnesses. In terms of the number of complaints, whether relating to tracker mortgages, financial services, insurance or whatever else, has the ombudsman's office seen an increase or decrease within each of the categories it deals with? Mr. Deering pointed out regarding older cases that they retain the same reference number and there is sometimes a hiatus between the time of the last action on the case and the point at which a new complaint is submitted or new information comes to the fore. How many of those historical cases, as I will call them, does the ombudsman's office currently have on its books?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I must compliment the office on its website. I have heard that the website will be updated even further but in fairness, it seems quite comprehensive at first glance. In terms of the decisions of the office, how many have been appealed? I note that institutions and complainants can go to the High Court if they are not happy with a decision. Does Mr. Deering know how many of those decisions have been appealed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would make sense, given the year that we have had and the issues that the office is dealing with. I wish to turn to the decisions database of the office. I think it is most useful for people to see the office's deliberations on previous appeals and complaints. Does that deter people or does it give them confidence to make a complaint? No two cases are the same. What benefit does the office see in having the decisions database readily available for prospective complainants?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is very helpful. I have number of other questions. I will ask one more and then my colleague, Deputy Buckley, wants to contribute. In respect of the European financial ombudsman, how closely does the office work with that ombudsman? I presume that it works with the ombudsman on a regular basis. Can Mr. Deering outline to the committee how that relationship works? If a complaint is made here, there will not be collaboration unless, I presume, the complaint concerns a pan-European institution or something similar. I ask Mr. Deering to outline how that process works.  I may ask some other questions after Deputy Buckley has made his contribution.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a few other questions. I refer to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman's strategic plan from 2018 to 2021. Mr. Deering might outline some of the key achievements that his office has secured over that period. Equally, in terms of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman's outstanding goals from that plan, will they be incorporated into the new plan and is that under way? Mr. Deering might outline to the committee how that is going.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. I thank Mr. Deering for that. I congratulate the ombudsman and all the staff in the office or, as the case may be, working remotely for that. That is a phenomenal number of cases. For all to be dealt with remotely, credit where credit is due on that. I look forward to seeing the new strategic plan for Mr. Deering's role. I have a similar question to some colleagues who spoke earlier. With the pending exit of other financial institutions including Ulster Bank, KBC and, more recently, Provident, going back to my earlier question in terms of the historical cases, what would happen in the scenario where somebody has raised an issue or maybe something comes to light but the entity has in theory left this jurisdiction? If it were a British entity, that would probably complicate matters further. In terms of Brexit, since it is probably on our lips in this question, has the impact brought any new financial regulatory issues to the ombudsman's door, given that some firms may have relocated their head offices, be it here in Ireland or in other European jurisdictions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This week, I raised a question regarding the number of Irish customers seeking to have mortgages from institutions in other EU member states with the Department of Finance. I presume that would go to FIN-NET if a contract was signed with a German or Spanish bank, for example. Do the witnesses know how frequently people in Ireland draw down mortgages through other European financial institutions? Ms McGovern responded to a question asked by Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan on mortgage protection. I am the chair of the Oireachtas all-party committee on diabetes. We have evidence that some people with diabetes have been denied mortgage protection because of their condition. Has the office received many complaints in that regard or is it a relatively new phenomenon? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that the witnesses would not have it to hand but when they correspond with the committee on the question about number of different cases over the past six years, they might also include the number of cases which the office has referred to colleagues in FIN-NET, please. I thank Mr. Deering and Ms McGovern for their time today, I really appreciate it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Muldoon and Ms Ward for their presentation. This meeting has been a cursory glance over some of their reports, but I should start by complimenting them on their work, particularly how the office took the initiative as outlined in Dr. Muldoon's opening statement and investigated further when the complaint was dropped. Look at what the office has uncovered and the changes that will be brought about in the short term. Dr. Muldoon mentioned the White Paper. It is encouraging that much of it meets with his approval. I will ask a number of questions. Do the witnesses know why the 2015 McMahon report was not acted upon? Was any rationale given or was the report simply shelved after its production? Regarding Tusla's involvement in direct provision, Dr. Muldoon highlighted the need for cultural sensitivity training. Has there been any? My colleague, Deputy Buckley, mentioned something that should be commonplace, namely, that people working with children at the very least be vetted. There is a great deal of cultural diversity in the direct provision system, yet no one had the foresight to train staff to deal not only with the various complexities of individual cultural identities but with the fact of many cultures co-existing in the same facilities. I wish to ask two further questions. Three of the findings in the Safety and Welfare of Children in Direct Provision report stand out for me. I wish to ask about those. No. 3 relates to current inspections. According to it, the regime "does not take [into] account ensuring the ... supports are adequate to meet children's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development". According to No. 4 on the frequency of current inspections, "IPAS failed to meet its own benchmark of three inspections per centre per annum" and did not conduct any inspection of emergency accommodation centres where children were residing. No. 5 on an independent complaints procedure ties in with Dr. Muldoon's reference in his opening statement to the need for an independent and robust procedure that people can trust and have faith in, given that, where they are coming from, faith in authority can be questionable because of what they have experienced. Dr. Muldoon mentioned his office had written to the various agencies and that it would carry out six- and 12-month follow-ups. When was that correspondence sent and has there been any indication of a response yet?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am in the convention centre, so apologies for all the bells. At the outset, I wish to thank both Mr. Henderson and Dr. Lannon for their presentations. Apologies for not joining the meeting earlier; I was in the Chamber. I ask the witnesses to forgive me if I go over questions that have been covered. I heard some of the questions being asked, but I have a few of my own. As others have said, the Ombudsman for Children appeared before the committee previously and we had a good discussion around the White Paper. The witnesses have referenced that in many of their replies. It is important to have that tangible document to work towards it in a speedy fashion. Protection accommodation, and specifically, AHBs, were mentioned in the opening remarks. I ask the witnesses to go into more detail on their thinking on those as specific bodies for accommodation. Equally, I heard the witnesses speak of the issue of individuals sitting idly. I am very aware of that. Dr. Lannon mentioned Doras being in operation for 21 years. I recall that perhaps 18 years ago, accommodation was provided for minors who were coming into Sandycove in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. Local people set up a football club for those minors. It created a great sense of integration between local teen, early teens and many of the unaccompanied minors. When we speak about activities, entertainment and genuine integration, there is nothing like sport, music and other similar activities. That brings me onto my next question. What type of activities and entertainment are available for those who are in many of these centres? I am aware that the witnesses have said that there is a hierarchy of needs and there are needs that are greater than that.  The witnesses have mentioned mental health and suicide, which is extremely worrying. I believe I heard them say that some applicants are 15 times more likely to be diagnosed with mental health problems. That is a staggering figure. Do the witnesses have statistics on the age range of individuals that we are talking about, and equally, what services are available for them? The witnesses mentioned HIQA and the need for HIQA inspections. Obviously, if the White Paper takes off, many of these issues could fall away. However, there will need to be a system of inspections in place. I was a member of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Covid-19 Response last year. We heard about the lack of inspections in some accommodation centres. That, in itself, is worrying. We have seen other issues in relation to nursing homes. From the witnesses' perspective, what needs to change in that arena?  Senator Eugene Murphy mentioned integration and Deputy Buckley mentioned food and culture. I recall being at a school fair a few years ago. What struck me was that the food and elements of the culture of all nationalities represented in the school were on display. Again, that sent a signal of true integration. These children were celebrating their cultures and being proud of where they are from, yet they were loving living in Ireland. That is what we need to embrace. In referencing my own constituency, we used to have a festival of world cultures, which was extremely well publicised and known right across the world. Unfortunately, it grew too big for one local authority area to take on. It pointed to the need to celebrate culture, diversity and integration. My final question concerns education. The issue is one that comes up now and again and I am sure both organisations are well aware of it. It concerns individuals who are in education and are told one day that they are being relocated to perhaps another part of the country. That obviously has a huge and devastating impact on those individuals. We spoke of mental health problems earlier on. I can only assume that such instances of relocation would compound such problems. The Department has acted compassionately in some cases, but I am sure the witnesses are aware of others where that did not happen. Perhaps they might touch on that in their responses. I thank them both for their presentations; they were most interesting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the same issue as Senator Murphy, as you are Chair of this committee and since we serve on the same committee, I did not hear the radio interview but I read about it in a newspaper recently. I have to say I was shocked by your alleged remarks. As I said, I did not hear them. I would like you to clarify them, be that here today if we have time or, certainly, in a public forum. The article I read is unsettling and the matter needs to be addressed, obviously, by yourself, because the article related to you. I am sure you know the one I am talking about. Other members have spoken on it as well. I await to hear from you on that, Chair. Thank you.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I second the nomination.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is a pleasure to have Mr. Tyndall back before the committee. I say that as a new Deputy, which I am until the next election. Mr. Tyndall's engagement, insight and assistance to this committee have been valuable and worthwhile. We are a relatively newly reformed committee, as he knows having assisted us with that process. I want to put on record my appreciation and that of the committee to him and his staff. He rightly highlighted the superb support that his staff have given to him, as well as highlighting their flexibility at the outset of the pandemic. I share his pain in having moved office before the pandemic hit. Many new Deputies had that same experience. As the Acting Chairman read out Mr. Tyndall's list of achievements and detailed his experience, it was beginning to sound like an episode of "This is Your Life". His achievements are remarkable and he can be rightly proud of them. The Magdalen laundries were mentioned and I refer to the impact Mr. Tyndall had on those survivor's lives. The end-of-life care in hospitals is so important to many families who go through that process. Direct provision was another matter that Mr. Tyndall dealt with and that is to name just a few of his achievements. It is a remarkable career and I am delighted to hear that it has been extended to Christmas at least. Hopefully, he will be back before us again. I refer to the 2020 annual report and I want to delve into a number of issues. When we last met we had a full discussion on direct provision. Mr Tyndall said that 168 complaints were received in 2019 compared with 61 in 2021. I would have thought the reverse would be the case. He might come back to me on that. Mr. Tyndall also mentioned the Wasted Lives report on those under 65. Unfortunately I had dealings with a constituent the other day and it just so happened that the only care that individual could receive was in a nursing home. It is not appropriate and I note Mr. Tyndall referred to that in his opening remarks. We need to examine and get away from such inappropriate placements for people. He said he was able to visit 28 people under 65 at the time who were living in nursing homes, yet some €3 million was ultimately allocated by the HSE. How is that progressing? If Mr. Tyndall answers those two questions I might come back in.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It concerned the Wasted Lives report involving the under 65s and the €3 million invested in 2021. Does Mr. Tyndall have any insight into the progress on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we might work on for our work programme. Mr. Tyndall mentioned prison complaints, which have been brought under his jurisdiction, but it has been painfully slow. Can he elaborate on that? Is it on the departmental side? Is it the Prison Service or is it a combination? What is the problem there? Mr. Tyndall mentioned the Venice principles and that he hoped this committee would continue that work and possibly co-sponsor or take up the sponsorship of that. Between that and the under 65s in nursing homes, I hear his call on that. As a committee member, I will work to put that on our work programme and continue the good work begun by the Office of the Ombudsman.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How long has this process been ongoing? Is it two or three years?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Say no more.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the Venice principles, this is possibly something this committee can look at for our work programme. I thank Mr. Tyndall and wish him all the best.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to return to the issue of access to transport for people living with disabilities. Mr. Tyndall highlighted in his opening remarks that, in 2012, his predecessor, Ms Emily O'Reilly, issued a special report regarding issues relating to mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant. He noted that, nine years later, that has still not been implemented. However, he went on to state that it is his understanding that the Department of Finance is to develop a new and more equitable scheme and that he hopes it will be included in the finance Bill this year. Is that a belief based on engagement or is it the hunch of a gentleman who is due to retire in a couple of weeks? Is he certain that it will be included in the Bill? He referred to the issue of faulty equipment or that of a person living in a rural area whose bus does not arrive. I have personal experience of an issue in urban areas relating to lifts at DART stations or whatever not working. That causes significant inconvenience and distress for the individuals concerned. Does Mr. Tyndall expect progress to be made on that specific element?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It may be something we can put on our work programme to revisit. The next time the witnesses are at the committee, we might probe that again. It is an important issue and one all Members of the Upper and Lower Houses are frequently made aware of.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That would be great. I support Senator Buttimer's call for having either or both of Iarnród Éireann and CIÉ in before the committee. Maybe that would be in the new year, after Mr. Tyndall's report.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could I suggest that we might hold off on the remaining petitions until the next meeting given the attendance for the remainder of this meeting?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No. I thank the Chairman.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with the last point the Chairman made. We should follow up with Irish Water, first and foremost, and see what response comes from that. Perhaps we could then go to the council and take it from there. Unless the secretariat has something to offer contrary to that, I think that is the best way to approach the matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We have redone the website and promoted the facility of this committee to the public. What level of uptake have we had? For the next meeting, is it possible to compare the level of engagement? Could we also consider other ways of promoting the committee through our engagement with various ombudsmen and, more importantly, the public directly?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Perhaps we could have a discussion at our next virtual meeting of ways in which to do that. It would be important to examine how many petitions we have taken compared with previously. This year has been a difficult one to use in a comparison, but speaking as a newer member of the committee, it would be interesting to see what level of engagement we have had over the years month on month or whatever the case may be. Perhaps we could put that on the agenda for our next meeting or the meeting after that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Go raibh maith agat.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is its a two-hour session or a three-hour one?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No pressure but we want the number of petitions to skyrocket after that video.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	A cross-party TikTok. I have never heard of it. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their time and the statement. I have a few questions, and I might leave some of them to the second round depending on my own availability. When we last spoke with the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, about this, his office had dealt with a number of complaints and a number of issues had arisen particularly in light of the pandemic. I recognise the work done on the White Paper but I also acknowledge the challenges that Covid-19 presented not only for the Department but for the service users and providers. In that vein, I welcome the reforms around the complaint procedures the Secretary General, Dr. Lynch, outlined. It is very welcome and it is timely. Some might argue it is overdue but it is there now and that is important. On Dr. Lynch's last comment on the 55 inspections, were they unannounced inspections or pre-arranged? What is the breakdown? If you want to have three inspections per year, is there a breakdown between notified and unannounced inspections? Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the White Paper and phase one. I am wondering about those reception and integration centres. Is there a likelihood that the existing ones will be redeveloped or are there going to be new ones because some of them are not fit for purpose? Dr. Lynch might elaborate on that. My second question for now, although I will come back in with others, is in regard to what Dr. Lynch said applicants receiving income support but only when they move into phase two. For those in phase one, what are the income supports? A number of years ago we had a reception centre in Dun Laoghaire for unaccompanied minors. Obviously there was a big challenge in terms of their well-being and safety but equally there were constant challenges for them from a financial perspective. What happens to families and individuals who are received under phase one of the proposed new reforms? I thank the Chair and I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I missed that point. The sound broke up.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The sound is breaking up a little.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Secretary General.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the implementation of the White Paper and the new system, the Secretary General said it will be supported by a programme board. I understand it will be phased in between now and 2024. The Secretary General said it would include representatives of Departments, agencies, NGOs, a person who has transitioned through the direct provision system, which is very welcomed, and relevant experts. There is also a programme board which is chaired by the Secretary General and there is a separate external advisory group. Will the Secretary General go through that again? I am looking at the structures and I made notes as the Secretary General spoke. We have two programme boards, one from the Secretary General's Department and one from the Department of Justice. We have a co-ordination committee, we have an International Protection Support Services, IPSS, transition team, we have an external advisory group, we have the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality and we have a risk committee. I understand that it is complex but I hope we have tried to simplify it. If that is the aim, it scares me that there are so many different oversight committees. I hope for the Secretary General's sake that he is not sitting on each one of those. For myself and other committee members, would the Secretary General run through that again so we can see how they all fit in with each other? As we know, stakeholders can be very broad. Who are we hoping will fill the roles on these very important committees and oversight groups? Speaking of people who have already transitioned though the system, as it were, I would like to hear the voices of current service users, be they adults or minors. The only way we can really and truly learn is from those who are experiencing it. That is not to detract from those who have gone through it, but by the time this is implemented, the system will have hopefully radically changed. On the programme boards, what integration and co-operation will there be between the two Departments? It scares me to have two programme boards in two different Departments. I am worried about duplication or things falling through the gaps. To go back to the Ombudsman, Mr. Tyndall's appearance at this committee, one of the big concerns highlighted was in respect of individuals who currently look to stay where they are being told they have to move, move school, move the whole family to another part of the country and without any regard for their feeling about it. How is that going to change with the full implementation of the White Paper? What can we expect from the perspective of those who want to relocate? I refer to respecting people's cultural and religious ethos. The Secretary General mentioned a new customer service phone line, which is wonderful. I am wondering about the languages skills of those agents. The Secretary General mentioned literature being distributed. How broad is that? The issue of unaccompanied minors is sadly a huge one, which could potentially get worse over the next few years. What specifically are we going to do to improve the reception and the greeting those individuals get, given the fear they faced getting here in the first place?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Secretary General. I must head off to the Chamber.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and I thank them for the opening statement. I, too, join colleagues in paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in the tragedy in the English Channel. If ever we needed a reminder of the need for a robust and efficient asylum system that is it. We know of other European countries that have been dealing with this on a daily basis, unfortunately, and of the loss of life at sea of those who are trying to cross waters. I join with the comments of the Chairman and others in that regard. I thank Ms Buckley for her opening remarks in respect of which I have a number of questions. There has been a significant improvement in the engagement of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, with Members of the Oireachtas from the appointments system to updates on queries. I have experienced this myself. It is important to put that on the record. Like me, new Members of the House since 2020 have been grappling with the pandemic since then. The engagement from the INIS has, as I said, improved over the past number of months.  Ms Buckley mentioned that the new system should be operational by 2024. Given everything that we have experienced, that people are remote working and that the INIS system is in the main paper based, is that still on track? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Buckley specifically referred to the staff and thanked them for their work and the way they did it during the pandemic. My experience showed they were very much engaged and were able to correspond with us and our queries. That was also true for members of the public who engaged with them. I know that there were pressures there. Given what Ms Buckley has said about the volume of paper they deal with ordinarily, it is only right that we acknowledge the way in which they worked. I want to put that on the record today. ICT was one of the main recommendations in the review. Ms Buckley mentioned cases that were backlogged or had been hanging around for some time. Were any cases lost due to paper-based files? Is there an idea of the cost of the introduction of an ICT system? From what Ms Buckley said about the existing capabilities or lack thereof, it will have to be built from scratch.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No doubt we will discuss that in time. How am I for time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The end-to-end review process of the IPO and IPAT was mentioned. Apart from the finding on ICT, how many findings were there? How will they be introduced or is this already happening?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It does give us a clearer picture.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will start with the prioritisation of cases that are agreed with the UNHCR. The witnesses said this was updated last June. How does that process work and how often does that co-ordination happen?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the website. The new immigration website is online and it looks wonderful but there is still the question of the old website.My suggestion is that we would be greeted by a portal combining the old information and a current application, because while the banner runs along all the pages saying that there is a new website, as of July of this year, I suggest that just in case that was missed, perhaps the Department would look at a front portal that would give the old and new websites, or some way of doing that. However, that is neither here nor there. In terms of the new application and the chatbots to which Senator Murphy referred, how many languages are available on the new website for people to engage with?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I could not see any when I went onto the site. That is a barrier in itself that we want to try to eradicate. A couple of weeks or a couple of months is a big timeline. Does Mr. Delaney have an estimated time of when the site will go live?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Delaney. He might correspond with the committee when that is done as it is a matter of interest to us. We have raised it before in one of our engagements with the Ombudsman. I thank Ms Buckley for raising the programme boards. She was obviously aware that we were asking questions about it. I had a few questions to raise about the two programme boards. I was worried about duplication, but Ms Buckley has clarified that in her opening statement. In her opening statement, she also referred to the ministerial decisions unit and that negative decisions were suspended for a period. I presume the unit is up and running again. How many cases were impacted during the suspension?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is what Ms Buckley is telling is us that, in theory, there is a tsunami of negative decisions due to be released?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are some hundreds.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	When did the decision take place to suspend the issuance of negative decisions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am just thinking about the recipients. If I were an applicant who was being refused, no news normally means good news. Ms Buckley can see where I am going with this. She also mentioned timing in respect of schooling. We sometimes get cases where a student is in a local school and people want the individual to remain in the State. If all of these letters are to go out, presumably at once-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know. I appreciate that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I saw that facility on the website. I will ask one more question and make a comment. Ms Buckley mentioned the undocumented. My understanding is that a process was due to begin in mid to late December but she referred to 2022. Which is it? Is it starting at the end of this year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. I thank Ms Buckley for that. In her opening remarks, she mentioned the outcome of the review.There will be another review of all the changes that have been made and a decision will be made around the end of 2022 on that, on whether additional resources and measures are needed, and on any significant issues around legacy cases. I hope we will engage before then, but if not, I suggest that, once the review has concluded and there is a report, we have an engagement on the review process. I am interested in the iteration of the website, the improvement and the functionality of it and the internal information and communications technology, ICT, processes the witnesses spoke about, as well as other improvements and measures taken in the witnesses' office, which I commend. It would be good for the committee to keep on this issue and engage with the witnesses on it in late 2022 or just after that. I thank the witnesses for their attendance.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank our witnesses for their opening remarks at their responses. I apologise for my delay because I am attending another committee at the same time. I thank Mr. Justice Mahon for the presentation and for the answers he has given. I want to touch on a few items if I may. Perhaps these questions have been answered already but I would appreciate responses to them. I was looking at the number of complaints in the various annual reports from 2017 right through to 2020. To take one figure in isolation, which stood out to me, is the Air Corps. The figures are broken down, and maladministration is a category in the 2017 to 2018 report. There are 18 cases. I am unsure as to whether they are initial complaints or if they are complaints that went through an initial process and then went on to be investigated. In 2019, again for the Air Corps, the category of maladministration cases dropped to eight and in 2020 to two cases. Without drilling into every category in every single aspect of the Defence Forces, will Mr Justice Mahon elaborate please on why there was such a high figure? Was that report amalgamated between 2017 and 2018? Even if so, it is still higher than the previous years. I will lead with this question first please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am going to discuss some of the statistics from the annual report in a few moments. Will Mr. Justice Mahon give the committee an overall breakdown of the complaints from a gender perspective? Have there been more complaints over the years from females than there have been from males? What about over the past 12 months? Does Mr. Justice Mahon have that figure? Does he have a breakdown of the numbers of complaints received from serving members and retired members?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will Mr. Justice Mahon give a note to the committee containing a breakdown of those complaints by gender and the numbers of complainants who are retired and the numbers who are still serving? I heard what he said about the lacuna between the time a member is serving and when they transition into retirement. However, it might be of interest to the committee, particularly in the context of our report, if there were such a breakdown.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Justice Mahon answered a question from one of my colleagues a little while ago relating to the "Women of Honour" programme, which brought to light a worrying trend or culture that may have existed within the Defence Forces. I heard what Mr. Justice Mahon said about the 2004 Act, which gives him the powers to carry out his role. The customer charter quotes section 4(2)(b)(vi) of the Act, referring to an occasion where the subject of a complaint was an action that was "unreasonable, notwithstanding consideration of the context of the military environment". Section 4(2)(c) refers to an action that "was not an order issued in the course of a military operation". Section 6(3) of the Act states, "A complainant shall make a complaint referred to in subsections (1) and (2) not later than 12 months". I heard Mr. Justice Mahon say the content of "Women of Honour" fell outside of his jurisdiction unless there was legislative change. Is there a willingness or a desire on the part of serving members, in particular, to come forward or is there a reluctance to come forward to the ombudsman with complaints?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a fear factor? I am wondering if we are seeing the true volume.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It does, and Mr. Justice Mahon is right about the internal process. If people have already taken that step, it would be no harm for them to go on to the ombudsman if they are not satisfied with the internal resolution of the case. That is fine. Does Mr. Justice Mahon also look at complaints from those in the Reserve Defence Force?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If Mr. Justice Mahon is going to send a note containing figures to the committee after the meeting, I would ask him to include the figures for the Reserve Defence Force. That would be of interest to me. It is an important figure.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would a rough estimate, to which I will not hold Mr. Justice Mahon, be that 80% of the complaints come from serving members, 10% from the Reserve Defence Force and 10% from retired members? Would retired members comprise even 10% of complaints?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is all right. We are not going to hold Mr. Justice Mahon to his figures.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Justice Mahon spoke of his recommendations a short while ago, and that the Defence Forces have taken those on board, which is good news. Is there a follow-up on the recommendations Mr. Justice Mahon makes? Are there checks and balances from his own office? Does he have the resources to do that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course it can, yes. In his opening statement, Mr. Justice Mahon mentioned the fact that in excess of 95% of new referrals are fully investigated and reported on within four weeks. When he said "reported on", did that mean those cases are investigated and a response has issued to the complainant or did it mean an internal report has been compiled?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I think it is a remarkable timeframe. For 95% of the cases to be dealt with in that timeframe is very impressive, I must say. It is probably appreciated by those who are making the complaints, because they know where they stand after that investigation. Finally, I wish to turn to the issue of Women of Honour. In Mr. Justice Mahon's opening statement, he mentioned other jurisdictions, such as Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway and South Africa. Perhaps the ombudsmen in those jurisdictions come across similar issues of serving female members of their defence forces or armies. Changes could be made to the 2004 Act to give the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces more powers to investigate those complaints or at least have another avenue for individuals to come to the office with allegations of sexual complaints, intimidation or anything else. Is that something that other jurisdictions have, or other ombudsmen have in those jurisdictions? How does the ombudsman see the best avenue for those individuals to make a complaint? Is it through an ombudsman-style office, or a different course of action that is taken in other jurisdictions?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is something we might consider in terms of our own recommendations as a committee, subsequently. I thank Mr. Justice Mahon and Mr. O'Neill for their attendance and for their answers to the questions of the committee members.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The ombudsman referenced the special reports that may be done by his office and they perhaps come from the route from the Minister's office. How many special reports has the ombudsman's office completed since its foundation in 2005? Does Mr. Justice Mahon know how many special reports have been completed or have there been any?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Justice Mahon might send a note on that, please, if he would not mind. Sticking with the December 2005 date from when cases could be taken, were there any cases that pre-dated 2005? I accept this pre-dates Mr. Justice Mahon's time. If there were such cases and assuming they would have fallen into the scope of the work of the ombudsman had they been post December 2005, what happened to those individuals, have they been left in limbo, and have there been many of them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If the office has any information on that, it would of interest to me. I say that because if we are looking at legislation and the power that gives the office that right, we need to be sure about this issue. I would not like to think there are cases from before 2005 that have been declined on the basis of the date of the complaint. I note the ombudsman said he is excluded from investigating certain matters such as structures, the deployment of Defence Forces, and terms and conditions of employment. Why is the conciliation and arbitration scheme specifically excluded or is that just something Mr. Justice Mahon highlighted in his presentation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I thank Mr. Justice Mahon and look forward to his note.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Agreed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am very familiar, as is the clerk and the other members of the Oireachtas staff, with Standing Order 218 and the implications that an Oireachtas committee, albeit a different one from this one, had for the nature and course of engagement of Oireachtas committees with witnesses. I am struck by two other aspects. One is the correspondence that we have received, which we went through in private session. It has a lot of content and background information which I was certainly not au fait with or aware of at our December meeting. A lot more information has also come to light. The opening statement of Westmeath County Council states that "an Oireachtas committee is not an appropriate forum to ventilate legal arguments". I accept what the Chairman has said and obviously we may want to discuss the history of this issue. However, if we are not sure that there is, potentially, a challenge to any previous legal case or if a new legal case could emerge, this could have an unintended consequence and implications for either of the State organisations represented, be it the county council or Waterways Ireland, the Oireachtas and, potentially, us. I confirm that I am on campus but the fact we are even having this conversation shows that members are uncertain and unsure. I ask the Chairman to deliberate on whether we should proceed and indicate whether he feels comfortable that we proceed. I would also like to hear from the clerk because Standing Order 218 has changed all engagement with the Committee of Public Accounts, for obvious reasons. We have given notice to the witnesses and I appreciate that they have come in and given their time. From the correspondence that we went through yesterday in private session and from what I have heard today in the opening remarks made by both organisations, there seems to be a very grey area and a narrow point in which we can continue a discussion. I ask the Chair to rule on whether we should proceed and indicate whether he is comfortable that we proceed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On a point of information, based on our discussion before Deputy Buckley came in with a more general question, the agenda for today is quite specific and relates to a particular site. We are all aware of which one it is. Plenty of county councils border the River Shannon and, presumably, have unauthorised development along it, but this is very specific. Before we proceed, I, along with colleagues who have spoken about this, would like to hear whether this meeting should proceed, in the Chairman's view, and I would like to hear also from the clerk to the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am not familiar with the Owenacurra Centre or St. Brigid's hospital. Given they are health services, is there a reason the petitions are not matters for the health committee? Even if we bring in the groups, followed by the HSE, I cannot see any resolution. The HSE is probably the best option if we are to proceed, but I believe the best route for a petition of this nature is the health committee, not this committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that, if we are doing a joint meeting, I suggest that we have it with the HSE. Having had a quick look at a few items with regard to St. Brigid’s, I think the group is quite political. If we have questions about the centres, we should ask the HSE ultimately. We thank the petitioners for their petition and for raising the issues and bringing it to the attention of the committee, but we should bring in the HSE and discuss it with it directly. That would be my proposal.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. I would argue both, but St. Brigid's certainly is.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am not doubting there is no interest in this and, absolutely, there is interest in it. As I said, if we want to resolve the issue, we should bring in the HSE. That is my proposal. If it is a joint sitting of this committee and the Committee on Health, that is fine. I think that would be the best proposal.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Member from the Upper House. Does the Chairman know whether St. Brigid's and Owenacurra have written to the health committee? Deputy Higgins has made a good point there. As I said, I believe the health committee should be the first one to examine this and then, as Deputy Buckley said, if it is not examined, it can come to us. I still stand by what I said earlier, that if the HSE were to come in we have already received a petition to put before it. Obviously Deputy Buckley is familiar with his local area and the local issues there and I accept what he is saying. It is not a political issue. Other members are more aware of the issues with St. Brigid's. If the HSE were to come in, we could put the questions from the petitioners to it, short-circuit the whole thing and hopefully get a resolution. That would be a good day's work. Does the Chairman or the clerk to the committee know if the petitioners have written to the Joint Committee on Health? As I understand it, Deputy Buckley is a member of that committee or a substitute member. If the petitioners have done so, we should see what that committee does first and then offer to look at it jointly or come back to the issue at our next meeting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Deputy Higgins had made a sensible suggestion. I know we have had a long discussion on this and I am conscious that there is a third petition to examine. We should defer the matter until we know what the Joint Committee on Health is doing. Let us come back to it at our next meeting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Let it not be said that I never agree with Senator Craughwell because I totally agree with his suggestion. In fairness to Senator Murphy, this committee certainly wants to hear about the concerns of constituents and their local centres. There is no question about that. To the point that Deputy Higgins made earlier, we also must be cognisant of our work and duplication with other committees. The Chairman suggested that the clerk would seek information from other committees and I would not limit that to the health committee. From listening to colleagues, nobody seems to be certain which committee is involved. This group is obviously very active and I commend its members on their work to date. If they have corresponded with other committees and subcommittees of the Oireachtas, we need to find out. Perhaps they have been in touch with the Sub-Committee on Mental Health or another Oireachtas committee. We need to be sure whether a site visit is happening. Deputy Buckley says the visit relates to the physical building, and that is fair enough. It might not be about the services. I cannot imagine an Oireachtas committee attending a site and not discussing the services in tandem with discussions of a building. Why would a building be repaired if there are not to be services? They will have a discussion around everything. We need to have that report, as Deputy Higgins rightly said. I would also like for this committee to inquire of all other Oireachtas committees to see is this on the agenda for any other committee. When we establish that, Senator Murphy's point about the regional health forum is a very good suggestion. It is more targeted. The regional health manager would be at those meetings, along with the other professionals within the HSE. We might not actually get that audience at a meeting of ours but that is not to say we should not try. We must ensure there is no duplication happening in the Oireachtas. We have learned today that a site visit is happening, which I welcome. Following on from that, we can discuss it at the next meeting. That is why I agree with Senator Craughwell's suggestion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank my proposer and seconder. I also thank the committee for its support. In his absence, I commiserate with Senator Craughwell because it has probably been the longest running election in the history of the House but it has been fought in a good spirit. I thank Senator Craughwell for his time and contribution to date.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. Go raibh maith agat.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Go ahead, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Feeney is very welcome. I thank him for his attendance. I felt for him a moment ago as he was entering into the snake pit of talking about Independents. You could insult one Independent and have a complaint made against you, perhaps to the Press Ombudsman himself. In all seriousness, I thank Mr. Feeney for his attendance and for the opportunity for the committee to examine the annual reports from 2018 through to 2020. My colleague, Deputy Higgins, referred to the coverage over the course of the pandemic, the resilience of the press and the reliance of the public on the press for information. The press has been invaluable, and there are many trusted sources. Mr. Feeney mentioned the difference between online and print. There is definitely a difference between material produced by reputable, trained and trusted journalists and some of the online content created by individuals. Of course, there is no fact-checking of the latter, and that places a significant onus on the press and, indeed, Mr. Feeney and the Press Council. I note from Mr. Feeney's opening remarks his welcome for the online safety commissioner and the media authority. It is important to have the embrace of Mr. Feeney's office and that of the Press Council in time. It is important that it is first of all recognised that there is an issue and that it is not just a monetary issue facing media organisations. There are also issues of trust and bias involved, and public confidence needs to be restored. I note what Mr. Feeney said about the Future of Media Commission and its awaited report. I will say no more about those aspects but I acknowledge and welcome what Mr. Feeney has said. Turning to Mr. Feeney's opening statement, I note that his office was established in 2008. As a new Member of the House, certainly a new member of this committee, I welcome the fact that he is before us today. How many complaints, on average, has his office dealt with year on year? I know he will not go into any specifics, but what is the general figure?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Feeney for that comprehensive response. I know the Chair will tell me when I am out of time. I will come back in latter with further questions. Delving into the average of 400 complaints the Press Council receives per year, some of which, as Mr. Feeney says, are misdirected, does he have a percentage for the number of people who think they are contacting his office correctly but whom he has to redirect? I note he has only two and a half whole-time staff working in his office, which is quite a load for those staff. Can he give us a sense of how many complaints are misdirected?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is interesting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Feeney referred in his opening statement that the Press Ombudsman unlike the other ombudsman offices is not statute based. Why is this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Feeney mentioned the Southern Star and regional and local newspapers. All of us on the committee are aware of the lack of local newspapers, particularly from my perspective as a Dubliner. Only two remain in the city. I often think of the advertising revenue. Mr. Feeney said 85% of advertising revenue now goes to online platforms. Of course this presents challenges for local newspapers. I am not sure how we can get around this. As people have said, it is about targeting the message to individuals. Campaigns have moved very much online. I was struck by a comment Mr. Feeney made at the end of his opening statement about the complaints he received. Complaints were about articles and not general claims about the press. The time limit of three months is quite short. Does this include appealing it to the Press Council? Does the three months cover the whole time period?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I was going to ask a question about the right to be forgotten legislation. Much has been said about it. Certain individuals and certain organisations want articles and pieces about them to be forgotten. It surprises me Mr. Feeney is giving out the information if the complaint is about something that was written more than three months previously. Does Mr. Feeney think the right to be forgotten legislation needs to be tailored to certain types of articles rather than the way it appears to cover everything?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with Mr. Feeney, and I hope we can have another discussion in the short term on this, that there is a balance to be struck. Unfortunately there are individuals who are availing of it whom we should not be forgetting about at all. Just because they do not have a conviction it does not mean they should be forgotten. I thank Mr. Feeney for his time today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Dr. Muldoon and his team and it is good to engage with them again. I am sure the Chairman will tell me I do not have as long as I want but I have quite a bit to ask about. In fairness to Dr. Muldoon, his opening statement was very thorough. It gave us many interesting points to ponder and on which to engage with him and his office. In his opening statement Dr. Muldoon mentioned the 2019 Progress for Children report. From what he said about that, it is so broad and there is so much in it that I suggest we invite Dr. Muldoon and his staff back again to talk about that specifically because I do not think we will do it justice in the few minutes each of us have. That would be my first suggestion. On the very timely publication of Jack's Case: One Year On, which Dr. Muldoon said was published just yesterday, having read it, and it too is exceptionally thorough, I want to ask a few things about it. Dr. Muldoon might speak to it because he will be able to give more background. I am conscious of people who are viewing the committee and might not be aware of the full facts. The report states Jack is now nine, having first come to the attention of the HSE disability services when he was four. What struck me most is that, when Dr. Muldoon investigated Jack's case, he found the administrative actions of both the HSE and Tusla had a negative impact on his life. That line in the report stood out for me. I was just at the Committee of Public Accounts and the HSE was before us discussing CAMHS. Dr. Muldoon a moment ago mentioned the issue in Kerry. We are very aware of the failings of that particular service, but here we are and Jack is only one individual on whom the ombudsman has completed a report. I am sure there have been others. For us, as public representatives, it is quite scary to read that line. On top of that, the report also said Jack was deemed medically ready for discharge from hospital in August 2017, which begs the question, if the Office for Ombudsman for Children was only alerted in January 2018, and he was discharged eventually the previous August, how long was he actually in the care? The positive news is that Jack was thriving when Dr. Muldoon last met him. That is fantastic and I commend Dr. Muldoon and the team on the work they have done. It must be exceptionally satisfying, having come across such a failing of the system, of all different parts of the system, which is quite unnerving, to see he is now doing so well. I will let Dr. Muldoon speak to the recommendations and the various conclusions. There is a positive side to Jack's case but I raise it, and I ask Dr. Muldoon to speak to it, because I am sure there are other cases similar to Jack's of which we are not aware. I will hand over to Dr. Muldoon. I have other questions as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Leonard. Dr. Muldoon mentioned the case of Molly. Through the Chair, I request that when the ombudsman produces this type of report, he consider sending copies to the committee for our consideration and engagement with him and his colleagues if time permits and it is suitable. When did the case of Molly take place? I am not familiar with that report. What year was it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was in 2018 or 2019.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Tusla is not an old organisation. In large part, it came from the HSE. Mr. Leonard used the word "siloing". Unfortunately, I have come across examples of it myself. Things can fall between two stools and nobody takes responsibility. That was not the aim of the Child and Family Agency. As Dr. Muldoon is well aware, we had a referendum on children that was meant to try to put their needs and priorities first. If I heard it correctly, it was stated that there are 400 children in a situation similar to that in Molly's case which, in itself, is frightening. I hear what Mr. Leonard is saying. There are ten recommendations that are quite interesting in themselves. I note that Jack made his first Holy Communion recently, which is positive news. He does seem to be thriving, which is excellent. I may come back in as I have other questions. I will let Deputy Higgins come in first. To conclude on this issue, it is stated on page 12 of the report: The HSE told us that, informed by the learning of the needs of children with complex disability who were, and currently are, in acute hospitals beyond medical need, a HSE/Tusla ‘Jack Report Working Group’ are working on a national review of the current need for alternative care for this cohort of children.Are those the 400 children to whom reference was made or is it a separate cohort? Obviously, Molly's case is different. It relates more to foster families.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It reminds me of the situation for adults who have complex needs as a result of a change-of-life experience and are effectively hostages in a hospital because there is no alternative placement for them. The difference for them is they may have siblings or next of kin who can speak on their behalf, whereas in the case instanced, we are talking about a vulnerable child effectively left to his or her own devices in a hospital without anyone looking at his or her needs. I will follow up on the working group. When was it established?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Are our guests going to tell me it was yesterday, like the report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I appreciate that. I will come back in as I have other questions. I thank our guests.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In his opening remarks Dr. Muldoon mentioned, and Deputy Higgins just touched on, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. I noticed Dr. Muldoon also stated later on that there was an increase in referrals to his office directly from children themselves. Has he had any kind of dealings with the Department of Education? I believe it is section 28 where if a child is refused entry an appeal then has to be made directly to the Department. Perhaps it is section 38 or something like that. Has Dr. Muldoon had any dealings with the Department directly on those kind of cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Dr. Muldoon would be aware that, obviously, every action has a consequence, because by that being removed, depending on how established an area is, that has an knock-on effect for people who may have thought that their children were going to go to X school and now realising that, depending on population growth or whatever in that area, that has a knock-on effect. I understand the rationale behind it absolutely. I would like to comment on Dr. Muldoon’s report on direct provision and his latest report, Childhood Paused. I believe his report on direct provision was titled Direct Division. I compliment him on the titling of his reports because it is important to speak to the content and tone of the report. We have spoken before about direct provision. I am also delighted he has increased his staff because if I recall correctly, that was one of the issues and challenges he was facing at the time, although it has not increased that much since we last spoke.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is very positive news. When Dr. Muldoon said in 2020 he saw a small increase in numbers of direct referrals, he touched on schooling, concern about calculated grades and all that, but also the mental health impact and the restrictions. I think I speak for all of my colleagues here when I say that we have all seen it in our respective constituency offices. Unfortunately, that will be seen for quite some time yet. What kind of issues were presenting? When Dr. Muldoon said he was concerned about mental health and the impact the restrictions were having, what kind of issues can he outline?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The children themselves were very involved and engaged with us as public representatives on that, which was good to see. It allowed them to vent a little too and articulate their concerns about what was facing them. It was not an easy time at all, but it is nice to see normality returning. Speaking of school, Dr. Muldoon mentioned the impact of school closures. He specifically referenced children with disabilities, which is correct because online learning was not something some of them could engage with for long periods, if at all, as well as children who are homeless, children with mental health issues, children living in direct provision and Traveller and Roma children. I argue there is a cohort who may not have fitted into any of those categories, namely, children from low-income families who did not have the ability to engage properly with technology. They may have had an iPhone. I had experience of this, where there was an iPhone in the house but that is not sufficient for looking at documents and so forth on screens, as we know. There is a gap in that regard. I will not touch on assessments of need because that was addressed by Deputy Buckley. Deputy Higgins referred to the online safety commissioner in the context of her experience with the other committee of which she is a member. I was taken with what Dr. Muldoon said about the online safety commissioner being of concern to him. Will he elaborate a little further on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is it fair to say that more work needs to be done in order to satisfy the concerns of the ombudsman?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank all the representatives for those very comprehensive answers. This is ever so slightly outside the remit of today's discussion because the reports are from 2018 to 2020, although the 2018 report would be sufficient to cover my question. I notice that for some reason there is a spike in the number of complaints listed on the ombudsman's website for May 2017. They are head and shoulders above everything else and there was no pandemic at that time. Does anybody have any reason for such an increase?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. I very much thank everybody for their engagement. Unfortunately, I will have to switch off my camera. I look forward to further engaging with the representatives in detail on that report and to talking with them again.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Mr. Walsh. I thank him for his attendance, his contribution and his original petition. He has highlighted various elements. He has a great knowledge of and interest in this. As Deputy Buckley said, the legislation is already here. It needs to be implemented and enforced where necessary. I was particularly pleased to hear Mr. Walsh mention my county council, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which took this step a number of years ago. There was hesitation about it. Mr. Walsh mentioned the weeds and so on that he saw on his route through Dublin to Leinster House. There is a knock-on effect. Some pesticides and herbicides do what they say on the tin, but there are unseen impacts on the environment. That is why Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown took what was, to my knowledge, a unanimous decision, and other local authorities acted too. Mr. Walsh mentioned his own county. I was reading the guidelines and one matter stuck out. The officers of the pesticide control division in the Department will inspect local authorities for compliance with the sustainable usage of pesticides directive, SUD. Does Mr. Walsh have much information from the Department about how many inspections of local authorities have been conducted? Colleagues have mentioned restrictions in sensitive areas. Mr. Walsh mentioned playgrounds. Where these are used can be seen, because there is a scorched earth look to grass, to verges or to wherever it is used. Public representatives get many calls when weeds are not under control. Mr. Walsh mentioned hot foam and other methods. All of those should be used. They are better for the environment. Some Irish companies produce the chemical-free agents that local authorities could use. One in my area, VivaGreen, has many non-chemical, non-invasive products which work. Is Mr. Walsh aware of other, preferably Irish, companies that are doing that too? Mr. Walsh might answer those, then I will come back in if possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The first question is on the use of the-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	By the Department.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Public representatives and members of the public want to see weeds controlled where possible. They do not want the place to look untidy. To use Mr. Walsh's analogy, people are not looking for golf course quality, but ultimately, they do not want the place to fall into wrack and ruin. A balance is to be struck. Where local authorities could use products that are not harmful to the environment, humans or animals, we need to make sure that they do so. Alternative methods such as hot foam are fine, but we also need to encourage local authorities to explore other options. I am not necessarily hearing that from Mr. Walsh.Maybe to follow from today, the committee could write to the Department and find out first how many inspections have been happening. I heard what was said about Cork but I am suspicious that it is because of Mr. Walsh's activity that Cork was inspected last year. We need to find out how many inspections are done annually and also what kind of promotion and experiments are being done with non-chemically based products. We should find this out from the Department and then maybe we could engage with Mr. Walsh and others in a little while again. I thank the witness again for his attendance and answering the queries. Well done.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am reminding myself of the response from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Brendan Gleeson. It touches on what we talked about earlier. He speaks about pesticide use in public areas and the current situation. I note that he states that if a product authorised for professional use is intended to be used, it can be applied only by a Department-registered professional user. Going back to the non-chemical products, Mr. Walsh might be able to assist in that regard because of his experience. Senator Murphy is correct that Mr. Walsh obviously has a real grá for and an interest in the topic. It would be good to identify a number of non-chemical products that could be recommended to the Department. Ultimately, if the Department takes the lead on this, the local authorities will follow. The Department goes on to state in its response that there is best practice in responsible pesticide use in public areas. That is a guidance document the Department produces. That is one point. The second point is that the reply goes on to state that there is currently a robust EU legal framework for placing on the market the use of pesticides and that the EU is responding to the concerns of member states in a more harmonised approach to deliver fully on the ambitions of sustainable use of pesticides. In tandem with what the Department is doing, the committee, on foot of Mr. Walsh's petition, should correspond with the Department, not only about the inspections but also about whether it is trialling non-chemical products and whether it recommends them on its list for professional contractors. That might also assist because it is in line with Mr. Walsh's recommendations to the committee. One point is about the warning signs, and that is fine. Maybe an information campaign could be good, particularly around April and May every year, as the growing season comes on. Mr. Walsh said all city and county councils should adopt the same policy. I agree with him on that. He is right that if it works in one area, it should work in them all. The problem, however, going back to the Chairman's point, is manpower. We can have all the machines we want but we need people to drive them regularly. Mr. Walsh's experience in Holland is fine if they have the crews to go out regularly, but we find there are long stretches of road that do not get the attention they need and people give out about them. As I said earlier, there is a balance to be struck here. We have to be cognisant of biodiversity as well. We cannot kill everything that is growing that we do not like the look of. That is not good either. To Mr. Walsh's third point about the non-chemical alternatives, that is where he can assist, as well as the committee corresponding with the Department, to try to recommend more non-chemical-based products. Let us see whether the Department is trialling them - we do not know - and how many inspections are being undertaken. Then, when we get the response, we might engage again with Mr. Walsh.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh mentioned the Straight A’s for AMENITY booklet, which is a fair question, perhaps, to add to our letter as well. This letter to the Department is getting longer by the minute, but in fairness some of the things Mr. Walsh touched on today were not responded to or highlighted within the Department's response. Obviously, they were not highlighted in Mr. Walsh's original petition. This is coming out in our discussion, which is helpful. It would be good to know when the booklet was actually produced, however. It does not reference section 12 of SI 155 of 2012, which Mr. Walsh mentioned. It would be useful if we could establish that. Mr. Walsh is right in saying that if the booklet were updated, if it has not been already, then that could do some of the work we are actually talking about and people would be informed about what they should and should not do. Ultimately, the vast majority of people want to comply. Mr. Walsh mentioned the product. I have had experience of this in the past while. The vast majority of people are looking for non-invasive chemicals to use. They do not want to do any harm. That is where we need to make sure the Department is trialling those. If we can get those responses from the Department in that correspondence, that will help and it might inform our discussion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Cahill and Mr. Callery are very welcome. I will focus first on their opening statement, which is welcome and represents great progress. I am from the neighbouring county council area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Since 2016 onwards, there have been many similarities between what my council and Wicklow County Council have been doing. I am familiar with the work of my council. It is great to read about the work of Wicklow County Council. I commend it on the work it has done. On the AIPP, which is of interest to me, the witnesses highlighted two of the objectives it contains. In particular, they referred to making public land pollinator friendly. Can they elaborate on how that is being done? Mr. Callery mentioned the Let’s Get Buzzing event and a few other initiatives. He specifically mentioned pollinator-friendly corridors, the use of which we need to encourage. One can work in that regard with communities and Tidy Towns groups, both of which are very in tune with this and want to see this progress. On the other side of the equation, and this is something the committee has discussed, are the complaints that the council also probably receives because a pollinator-friendly corridor may look a little bit more untidy to what people may have become used to. Where signage is put up, people understand what is being done and may be encouraged to participate as a result. Can I ask the witnesses comment on that matter? On the use of chemicals and glyphosate, when mentioning the products and equipment to control weeds and clean hard surfaces, our guests specifically referred to the hiring of contractors. Let us be honest. There is a cost associated with this. It is cheaper and possibly quicker to use a chemical-based approach, but there are obviously long-term effects, whereas the cost of hiring a contractor for two days may have an immediate effect but does not have the same long-lasting effect of the weeds growing back in the next growth season. Can the witnesses comment on the costs in that regard? We need that information because we want to see this kind of initiative rolled out across the country. As the Chairman stated, this has come to us through Mr. Walsh and the work he has undertaken. Thankfully, our engagement with local authorities seems to be that they are all on the same page here. That is good news. We have to talk about the cost and the circumstances in which it is prohibitive. I understand what our witnesses are saying about circumstances where a chemical-based solution has to be used because I can see the relevant information on the application form they sent to us in advance. How many applications to use chemicals have been submitted and what level of chemicals are being used in spite of all of the good efforts that have been made? I have many other questions on these issues, but I will leave it at those for moment. I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I hear our witnesses comments on the costs, which is understandable. I raise the issue of the use of glyphosate where there are large weeds growing on the kerb sides, footpaths or whatever.Over time, they can do damage. Ms Cahill mentioned invasive species doing damage to infrastructure, etc. She mentioned colleagues in departments like roads who may want these weeds removed sooner than other people would want. She also mentioned Tidy Towns and residents groups requesting the same. Where that situation arises, what is the best practice learned so far? I accept these things will change. When pesticides or herbicides need to be used, how much have been used so far, by way of granting? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Hogweed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The chemicals being used for those-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that. It is trial and error. Ms Cahill highlighted in her statement the sharing of information both between Departments and between local authorities. She mentioned Louth, Kildare and a few others. How frequent is that sharing of information? I have personal experience of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown but others are further along the road - excuse the pun - and more aware of what things worked. Ms Cahill mentioned hot foam. When I was on the council I raised it. The cost of glyphosate versus the cost of a machine means it is a good few years of expenditure before it washes its face. Did Ms Cahill say the council bought one or is buying one?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	So it has made the investment
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Cahill said there was the appointment of an external contractor to carry out the mechanical weed removal, and it raised IR issues, which was inevitable I presume. Wicklow County Council will not be the only council with that issue. As the Chairman said, there are other options in terms of utilising or repurposing some of the council's equipment.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I return to the "Do"s and "Don't"s the council has established, which Ms Cahill raised in her opening remarks. The third point concerned the use of alternative chemicals and glyphosate-free products. We have raised this here before and I raised it with the Department when it was before the committee.What is the process for the council to procure non-chemically-based products? There is quite a large range of them on the market. What is the process in which the council engages to secure and procure those products?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There is no bulk-buying of any particular chemical-free products.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If a member of the outdoor staff decides to trial a product that is chemical-free, there will be a trial area and it might be found that it works. What happens then if the council wants to purchase the product on a large scale, given it has five municipal district areas?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. The reason I asked that has nothing to do with Wicklow specifically. It is to get our heads around the way in which we can get local authorities to explore non-chemically-based products. While there is big investment of €30,000 in Foamstream and other materials that the council has to acquire, there are products which could do what we want that are non-invasive and non-chemically based, and we should be looking at them. They may ultimately be cheaper than the products or materials the witnesses are talking about. We are going to return to that and it might be something we specifically examine in our report. I greatly appreciate the engagement of the witnesses, not only with the committee in written format, but also the oral presentation today and the engagement on this very important topic. I do not think it gets enough discussion on a national basis. With specific regard to the remits of the two witnesses, graffiti removal is costly yet there are alternative ways of getting rid of it. Does the Wicklow local authority still provide kits for graffiti removal? I know some had done so in the past but do they still do that? I know I am somewhat off-topic.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I presume it is more prominent in the north of the county than elsewhere. In saying that, what other methods are used? Is it mainly voluntary?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is really down to municipal district level. Would Mr. Callery be aware of the involvement of the Probation Service in regard to the removal of graffiti?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Would this trial period be something the council could use to engage with the Probation Service? I am thinking in terms of cost and a process in which, right across the country, local authorities which are engaging in this could be helped to avail of some manual labour through the Probation Service?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	To go back to the all-Ireland pollinator plan and best practice use of pesticides, reference was made to 77 different types of bees, for example. In tandem with what we are talking about today, and in tandem with the council’s pollinator targets as a county, how is the council monitoring the progress of that? From 2016, there has been a six-year window for monitoring the impact that the pollinator plan, “slow to mow” and all of these other initiatives are having. How are they being monitored year on year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The witnesses will be aware of the new investment with the National Parks and Wildlife Service on the encouraging of biodiversity. We have to monitor where we are going with this to ensure what we are doing and the learnings Ms Cahill is talking about are monitored so we know how we are progressing. I will move to my final questions. I again thank both witnesses for their attendance today. In terms of the pesticide course they spoke of, how many of the staff in Wicklow County Council have attended that course? One of the documents mentioned that staff have to register with the Department once the course is done. Of the members of staff who have attended the course, have they all registered? Is the council going to explore amending by-laws in this regard, or has it already done so, to try to discourage or persuade people not to use these products?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They are then registered with the Department as a matter of course.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is with a cohort who are compliant and who want to be compliant. The by-laws coming in could apply to the cohort who are not.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a fight we will stay out of. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, I have asked the questions I wanted to ask.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If there are any other elements that our guests think could contribute to that report, they might engage with the committee. We certainly would welcome any feedback they encounter in the interim. It is important for all of us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a good idea. The high growth is in the summer months so if we are going to see it in all its glory, that is an option. Perhaps with some of the councils that have responded to the clerk we might see if there is a willingness to highlight a particular area or programme they are doing or an initiative they are taking.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have no problem with that course of action. It is only right. It is to be hoped that more than two thirds of the local authorities will have responded by the next meeting. As regards the ones who have not, it would only be right for us to examine that at our next public session to see which ones have not responded.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That petition could have come from my household, by all accounts. The recommendation is a good course of action.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree with Senator Murphy's proposal. He has raised it before and it is good that he raised it again. The breadth of petitions we have just discussed shows there is an interest in and awareness of the committee. The Senator is correct that a bit of publicity for the work of the committee will bring forward other petitions.  Speaking of our role as a committee, we were sought for our experience as a committee internationally for other parliaments looking at setting up similar petitions committees. Covid got in the way of that but maybe we can look at that in our next meeting. If I recall correctly, one correspondent stated their exploration of their committee was in its infancy and, given the length of time the Oireachtas has had a petitions committee, there was interest in us sharing our experience. Members like Senators Murphy and Buttimer and Deputy Buckley had time on the previous committee. That is invaluable for other parliaments across the world to learn from best practice. I commend the work of the clerk and staff here. It is not easy, given the volume of correspondence we have received and that they also have to try to liaise with various Departments and organisations. That is much appreciated by us and by the petitioners. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If our petition on no school on Fridays takes off, we will be a very popular committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There will be a new cohort engaging with the committee. We will have one day of school in the country left, maybe.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is an extended meeting, is it not?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Chairman can send communication on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank both witnesses for their opening statements and for highlighting this issue. The power of this committee is that we can delve into these granular and important issues. As Deputy O'Donoghue said, this is our heritage. The witnesses may ask why a Deputy who represents Dún Laoghaire where there are no thatched roof cottages is speaking. Not too far from my constituency, in Stepaside and Enniskerry, there are thatched cottages but they are disappearing at a rate of knots. After spending so much time and money restoring a thatched roof, for Mr. Darby to be encouraged or advised to go with a slate roof is not where we want to be. That is the easy solution. The experience of Ms McNelis's parents has been that because their thatched property is listed, they have been almost hemmed in to a useless property, if Ms McNelis will excuse the phrase. That is not how it should be. I went through development plans when I was a councillor and they are meant to be about affording protection to these properties so they are not destroyed. That should not shackle owners and prevent them from doing anything with their property either. We either respect private property rights or we do not. I accept the point that there are not enough heritage officers. There are some who say that where there are heritage officers in place, they make the problem worse because they are not working hand in hand with owners. We need to get to a better position of respecting, protecting and encouraging thatched roofs. This is not only about the physical entity but also the thatching trade and ensuring we do not lose that skill. There is a lot to be done on this matter. The committee needs to correspond with the Department directly and I hope representatives of the Department will speak directly to us. Are the witnesses aware of any actions that have come from the 2005 report? On the insurance side and as regards providing a remedy for properties, to my mind there has been nothing done in decades and we have lost more properties than we have been able to maintain. I do not have a question per se to the witnesses, primarily because their opening statements gave us the information and exposed the problem that lies ahead. I suggest that the committee correspond promptly with the Department and that members, both individually and collectively, raise the matter with the Minister in the Dáil. Before today's meeting, I had a good discussion with a constituent who has a thatched property. He raised many of the issues we have discussed today. Unfortunately, the problem is the same no matter where in the country the property is and it is that insurance remains astronomical and unaffordable for many people. This is having an impact on the physical heritage of our landscape. I suggest we correspond with the Department and invite its representatives to appear before us to find out what it is proposing to do to ensure homeowners are encouraged to retain thatched roofs.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McDonnell for his contribution. I have several questions. Mr. McDonnell mentioned there are between 2,000 and 3,000 thatched cottages in the Republic. To go back to the 2005 report, and taking it from what the witnesses have said that there has been little or no action on that, the executive summary at action 5 stated that a centralised database should be established. I assume that has not been done and Mr. McDonnell might confirm if that is the case. Therefore, from 2005 to today, there has been no real way of assessing or quantifying how many thatched roofs we have already lost. To go back to the earlier point, not every thatched roof property is listed and, therefore, they are not listed there either. Mr. McDonnell might answer on that. I have two further questions. Senator Warfield referred to farms getting insurance if there is a thatched property on a farm. I presume that is what Mr. Darby is talking about in his opening statement when he referred to commercial-type insurance.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously, that is not an option for everybody and it does not give them the exact cover they require, but the premiums of such insurance cover, as Mr. Darby pointed out, at between €2,000 and €6,000 are astronomical. Mr. Darby might speak to that further. It is not an ideal situation for anybody. Ms McNelis said that if insurance lapsed or people could not afford it, given those types of premiums, some people are unable to even sell the property. From the experience of her group, how extensive is that problem? If it is a property on a farm or on its own land, are many of the members of the thatched property group coming across this problem regularly? Those are my three questions to the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Thank you for that, Mr. Lonergan. Deputy Buckley should feel free to come back in if he wants to. I am conscious Senator Murphy is on the line. Does he want to add anything or does he have any questions on this issue?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Thank you, Senator. I will come in on this, if I may. An application for planning was made in 2003 and here we are in 2022, coming into 2023, 20 years later and the DPI issue is still not resolved. I hear what Mr McGrath is saying about 800-odd other DPIs throughout the country and 25 within Tipperary. It is quite scary that this issue has taken the time, not to mention the cost of coming here, it has to try to be resolved. I am conscious Mr. Coskeran is in the Gallery, and I was not able to interact with him when he was a witness before this committee, but I really shudder to think why this is happening. It is bureaucracy gone mad if it is taking 20 years. I do not lay the blame fully at Tipperary County Council's door, but from 2003 up to 2014, with the establishment of Irish Water, that was a period when the issue was with Tipperary County Council. Following on from that, there was the establishment of Irish Water. I note what has been said, that there is a report being done and that the council applied for funding in 2019, three years ago. I am not sure when the report is to be done. Mr. McGrath might be able to clarify that with the Department. Surely, however, he as chief executive has to agree with me that this is not acceptable and that this has taken an inordinate amount of time. I am conscious that the five houses in Rocksprings we are speaking about are on the hook for the cost of resolution of any issue with infrastructure that would arise in the short to medium term. That is an extreme worry for people. Like Deputy Buckley and Senator Murphy and others, I would regularly deal with requests for taking in charge but rarely have I seen the buck being passed from one organisation to the next and everybody saying it is someone's fault or someone else's issue or we are waiting on this report or that investigation and this site meeting. I would be inclined to have a follow-up meeting within a month with the witnesses present from Tipperary County Council, with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, with Irish Water and with the Department.This is not just about one DPI; it is about a plethora of them and the process relating to them, which is clearly failing. Mr. McGrath listed Rocksprings as No. 4 on the list of priorities for the county. That is to be welcomed, but I shudder to think about what will happen to the priorities from No. 5 all the way through to No. 25 if this is the pace at which these matters are going to be resolved. They cannot all come before the Oireachtas for negotiation. I hope that a streamlined process can be put in place between Irish Water and all of the local authorities to which the 800-odd DPIs relate. Mr. McGrath might come back to me in terms of the timeframe for the deliberation on this report. Ultimately, what kind of timeframe does he envisage in the context of finding a resolution to this issue after 20 years.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McGrath for that clarification in terms of the six-year period. He is right; it is too long, even at six years. That said, and the fact that there is no possibility of providing a timeframe at this juncture, I am conscious that this issue could rumble on for another year for more. Is there any option of even a partial takeover of other services in the interim while the DPI issue is resolved? I am not sure if Mr. McGrath can elaborate on that. On the cost to Tipperary County Council in terms of hours associated with this issue, be it on-site or the need to engage with Irish Water or the EPA. I imagine the cost to the council on this site - Mr. McGrath mentioned that there are 25 such sites in total - is costing Tipperary County Council quite a bit of time and money. I also imagine that it is a distraction in the context of the other work the council needs to be doing vis-à-vis housing, etc. In the absence of a timeframe, we could easily be here in six or 12 months' time and the matter would not have progressed any further. I acknowledge Mr. McGrath's comprehensive and transparent statement and his willingness and eagerness to resolve the issue. I commend Mr. Coskeran's patience in trying to navigate the quagmire that seems to be in existence between local government, Irish Water and the EPA. Mr. McGrath might come back on those points and then I will let Deputy Buckley back in.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McGrath. A note would be helpful - certainly in January. if possible - in order to give the committee an indication of how it is progressing. We will take Mr. McGrath up on that offer. On the issue of a partial taking in charge, I do not know if that is one of the interim solutions that could be considered.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. In terms of the taking-in-charge process, which we are probably all familiar with on this committee, maybe there is the potential for those services the council is in control of to be taken in charge. I assume that the latter would not satisfy Mr. Coskeran. However, it would certainly give some comfort to the residents of the five properties if they were in some way indemnified in the context of issues with other types of infrastructure. I will leave that point to Mr. McGrath. He might send a note to the committee on that when he is providing the briefing, which will be very welcome, in January. I will now hand back to Deputy Buckley.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. McGrath for that. I agreed in his absence that would we have the briefing note and update from Tipperary County Council. However I am looking at our schedule and January would be helpful. We would have a meeting ourselves either on 18 January or 25 January, more probably the 18 January. Will Mr. McGrath commit to providing that update for our meeting on 18 January if that is possible?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	For the purpose of the minutes, depending on what kind of update we receive in January, there was also a proposal to have a joint meeting whereby we would request Irish Water, Tipperary County Council, the Department and the EPA, if required, to attend a joint session here early in the new year.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise that I will not be able to stay long as I am expected in the Chamber shortly. I thank the Ministers of State and their officials for coming before the committee to discuss this. We had good engagement with witnesses in the past and I welcome them to the Public Gallery again. This is an important issue and I acknowledge the work the Ministers of State have undertaken since our meeting in September in engaging directly with the Thatch Property Insurance Action Group. I note some positive statements from the remarks made by both Ministers of State. With respect to the insurance element, I understand what the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, said about the limited number of operators and the limited choice. There is perhaps some light at the end of the tunnel as regards opportunities, especially in the commercial area but, as my colleague stated, the biggest issue is that some people are relying on a commercial insurance policy that is not fit for a residential property. That poses all kinds of challenges for them. Equally, the announcement of a further grant and assistance for people to avail of by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is welcome. However, I do not detect a sense of urgency or concern. The Ministers of State mentioned that approximately 490 people responded to the survey, which is quite good. He stated it was about one quarter. Did the Minister of State state there are approximately 2,000 thatched properties in the country? I expected the number to be higher. Nonetheless, regardless of how many there are, in our previous engagement on this matter, I asked about the database that has been spoken about for many years. Will the Minister of State inform the committee regarding its status? It is important that all the owners of these properties, who are custodians, as the Minister of State correctly put it, have an opportunity to link with one another and that the combined problems they face can be dealt with. In fairness to the Ministers of State and their Departments, there is a willingness to try to resolve these issues. No one wants to see thatched properties disappear. I certainly do not want to see any more disappear. The other element of this is the planning side.We are dealing with planning on a wider scale at present. However, I hope that when people go to redesign or refurbish a thatched property that a sympathetic eye will be turned to the fact that we want to ensure that we retain these properties in their current format by the architectural conservation officers in the respective local authorities and by the planners. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, also mentioned a committee has been established and that a thatcher is chairing it and there is another thatcher on the committee, which is very welcome because we need to ensure we have that expertise. We also said at this committee in September that we wanted to retain the skillset in this country to ensure we can protect these properties. The Ministers of State might respond to those few questions. Unfortunately I have to take my leave of the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, come in on the question about the insurance industry?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is a fair point and I agree with that.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	Good afternoon members and welcome to our witnesses. The next speaker is Deputy Matt Shanahan.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	I had intended to speak from the floor, but the Chairman has sent his apologies because he is going to speak in the Dáil shortly. I, too, thank the witnesses for coming in and for sharing their experiences. Obviously, a number of people are part of the campaign. Deputy Higgins just mentioned the sizeable petition and the number of signatories. I can empathise with the witnesses' situation. They spoke passionately of their fond memories as children of St. Brigid's and their personal experiences and loss. So many families not just in County Tipperary but also in the wider area will have experienced similar loss. Palliative care is important. We cannot underestimate the value of that type of care. I represent Dún Laoghaire and in my own area a step-down facility closed not too long ago. We are in the process of determining whether that facility may be repurposed for the benefit of primary care or indeed other healthcare services. From my understanding, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, but St. Brigid's is currently being used as a community healthcare centre. There was also talk of a diabetes clinic being opened. I should declare that I am the Chair of the Oireachtas cross-party diabetes committee. I know, from our experience, that there is a need for better facilities for those with diabetes. That being said, the group's campaign is nonetheless important because of the amount of people who obviously feel great attachment to St. Brigid's. I know that a lot of questions have been asked of the witnesses. There will be a broad recap of the questions posed. Deputy Higgins mentioned the Joint Committee on Health. I think the group has engaged with the committee. Perhaps the witnesses can clarify that for us. This is my first engagement with the Save St. Brigid's Action Group. How many people are in the group? Is one of the witnesses the chairperson or secretary of the group? Who has that enviable job? The witnesses have mentioned that St. Brigid's closed in April 2020. In terms of the group's meetings to date and practical steps taken, in that period the group has met with the HSE directly and it handed a petition to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, outside Leinster House. I am sure there have been other meetings. I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that. As I have said in our private meetings, I personally feel that the Joint Committee on Health is probably a better fit for where the group is at in terms of the campaign. That being said, this committee also hears issues of public concern, and there is clearly concern around the closure of St. Brigid's. Moving back to the role of Acting Chairperson, in terms of the questions that have been asked by various colleagues, including Deputy Cahill and others, I ask the witnesses to respond at their leisure. I do not know who wants to go first.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	I was just wondering whether our guests have had meetings with the HSE.
CormacDevlin	 Vice Chairman	2020-02-08	None	Our guests might also take the other questions that were asked. I acknowledge some of the contributions were statements rather than questions, but they might wish to respond to some of them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Deputy Higgins touched on some of the questions I was going to raise. Before I ask other questions, though, I am glad that Deputy McGrath is present. As someone who is meant to be an impartial Chair, I ask the Chairman to question Deputy McGrath's statement about people covering for one another. It was unfair to the officials and to the Member, who was not in the room at the time. I ask that it be withdrawn by the Deputy and that the Chairman ensure that is done.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is not fair.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am a member of this committee, Deputy.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Standing Order still obtains. The comment should be withdrawn.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to ask questions of the witnesses. We had a beneficial engagement with members of the action group previously. I can understand the concern, emotion and involvement of the local community on this issue. Everyone is attached to his or her local health service. For Carrick-on-Suir, this seems to be an extremely personal situation. For example, we heard from the action group of personal experiences with St. Brigid's. I appreciate all of that. The contribution by Ms Killeen White and her colleagues today has been interesting in that it has provided a little more explanation about the decisions that have been taken. In my questioning at our previous meeting, I had some regard to the HIQA report. Many statements have been made. For example, Ms Killeen White referred today to the "dedication, commitment and excellent care" provided at St. Brigid's. That must be noted. It was also noted in the HIQA report. The action group highlighted that just one or two elements of the report were given as reasons for closure. In the group's eyes, those reasons were not sufficient. According to the information provided by Ms Killeen White and her colleagues today, though, the hospital was not safe in a modern context. Ms Killeen White just told my colleague Deputy Higgins that the hospital was not suitable as a Covid treatment centre. I believe Ms Killeen White stated that one patient had been admitted to it. Now, the hospital has been morphed into a new health centre or hub, as it were. Ms Killeen White mentioned diabetes and administrative care. Have staff members lost their employment as a result of the changes at St. Brigid's or is the staffing level the same?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the new centre adjacent to the hospital?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the hospital's reconfiguration and the new services being provided on the campus, what is the short-to-medium-term plan for the building?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ms Killeen White mentioned the new 20 palliative care beds. Obviously, they will not be in Tipperary and will instead be located just across the border in, I believe, Waterford. Those services are being availed of. I am glad to hear someone from the HSE acknowledging the great work being done in palliative care. People would be lost without that care, in particular the outreach programmes. I represent Dún Laoghaire in Dublin. Our local hospice was recently redeveloped, which placed a significant strain on services. Thankfully, Our Lady's Hospice was able to continue providing its excellent care through the outreach service, supplemented by the Wicklow Hospice. At our previous meeting, the action group acknowledged the fantastic care provided to residents and patients at St. Brigid's. Deputy McGrath has left. I thank the Chair for his intervention in the matter, but it is unfortunate the Deputy would not withdraw the remarks. The Deputy mentioned that, contrary to the Minister of State's comment, the building was less than 200 years of age. I believe he said it was 180 years old. In Ms Killeen White's remarks, though, she referred to 1817, which would make it 206 years old. Is that correct? Was it a workhouse that later became a healthcare facility?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to ask Mr. Ruane about his involvement. Everyone present is trying to do his or her best. The officials have attended to try to explain what is happening from their perspective, and the committee appreciates that. We have been debating this issue for quite some time and it is good to hear the official side as well as the community side. Unfortunately, I do not believe we will be successful at this meeting in reaching an amicable resolution between the two sides. However, I hope a solution that each views as workable can be found. It will not be easily done.Mr. Ruane mentioned the plans, and the Chair referenced the floodplain and everything else. What are the plans in the short to medium term for the future prospects of the overall campus? I heard Ms Killeen White talk about the administrative side, diabetic care and everything else. What is the vision for the overall campus in the short to medium term?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that in St. Anthony's?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Did Ms McDaid say it would be a minimum, not maximum, of two beds?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No one better than Deputy Cahill. Fair play to him. I will focus on the holistic care in St. Brigid's itself, and public and private nursing home care. It was referenced in the opening statement that there are 147 HSE beds across four units and 522 private nursing home beds across 13 private providers. Is their use at full capacity at present? How has it been since the restrictions eased? That obviously meant a return to somewhat normal levels.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have two final questions. Reference was made to ongoing recruitment. I think the term "24 whole equivalents" was used for existing staff but there are a number of vacancies. The opening statement referenced the fact that the physiotherapist clinical specialist post is currently vacant, as is the senior physiotherapist post. It is no secret that there are gaps in recruitment and retention issues right across the service, as well as issues in trying to recruit the correct staff for the correct locations. How long have the advertised posts been vacant? Are these new or replacement posts? What is their current status?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The new posts are obviously good news. How long have they been advertised?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. How many of the replacement posts are currently vacant?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I again thank the witnesses for their contributions. Like others, I have a contribution to make in the Chamber but it has been very worthwhile to get the information. I very much thank the officials for their time. I appreciate it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I also congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his re-election. In this, my maiden speech, I congratulate all my 159 colleagues on their election. I wish the other 47 who have been given the privilege and honour to represent their constituents in this House for the first time well in the Thirty-third Dáil. I also thank my family and the people of Dún Laoghaire for the support they gave me to be elected to this House on 8 February. It is an enormous privilege for anybody to serve in this House, and particularly as a new Deputy, on their first day to be casting a vote for somebody who wishes to lead this country, to be Taoiseach. To have a say in that brings home the enormous responsibility that each one of us has ahead of us. For that reason I support the candidacy of Úachtarán Fhianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin. Today almost all Deputies have mentioned the word "change. It is the buzzword. In 2016, "new politics" were the buzzwords. Change has been mentioned ad nauseam today. More than 418,000 people gave Fianna Fáil their first preference vote. They voted for change and they want Fianna Fáil to lead a government of change. I believe Fianna Fáil will participate in forming a government that will deliver the change required by the public. As a public representative for Dún Laoghaire since 2004, I have witnessed our leader, Deputy Martin, as a Minister deliver change in the North, build bridges across communities. Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned that, as Minister for Health, he delivered on the smoking ban in public places. I also recall his reforming ways as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In 2016, Deputy Martin delivered change in this House because a minority Government of that nature was unheard of at that time. I trust that in 2020 Deputy Martin will deliver the change the people have asked for. I wish him and my colleagues well in their deliberations over the weeks ahead. It will be challenging but it is incumbent on all of us to rise to that challenge and deliver the change the people have asked for. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking these statements and listening to the concerns of Members. I acknowledge the efforts of our public servants, particularly the medical staff encountering the spread of Covid-19 throughout the country. It has not, thankfully, yet been widespread but in monitoring what has happened in other jurisdictions, we may be at the beginning of something in this country. I hope I am wrong on that. I also acknowledge the efforts of others across the country, in particular the Garda, teachers, transport workers, front-line service workers and workers in shops, hotels and other service industries for their co-operation and assistance during this period. As mentioned earlier by our spokesperson on health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, general communication has been good. I call, however, for more of an open approach, particularly regarding the identification of certain areas. I do not refer to individuals because we need to protect individual identities. We need people to self-identify and we do not want to put that in jeopardy but we need to trust the public. Public health must be our main concern in all of this, and it should be our top priority at all costs.  The HPSC had identified nine cases so far but that could be ten from what we are hearing this evening. I express my solidarity to those families and individuals concerned because it is worrying for them and their communities. The public expects a plan to deal with community transmission when that happens. That needs to be forthcoming. Unfortunately, I found the Minister's statement earlier a little light on detail. I know this is an unfolding issue for him and his officials, but we need to reassure the public with more detail of the Government's future plans regarding the coronavirus. In China, 80% of the cases were mild, 15% needed treatment in hospital while 5% required intensive care treatment. On that basis, the Minister’s earlier announcement of just 20 intensive care beds is entirely insufficient, and I fear it may feed public concern. I also welcome the establishment of the Cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate our national response. The Government must show leadership on this issue. Constitutionally, the appropriate body to exercise such power is the Government, not an ad hoc committee of the House. I welcome the guidelines put before the House earlier. The regulations to prevent the stockpiling of sanitised or medical products should be put in place. Vulnerable individuals must be guaranteed access to such products.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My question concerns the Covid-19 emergency unemployment payment. I have been contacted, as I am sure other Deputies have, by people who are over the age of 66 and are either employed or self-employed. Many of these people have faced financial hardship and they are not entitled to that payment. I am wondering if the Minister has costed that payment.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister to the House today. I will leave time at the end of my questions for him to answer them. At the outset, I pay tribute to the front-line transport workers who have kept Ireland moving throughout this pandemic and I ask the Minister to pass on our praise and thanks to them through his offices. In relation to the taxsaver scheme, I acknowledge the National Transport Authority, NTA's role in ensuring that over 60,000 commuters will be compensated. This is only fair. I thank the NTA for the speed in which it dealt with that query. I also acknowledge the role and innovation of many local authorities right across the country, including my own of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which have responded to the needs of cyclists and pedestrians during this period. Businesses across the country are taking steps to ensure employees and indeed their customers are physically distanced when they reopen on Monday next. Supermarkets have made great strides in providing gloves and hand sanitisers at the point of entry into their premises.Some are even washing down shopping trolleys between use by one customer and the next.  What contingencies has the Government put in place to protect the public and limit the spread and transmission of Covid-19 as businesses reopen and the public starts using public transport, mainly the DART, Luas and Dublin Bus services, during the first stage of the lifting of restrictions next week? Will masks and hand sanitisers be provided to commuters? Will bus carriages and the buses themselves be sanitised between uses and between journeys, as is the case in many other countries across the world? If we expect members of the public to use public transport, they have to know it is safe to do so. That assurance needs to come from the Department.  Finally, I ask the Minister to make a statement about those over the age of 70 whose driver licences require renewal and about the national car test, NCT, which was not addressed in his speech.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will leave some time at the end of our remarks for answers. If the Minister does not have time to respond, she might correspond with me. As we heard, Covid-19 has fundamentally changed Ireland's economic and social landscape. At the end of 2019, 2.5 million people were at work by contrast with today, when there are over 1.25 million people in receipt of income supports. The State is likely to run a deficit of around €30 billion for 2020, and reigniting our economy will present significant challenges. A business-as-usual, one-size-fits-all approach will not work. Employers, employees and sectors that remain closed owing to the Government's health advice should have certainty that the income supports will be maintained for the period in question. We need to see changes to the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme to allow for more flexibility to support the workers. For example, workers should be allowed to return to companies to work part time where possible. The Government should support working schemes or incentives whereby staff are allowed to work from home. Long-term unemployment is a genuine prospect, especially for the 120,000 who are under 25. That needs to be tackled, particularly for those in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment. We need an ambitious plan to retrain and reskill those workers who unfortunately lost their jobs during this pandemic. Any measures that are put in place must deliver an inclusive recovery. I previously raised in this House the discriminatory aspects of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the PUP. While the Minister referred to some changes in her speech, it is important that we see some changes. The arrangements are deeply unfair on women returning to work from maternity leave in that they cannot access the temporary wage subsidy scheme. The criteria are equally discriminatory against those over the age of 66. Will the Minister commit to rectifying deficiencies in these schemes to ensure an inclusive recovery in which no one is left behind?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would appreciate if the Minister could arrange for officials to respond to any of the questions he does not have time to answer after my remarks. Covid-19 has fundamentally changed Ireland's economic and social landscape. At the end of 2019, an average of 2.3 million people were at work. Today, almost 1.2 million people are in receipt of income supports. We are being asked to approve the €6.84 billion Estimate to continue income supports. The State is likely to run a €30 billion deficit for 2020. Reigniting our economy will present significant challenges, as we all know, and a business as usual, one size fits all approach will not work. It is estimated that 2.1 million people will eventually return to work, approximately 90% of pre-Covid levels. That 90% will present challenges, and those 10% who do not return to work cannot be left behind. Our first step should be to reassure people in sectors that remain closed on Government advice that they will continue to be supported.Talk of winners and losers is not helpful and I urge people to stop using socially divisive language. We are all in this together and the public is very much in tune with that. We must also do everything to support existing jobs. We need changes to the pandemic unemployment payment and wage subsidy schemes, about which I have spoken in this Chamber previously, to allow for more flexibility and support for new work practices. Where possible, workers should be allowed to return to their companies part-time and the Government should support work-sharing schemes. Incentives should be put in place to support those working from home. Critical industries such as tourism, hospitality and our bus and coach industry need support. We should encourage employment by these industries by cutting the VAT rate and providing other supports. The next Government must prepare an inclusive social and economic recovery plan. We must invest in people. Anyone who has lost his or her job as a result of this pandemic must be given support and the opportunity to retrain and reskill. The risk of long-term unemployment is real, especially for the 120,000 young people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment. The back to education allowance must be opened to anyone in receipt of pandemic income supports. We need to see an ambitious capital programme that takes advantage of low-cost borrowing to invest in infrastructure. Now is the time to invest in green infrastructure such as the Sutton to Sandycove cycleway in my constituency and greenways right across the country. The single biggest investment, however, must be in public housing. We need an ambitious plan to build thousands of homes.  Any measures put in place must deliver an ambitious recovery in which no one is left behind. Will the Minister commit to ensuring an inclusive recovery in which no one is left behind?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I take this opportunity to record my utmost concern at the ongoing situation in the US, as the Minister has done. The death of George Floyd has shocked and disgusted us all. Brutality should have no place in a modern society. Subsequent events, particularly the treatment of peaceful protesters, have compounded the problem. A quote from Dr. Martin Luther King comes to mind: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." The rights of peaceful protesters must be upheld. An Garda Síochána is at the heart of upholding the rights of those in the communities that its officers serve.Our community gardaí do great work, much of it unnoticed. I thank the gardaí in my constituency in the community policing unit for their tremendous efforts, in particular during this pandemic. They led the way in the early stages when they helped vulnerable people get groceries and prescriptions. They also assisted with the excellent work of the Community Call service operated by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with the assistance of sports clubs such as Cuala and other groups. I thank everyone involved in this superb community initiative. One of the positives of the pandemic has been the increased Garda visibility across our communities. I hope this will continue throughout the summer. Covid-19 restrictions have been difficult, in particular for the cocooners. I wish to put on record our appreciation to them because they have had a very difficult few months. Equally, our young people have had to go through tough times, with no schooling, no examinations, no part-time work and so on. Many of them want only to hang-out with their friends and understandably so. However, since the easing of restrictions the public has witnessed large gatherings in parks, fields and open spaces. The Garda is doing its best to deal with this and the impact the continued restrictions are having must be considered by Government. Where possible, the Government should allow sports clubs to begin training again and to run summer camps as these provide vital activities for our young people. Shutting down activities for another two or three months is not acceptable. In my view, it would be a recipe for disaster. I ask the Minister to raise these concerns and those of my colleagues with the National Public Health Emergency Team and his colleagues in Cabinet.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the annual transition statements on climate action today. Since I represent the maritime county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, it is an issue close to my heart. The marine sector is a vital part of Ireland's economy and of our culture as an island nation. Protecting and maintaining the quality of our oceans is a pressing concern for the long-term health of this State. Harvested from the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Irish seafood products are some of the most outstanding in the world but if we are to maintain this distinction, we must do more to protect our seas. In my constituency, Dún Laoghaire, community activists such as Margaret Brown and young environmentalist Flossie Donnelly have done tremendous work leading volunteers and cleaning regularly the coastline in the area. I hope the Minister will join me in commending those individuals on the work they have done. The council equally supports their role, as is evident from its having secured recently blue flag status for Seapoint. Seapoint is a special protected area, by EU designation, for biodiversity purposes. It is disappointing, however, that Killiney remains without a blue flag. Just recently, we heard that Merrion Strand in Dublin failed to meet EU standards for the fifth year in a row. It is simply not good enough. Nationally, we need greater emphasis on protecting our marine biosphere. We have a moral and economic obligation to protect and enhance the immense natural resources of our waters for future generations. Ireland has specific legally binding EU obligations in regard to achieving good environmental standards in our seas. I note the Minister did not mention this in his remarks. The international targets set for Ireland are to have 10% of our waters protected by the end of this year and 30% by the end of 2030. Currently, just 2% of Irish waters are protected. This is the second lowest percentage in the European Union. The next Government must remedy this. I support the actions to strengthen Ireland's role in protecting natural oceanic resources for future generations. Would the Minister agree that a first step in protecting the ecosystems would be to introduce an oceans Act to safeguard Ireland's seas and oceans with a protected marine area?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have three brief comments not related to sport but they are pertinent to the Minister when he is in the Chamber. On 13 May I raised with the Minister the matter of face coverings on public transport and he will have heard today about the World Health Organization recommendations. Has the Minister changed his mind on this or will clearer guidance be given? It is essential that face coverings be worn while a person is on public transport. The second matter relates to people over 70 who are receiving appointments from the National Driver Licence Service but who are still being turned away. The information on the website is very unclear so I would like the Minister to look into the matter. My third comment relates to the national car test centres, where I am led to believe people are being charged a full amount instead of a recheck fee. Will the Minister provide clarity on those matters and commit to dealing with them? Perhaps the Department might liaise with me on that. Covid-19 has had a detrimental impact on elite and grassroots sports in Ireland. We are all keen on sport and want to see it thrive or flourish. Many clubs in my constituency have seen an impact from the crisis and missed vital training and competition opportunities. They face serious issues of funding because of the effects of the virus and national ticket sales, media rights revenues and memberships have all dried up. Sporting participants and volunteers have, equally, lost out in training and other regular activities. Sport is an integral part of Irish life and our communities. We all work hard for our clubs. My colleague mentioned the resilience fund set up in New Zealand so I wonder will the Minister give a commitment on that. I am thinking particularly of our elite athletes and those who will compete in Tokyo but who will have to wait another year to do so. Will the Minister confirm what actions will be taken to support elite athletes and sporting clubs around the country?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for being here and answering questions. I express my sympathies once again to the 1,709 families who have lost loved ones since the Covid pandemic began. I also recognise the more than 25,000 people who have contracted the virus in the Republic thus far. I want to put on record my appreciation of the front-line workers for the care and skill they have shown and assistance they have given to people throughout this pandemic. I also want to put on record my appreciation for the cleansing, catering and retail staff for their efforts throughout. Special mention should go to the transport companies that have kept things moving across the island throughout the crisis. I have previously raised the following issue with the Minister and seek clarity on it. I know the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is meeting tomorrow and there will be further discussions about the reopening and lifting of restrictions but there are still many questions for many sectors of the economy, businesses and individuals. There are only eight working days left until the reopening and lifting of restrictions on 29 June. People are still unsure about the permitted sizes of family gatherings and weddings and whether they should be indoors or outdoors. We have heard today that about the potential lifting of restrictions for public houses as social distancing requirements fall from 2 m to 1 m. I believe the guidelines that were issued have recently been rescinded. There are only eight working days left in which to give clarity to businesses. That clarity needs to be given and, hopefully, today. We have discussed the reopening of hairdressers many times in this Chamber but it is necessary. I believe the date of 29 June was given for that reopening and the Minister might clarify that. There is also the issue of drive-in cinemas. There are ambiguities in the legislation for something as bespoke and unique as drive-in cinemas. We need clarity about that. I turn to consider St. Augustine's school in Blackrock in my constituency. The Minister is familiar with this special school because he has dealt with it over the past number of years. I understand there is a lack of funding for St. John of God, the organisation that runs the school, and that four clinical staff - two psychologists, a speech and language therapist and a social worker - may have to be redeployed. I ask the Minister to give clarity on that either in the House today or in correspondence. The latest correspondence I received from the Minister on this matter contained reassurances that the HSE would ensure that a review would take place as soon as possible. That was in 2017. The correspondence stated that, until the review is complete, the HSE would not permit any reductions or other changes in services at St. Augustine's. That issue has arisen again. Parents are understandably wary and need clarity on that matter.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I extend my sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of the late Detective Garda Colm Horkan. His death was a reminder to all of us of the stark risks members of the Garda face day in, day out. Covid-19 has highlighted the shortcomings and failures of the supports for victims of domestic violence. Restrictions on movement, as my colleagues have just said, have magnified the crisis. The Garda has reported an increase in domestic violence cases of 30%. Women's Aid has also reported an increase in calls to its centres. The number of refuge spaces in Ireland is well below what we are obliged to provide under the Istanbul Convention. That convention obliges Ireland to provide spaces for victims in line with its population. Tusla has incorrectly claimed there is a need for one refuge space for every 10,000 adult women. However, the obligation is for one space for every 10,000 adults. Based on this, Ireland should have 472 spaces available, yet it has only 141. In 2018, Safe Ireland reported victims of domestic violence were turned away on 3,256 occasions. That is nine requests per day unanswered. Thousands of women and children were turned away from the centres and their services because of a lack of funding. These services were at breaking point. Over the past 11 years in Dún Laoghaire, my constituency, I have sought to have a centre for women victims of domestic violence. Sadly, that service has not yet materialised and women are forced to go to either Bray or Tallaght, where services are available. When questioned, local authorities point at Tusla, yet only last week the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government blamed local authorities. This pass-the-parcel approach must end. It is unacceptable. Budget 2020 failed to provide additional funding for the victims of domestic violence. Spaces are limited, particularly during this pandemic. It is clear the Government has failed victims of domestic violence. The next Government must provide more funding for them and afford them access to emergency accommodation when needed. I welcome the commitment in the draft programme for Government, especially regarding the immediate review of the accommodation provision. According to Tusla, there are 60 service providers in the sector, yet the service level varies from area to area. Access to support for victims of domestic violence should not be based on a postcode lottery.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I congratulate the Minister on his recent appointment. I know it is one of the most challenging roles in Government. I look forward to working closely with him during the term ahead. The additional expenditure of €2 billion for the health services illustrates the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our health services. Clearly, the additional resources are welcome and necessary, as we heard in the Minister's speech earlier. During the first few months of the pandemic, the previous Government introduced a range of precautionary measures such as the takeover of private hospitals. This was welcome and necessary. It is clear that it is no longer necessary and I welcome the ending of the HSE's contract with the private providers today. This will allow private hospitals to return to providing services.  As we begin the reopening of the health system, I ask the Minister to prioritise supports for people with disabilities who are on waiting lists and for their families. Obviously, we need to reduce those lists. As the Minister and all other Members will be aware, we have all been contacted by, for example, elderly parents who are gravely concerned about their children or adult family members with intellectual or physical disabilities, whether in regard to respite or accommodation needs.I ask the Minister to respond to me, perhaps after this session, about the current plans for funding of these vital services for the remainder of 2020. The Minister will be aware that I spoke to him previously about section 39 funding, in particular for convalescence and step-down services for elderly people. I ask the Minister and the Department to respond again to me about the planned funding for the remainder of this year for that very important area. Covid-19 has resulted in soaring waiting lists for inpatient and outpatient services. The latest figures show outpatient waiting lists increasing to 575,863 during May alone, while the inpatient day case waiting list now stands at 86,946. I know the Minister spoke about that himself many times, but this underlines the necessity of getting services in hospitals back up and running. I would welcome clarity from the Minister on those issues.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening with the new Government in place. It is good to hit the ground running. This is essential legislation, as my colleague has just said. We have all received many calls from businesses across the country which are in need of a roadmap. There are roadmaps for health and schools, as we discussed earlier, and now there is a roadmap for business. This is an ambitious plan and the Bill will hopefully pass within the week. I urge my colleagues in the House to support this suite of measures. It is essential that we see it passed through this House and the Upper House. The Bill is ambitious and has a broad scope. It will be welcomed. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the future growth loan scheme are essential tools in recovering Ireland's economic prospects. This legislation is significant because it will see the expansion of the future growth loan scheme which has proven to be extremely popular among small and medium enterprises. For example, €11 million in lending was approved from the loan fund at the end of March for almost 400 small businesses across the economy. That is the first step. As the Taoiseach said earlier, we are looking at a July stimulus which we hope will be in place by the end of July. It is essential that it is. We need to ensure that businesses have certainty. In a pandemic, as we know, many people feel uncertain about their future. Sadly, there are people who have lost their jobs. Businesses want to reopen but cannot do so. There are challenges there. There are many other minute issues, some of which date to before Covid and some have arisen because of Covid. This Bill will go a long way to assisting those businesses and giving them the certainty they require. The future growth loan scheme which was launched in 2019 provides loans of up to €3 million with terms of up to ten years to SMEs, including farmers and fishers. There was a rapid uptake of this €300 million scheme by SMEs with a broad reach across all sectors and regions, including for local family businesses, which is essential. The Government recently announced €200 million in lending, which was made available through the future growth loan scheme. This is a proven scheme that has worked. This Bill will see its expansion and it is essential that that happens. As I said earlier about the July stimulus package, we will hear about the many measures contained in it from the Minister and his colleagues. It is essential, however, that we see a green light for this Bill, which we will hopefully be discussing tomorrow and over the next few days. I welcome any further clarification the Minister might have but it is essential that we see it passed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Covid-19 has fundamentally changed Ireland's social and economic landscape. At the end of 2019 almost 2.3 million people were at work. Today approximately 1 million people are on some form of income support. We knew that reigniting our economy after the Covid shutdown would present significant challenges. The message from small businesses, though, is clear. They want supports. They do not want to take on additional debt. They want grants. It is important that this distinction is made. What confirmation can the Tánaiste give to the House on the plans to have SMEs reopen and get people back to work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome and support the initiatives announced to date. They have been much needed by the businesses the Tánaiste speaks of. I also welcome and support the July stimulus package. I reiterate, however, the difference between the grant aid scheme and the loan scheme. Equally, I ask the Tánaiste to focus on the under 25s. Approximately 250,000 people aged under 25 are unemployed, and I hope his Department will focus on that cohort too. It is now just four working days until the start date of the next phase of the reopening of the economy, and businesses need clarity on this. They need to order stock, train staff and prepare their premises. Can the Tánaiste confirm when they can expect such clarity?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. It is important there is a balance between the two. I wish to reiterate and focus on the fact that it is estimated that 2.1 million people will return to work. That is approximately 90% of the pre-Covid number of people in employment. That 90% has presented and, I have no doubt, will present challenges over the coming months, but the 10% who are expected not to return to work must not be left behind. As I said earlier, I would focus on the under 25s. We do not want to see young people long-term unemployed if at all possible. We need to look at schemes and initiatives to get them back to work as quickly as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I congratulate the Minister of State present, Deputy O'Donovan, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on their appointments. I thank the Minister of State for taking the question this afternoon. There is a 360 ha site in Cherrywood that is a strategic development zone in Dublin, in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. It has a rich history, with several ancient monuments, buildings, ruins of the Tully church and two stone crosses. Given the construction of the new town centre and associated housing in the area, will the Minister confirm what role the Office of Public Works, OPW, has in the preservation and protection of those historic buildings, the monuments and artifacts within that strategic development zone? What are the plans of the OPW both during and after construction?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is a reply I look forward to getting and circulating. This highlights the point that these historical monuments, artifacts and buildings at Cherrywood are in real danger. I acknowledge the work of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and, as its cathaoirleach in 2017, I tried to propose a committee at the council involving the National Monuments Service, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the council and other agencies such as the OPW. That was not forthcoming.I know now from that response the reason that was the case. However, I want to highlight for the Minister of State, and I appreciate his work on it, that according to a noted historian, Brian Mac Aongusa, Tully Church was the site of an early Christian community founded in the 6th century, which operated for almost 1,000 years until it fell into ruin in 1613. The elements of the current building date to the 12th century and include important elements of Norman architecture, including a perfectly preserved Romanesque chancel arch. The site is also the location of two standing stone crosses thought to date from the 10th century. It is of utmost importance that we find out which Department is engaging with the county council because in recent correspondence I received from Dún-Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council I have been informed that geophysical surveys were to be undertaken and on-site meetings were to take place. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could ask his officials to confirm the number of on-site visits that have taken place and keep me informed of the progress on-site.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I concur with the Minister on what is proposed in the Bill. As he said, the Government recently passed the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 which puts protections in place for tenants, particularly in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It makes it unlawful to evict people who are impacted by the pandemic until 11 January 2021, a welcome provision. It also introduces new protections for those tenants who have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. It is targeted and focused law which provides short-term and long-term measures to protect those tenants who have experienced rent arrears and hardship as a result of the pandemic. Where a tenant makes a written declaration that the economic impact of Covid-19 puts his or her tenancy at risk, the Act provides protection for them. It prohibits rent increases where tenants are impacted by the pandemic and are in receipt of income support or rent supplement. In the long term, the new law mandates that before a notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can be served, a tenant has a further 28 days to pay any outstanding rent. This is a welcome measure and one which has assisted many individuals. The involvement of the Residential Tenancies Board at an early stage will help tenants vindicate their rights and help prevent evictions. It is important that the proposers of this Bill recognise the recently passed Act because it provides many protections. These include the swift resolution by the Residential Tenancies Board on hearing disputes between tenants on deposits and the reform of the fair deal scheme to incentivise renting out vacant properties, a particular issue in my constituency. I question the Bill's constitutionality and will be opposing it. While I am open to all considerations to assist renters, any Bill put before the House must be focused, targeted and sustainable, as well as constitutionally sound. Accordingly, I will not be supporting the Bill.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My question relates to the much-needed extension to the Luas green line from Bride’s Glen and Cherrywood. I note that the extension of the Luas lines to Bray, Lucan, Poolbeg and Finglas was included in the National Transport Authority’s 2016 transport strategy for Dublin, and news that the Finglas line is proceeding is welcome. However, residents in the other areas are wondering where they stand. In particular, will the Minister provide an update on the status of the extension to the Luas line from Bray?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Residents across Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and not just in the Bray area, want to see delivery on public transport improvements. I note what the Minister has said about BusConnects and DART+, which is very welcome. However, development is currently taking place in areas such as Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood and Old Conna, to name but a few. I estimate some 50,000 people will be living and working in that area over the next few years. Development plans were agreed on the basis that public transport would be upgraded, along with the extension to the green line. There were three preferred routes back in 2006 and any delays to projects such as the Luas link to Bray or the construction of the new Woodbrook DART station, on which I have another question today, would put serious pressure on the road network. Something needs to happen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	While I agree with the Minister's view about future development, the development plans are under way and I hope the Minister's office will contact the relevant local authorities. As I mentioned, the Cabinteely, Carrickmines, Cherrywood, Shankill and northern Bray area has enormous development already planned and, on the back of that, it is anticipated public transport will be delivered. In fact, many of the developments that have happened are on the back of the idea that public transport will be delivered in those areas. One of those projects is the Luas green line, the B2 line, which, as I said, had three options. People want a high-frequency, high-capacity link from Bride’s Glen to Bray. In addition, and as the Minister mentioned, there are key employment areas such as Sandyford, Dundrum and Cherrywood. It is critical that we have an alternative to the car, that it is a reliable service and that the capacity is there to accommodate all of those people living and working in those areas. I ask the Minister to commit that, in the national development plan, we fast-track and reconsider that extension to the Luas line.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for his attendance earlier today and for the time he spent at the Covid committee along with members of NPHET yesterday. We had a frank and open discussion, including suggestions from members for how we might further engage with the public. As has been said in this session and in others, we are in uncharted waters. Nobody has the right answer. We are learning as we go. It is important to listen to suggestions and take them on board. We all need to work together. I also welcome this opportunity to discuss the Government's resilience and recovery plan, the Roadmap for Living with Covid-19. I note that the national framework is built on three pillars: healthy people, strong businesses and resilient communities. I will touch on those in the time I have. With the roadmap, there is a doubling of the public health workforce and the publication of the guidance on visits to long-term residential care. The doubling of the public health workforce is critical because we need more staff there. I welcome that the recruitment is under way. On the guidance on the long-term residential care, many if not all of us have had contact from constituents who have loved ones in nursing homes. They want an easing of restrictions so that they can visit them. I welcome that that is contained in the plan. It gives a clear roadmap for those families who wish to visit loved ones in residential care settings. I hope the Government will be able to develop an all-island response, both North and South. I know the acting CMO here in the Republic is in discussions with his counterpart in the North. That is a very important part of any future plan. Care and assistance in our communities, which is one of the three pillars in the roadmap, is critical. The local authorities are playing a crucial role in this. As I have mentioned in the Chamber previously, the local authority community calls represent an essential part of engaging with those who are isolating or cocooning. Volunteers in sports clubs and other groups have given their time to deliver groceries and medicines to people. I also commend the library service which is delivering audiobooks and engaging with those who cannot or do not want to leave their homes. I hope the Government will take this on board. As we work with this roadmap in the next six or nine months - it could be longer - we need to bear in mind outpatient appointments and screening services. Many people with other ailments may be nervous of going into a hospital or healthcare setting. It is very important to keep those services running as much as possible, irrespective of the level we are at. It is equally important that partners and husbands are permitted to attend maternity appointments. That issue needs to be dealt with. Earlier my colleagues spoke about sports. While training is taking place and it is very important for children, it is critical for mental health. The green ribbon campaign was launched today. The two of them are part and parcel. I hope there will be improvements to the Covid app. I suggested some improvements through the parliamentary question system and the Minister might take them on board.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sadly, it has been announced this evening that another four people have died of Covid-19. I offer my condolences to their families and to all those that have lost loved ones to Covid-19 here in Ireland. We have known this winter would be a significant challenge since the Covid-19 pandemic emerged here in March. The pandemic, combined with the flu season, will place enormous challenges on our health service and front-line workers. Pre-Covid, many of our hospitals were already operating at 90-95% capacity. I welcome today's announcement of the €600 million financial commitment made by the Government for this winter plan. In particular, I welcome the plan to provide 892 acute beds with 484 sub-acute beds. The extra capacity will be crucial this winter. The extra 500 isolation beds will provide reassurance that capacity exists if Covid cases continue to increase. At the heart of the strategy to combat Covid is the strong testing and tracing infrastructure. Extra funding to bring our public health teams to in excess of 3,000 professionals is welcome, as is the commitment to bring the capacity to more than 100,000 test per week. The flu vaccine will be issued to more than 1.5 million people over the coming weeks, starting with front-line workers, schoolchildren and vulnerable members of the community. I welcome innovative plans to allow pharmacists to inoculate people in their cars and other socially distant locations. I am sure all in the House are grateful for the flexibility pharmacists have shown. I welcome the additional 4.7 million home support hours. People with a disability and the elderly have made huge sacrifices during this pandemic. Many of them lost home care supports during the acute phase of the lockdown in April and May, and this support was gradually reintroduced. Supporting people at home and helping them avoid the need to attend a hospital is critical in this pandemic, particularly as we head into the winter months. The extra support for home help hours is welcome and necessary. Earlier today, we were informed that St. John of God, which provides crucial services not only to my own constituency in Dún Laoghaire but across south Dublin and indeed the rest of the country to more than 8,000 adults and children with disability and their families, would be withdrawing from its HSE contract. The announcement has caused great concern worry in the community, and many people have been in contact with my office today. Covid-19 has been exceptionally difficult for those families, and this is adding an additional stress and strain. I ask the Minister to intervene directly with the HSE. We must ensure continuity of service for this cohort. I hope the Minister can give us assurances this evening.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking this question. I would like to speak to the sibling-first policy and the impact it will have on many parents. This came as a surprise to parents and families, particularly those hoping that their children will go to the same primary school. I understand this change impacts on Catholic schools and does not impact on other school patron bodies. One particular family that has been in contact with me has a child already in fifth class and other children hoping to attend the same school. The sibling-first policy will have an impact not only on their family and quality of life but on areas of their life.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for that clarification. I understand that the policy primarily impacts on oversubscribed schools. That said, I think the sibling-first policy would impact negatively, particularly for the boards of management in terms of voluntary contributions for the schools and the issues facing principals as well in allocating places. While I appreciate the Minister's response and request that she forward it to me, I ask that further consideration be given to this issue in regard to schools in Dublin because it is going to be a surprise to parents come September 2021.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Budget 2021 has been published as our nation faces two unprecedented challenges, namely, the Covid-19 pandemic and a hard Brexit. The Government will spend an additional €17.3 billion in 2021, of which €8.5 billion will be allocated to Covid measures, while €3.4 billion will be spent supporting jobs and the economy as we deal with Brexit. A significant extra spend of €1.6 billion has been allocated to capital spending, which will provide 12,750 much-needed social homes and fund public transport improvements on bus, Luas and DART services. This is all done with no increases in income tax, PRSI or the USC and that is very welcome. The Government is following the right macroeconomic strategy: to borrow and invest in people and the economy. Members of the Opposition have called for what amounts to €28 billion in tax hikes to fund all sorts of populist policies. At a time when many businesses are on their knees, bringing in such tax hikes would simply destroy jobs and the economy. All Deputies would like to see more spending in particular areas, but there must be recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing Ireland at this time. I welcome measures to support the pandemic unemployment payment which has been extended into 2021, while allowing the self-employed who are on the PUP the flexibility to take up casual work. The increased tax relief for people working from home will assist thousands of workers. Young people have been particularly hard hit during the pandemic. The new €250 grant for full-time students will be of significant benefit to many. The addition of 5,000 new college places and the €1,500 increase in grants for postgraduate students will be of assistance. I welcome the investment in primary education, especially the reduction in the student-teacher ratio to 25:1. Funding is provided for 990 additional SNAs and 403 additional teaching posts which will support children with special educational needs. The State pension age will remain at 66, as per the programme for Government, while there will be increases in the living alone, qualified child and fuel allowance payments. The annual carer's support grant is to be increased by €150 to €1,850 
per annum. I welcome the retention of the Christmas bonus for nearly all those in receipt of social protection payments, including those on the PUP. The investment in the health service will see the delivery of 1,146 new acute hospital beds, 1,250 community support beds and 66 new ICU beds. Home help is to be increased by an additional 5 million hours, which will support our most vulnerable, particularly in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, where there is a high percentage of older people. For businesses, the new Covid restrictions support scheme will provide a grant of up to €5,000 per week if they have to close due to the pandemic. The commercial rates waiver will continue until the end of this year, while the VAT rate for the hospitality and tourism sector will be reduced from 13.5% to 9%. This budget invests more in public services and infrastructure than any other budget in the history of the State. It will protect lives and protect jobs. I welcome its announcement.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that more than 1,000 community and voluntary organisations have applied for funding under the Government's €35 million Covid-19 stability fund. Can the Minister provide an update on this very important scheme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for her answer. As she knows, community and voluntary sector organisations and social enterprises throughout the country have been hit very hard by the Covid-19 crisis. Nevertheless, many of them have been at the coalface of the response to the pandemic, whether through the Community Call or other initiatives. I acknowledge, as I am sure does everybody in the House, their efforts over the past nine months. The Government's Covid-19 stability fund has provided significant assistance, as the Minister said, to more than 560 organisations impacted by the pandemic. I acknowledge, in particular, the allocation of €2 million for disability services in Dublin, which was targeted at services for people most at risk. It is critically important that we help these organisations with their short-term cash flow and it is good to know that funding is being prioritised for that purpose. I understand that a total of €30 million was allocated in four tranches since June. Can the Minister provide more details on the additional allocation of €10 million? If she does not have the information to hand, she might pass it on to me later. The organisations we are talking about really need to know where they stand in order to make plans for 2021 and beyond.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for her clarification. It is very welcome, particularly in respect of the €5 million that was not spent. There were questions around that. The additional €10 million announced in budget 2021 is important to the organisations looking to access it. Their future is uncertain, particularly in the event of another wave of Covid infections and if a vaccine is not forthcoming. As I said, it is very important that we provide them with information as soon as we can in order to assist them as they plan for 2021.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for taking this question. On Brexit and the preparedness of small businesses, is he familiar with the research done by the customs clearance service, Declaron, a new partnership between the accountancy firm, BDO, and the fintech company, Fexco. According to their research, 37% of Irish businesses that trade with the UK have yet to start planning for Brexit. Businesses list their primary reason for not preparing as the fact that no trade agreement is in place yet. It is just 50 days until 2021 and such findings seem to me extremely worrying. Is the Minister of State surprised or alarmed by these findings?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. I note what he said about the 225,000 businesses that have been corresponded with, which is welcome, but the Declaron research also found that 54% of businesses that trade with the UK do not understand the new custom clearance procedures that are guaranteed to come into effect on 1 January 2021, which is worrying. Does the Minister of State agree with Carol Lynch, one of those who participated in that research, that many businesses seem to be sleepwalking into the trade agreement trap? Is he confident that businesses know that, even if the trade agreement is reached, there will still be a requirement for import and export declarations? Is there anything that can be done about this? Last month, a new online Enterprise Ireland Brexit readiness checker was launched to help businesses, which is welcome. What was the response to that? If the Minister of State does not have the answer this evening, perhaps he will furnish me with it because I would like to know how many businesses have logged on.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The €20 million fund the Minister of State referred to is welcome. However, my fear relates to those businesses that may not be aware of the full impact of Brexit or that, because of Covid, have not paid enough attention to it and have had other issues such as keeping the doors open on their minds. It is important that the Department and the Ministers responsible double down on making sure those businesses are aware. Some of these businesses have never dealt with customs issues if they have traded purely within the European Union. We need to get ahead of the issue. The Minister of State spoke about the €9,000 support for employees to be trained, which is welcome, but it is essential, with just 50 days left, that we prioritise this issue in order that businesses are well prepared in advance of a bad deal, which unfortunately seems likely in respect of Brexit.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking this question. Last year, passenger numbers rose in Dublin by 7.5%, going from 141 million passengers in 2018 to 151 million in 2019. I ask the Minister to provide an update on his plans to increase the bus fleet for 2021.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I said, passenger numbers increased by 7.5% in Dublin and 138 million journeys took place on Dublin Bus services in 2019. Dublin Bus has significantly increased efficiency, brought in new timetables and improved frequencies on the network, which has enabled it to continue growing its passenger numbers, hopefully into 2021. It is clear that there is a demand for improved and increased services across Dublin and Dubliners want to see more improvements on public transport. That is only right. If we want people to leave their cars at home, we are going to have to improve public transport services. I note what the Minister said about the BusConnects plans. That project is important and while the majority of it is welcome, some new routes will also benefit the network. On new proposed routes, I note that there was a discussion around 24-hour bus services. If the Minister has any information on that, particularly routes southbound from Dublin city to Bray, I ask him to elaborate on it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will the Minister of State provide an update on the engagement between officials in his Department and the OPW and relevant stakeholders on the Cherrywood strategic development zone, SDZ, particularly since January 2018? As he will be aware, I have raised this issue previously. It is very important not only to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire but to the State overall.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. I raised this issue in July. There was a changeover in the Minister of State's Department at the time. There has been a much clearer response this evening, which I welcome. My main concern is the overall development of the 360 ha SDZ, which is one of the largest in the State. The Minister of State referenced Tully church and the other nearby monuments. Because of the rich history and the artefacts in the area, chapter 8 of the SDZ plan is of paramount importance in the developer's work all around that site. It is important that the Minister of State's Department continues that good dialogue with the developer and with all stakeholders, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to safeguard those artefacts and ensure that when the development is complete they are protected as much as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. I want to put on record my appreciation for the work of the officials since July. I know that other meetings have taken place, more than likely virtually, but nonetheless there is good engagement on this site. The chairman of the OPW and others appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week. I thank them for their engagement. Given the historic nature of the Tully church and its surrounds, it is important that we get this right and that we afford those protections. Going forward, between now and when development is complete, the Minister of State might keep me informed of plans during and post-construction. If there is a site visit, I would be more than willing to participate.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Members for bringing this report to the House this evening for statements. It is too important to pass without such a discussion. I thank Deputy McNamara for his chairmanship of the committee. I thank all the committee members from across the House who contributed so much over the many meetings we held. I thank the witnesses for their insight, experience and expertise, which was invaluable in informing the committee and its report and in informing the public who watched intently the various discussions around Covid-19 and the challenges it presents. I thank the secretariat and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas for facilitating all of the meetings. I would say that the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response brought forward a pathway for this House to create the other committees of the House, such as the standing committees. It showed a way of facilitating those committees, even through level 5 restrictions like those in place today. I especially thank my party colleagues who served on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response from the start on 7 May. I thank the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly; the Minister of State, Deputy Butler; the Minister, Deputy Foley; and Deputy John McGuinness for their contributions to this 108-page report. It is important to remember that the committee met 67 times in public session over a 30-day period, receiving 275 submissions since 19 May. This allowed the Oireachtas to prepare for future committees to be facilitated by the House. It was an invaluable committee because it gave focus to the various issues and sectors impacted by Covid-19 at the time. Sadly, at the time of the report, we had lost 1,800 mainly older people to the virus. Thankfully, as a country, as a society and as a Government we have learned much more about this virus and how to live with it, and we have published a plan for living with Covid-19, about which we have spoken previously in this House. The attention paid to the testimony of witnesses at the time was quite moving. It captured the attention of the public and indeed the media. It was an outlet for people to ponder questions and considerations at the time of the first wave of the pandemic. Little did we know we would see ourselves back here so quickly at level 5, but it illustrates the pace and infectious nature of this virus and the need for us to take heed of that. The first of the 11 recommendations, which is correctly No. 1, relates to nursing homes. This was the single most discussed issue at the committee and is rightly noted as such in the report, especially since older people in this category accounted for 56% of all deaths from Covid-19 up to the time of the publication of the report. Since the committee ceased its work, I have put questions to the HSE on the resources being given, particularly around nursing homes. I am sure that resources and attention is being given to that cohort as we speak. The committee's recommendation that "a public inquiry be established to investigate and report on all circumstances relating to each individual death from Covid-19 in nursing homes" is being examined by the Joint Committee on Health at present. The committee's second recommendation covers the need to review "the impact of privatisation of Ireland's nursing homes". There will be many more challenges going forward but the issue of nursing home and residential care for the elderly and how that may arise in the future, pandemic or no pandemic, will involve many different Departments.Unlike then, but thankfully now, many hospital appointments and services continue to be offered. During the first wave, this was one of the main issues the committee discussed. I am very happy that, in the current wave, we have seen a total change regarding health services. This is not to say that everything is perfect, because there are problems. Community services, such as orthodontic services in my constituency, are affected by particularly long waiting lists. We need to address these if there are going to be further restrictions. I wish to highlight some of the other recommendations, including on testing and tracing and the report of the nursing homes expert panel. Recommendation 5 concerns the statutory sick pay scheme. In that regard, the social protection payments are assisting. Recommendation 6 relates to a regulatory review of the framework of HIQA and the Health and Safety Authority. That is an important element because, pandemic or no pandemic, we need to ensure both organisations are not crisscrossing each other, that they are fit for purpose and that they can implement any required changes to regulations or legislation. Recommendation 7 is about shared residential facilities, such as direct provision centres. This needs to be tackled, irrespective of a pandemic. Recommendations 8 to 11, inclusive, deal with many issues, such as meat-packing plants and, as my colleague Deputy McAuliffe referred to, the data relied upon by NPHET, which comprise an important aspect. Let me put in context where we are today. The initial report from the Department of Health on 11 March stated that there were 43 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with nine new cases on that day. Tonight, there are 429 confirmed cases and yesterday there were 379. We are now obviously on the right trajectory, as the Minister said, but it is important for all of us in this House and the general public to adhere to public health guidelines in order that we can drive these numbers down. I heard one of my colleagues say that the committee should have sat for longer but the body of work done was significant. It was a privilege for me, as a new Deputy, to have served on it. It is important that we all focus on the need to reduce the numbers, reduce our amount of social contact, take personal responsibility and adhere to the public health guidelines.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sadly, it was announced this evening that a further six people have passed away due to Covid-19, bringing the total loss of life to 2,028 people. Once again, I wish to offer my condolences to them and their families and loved ones throughout Ireland. Since the pandemic emerged here in March, we knew this winter would be a challenge. The pandemic combined with the winter flu season could have overwhelmed our health service. This was spoken about many times in the Chamber. Thankfully, that is not the case today. The public have made great sacrifices. Credit is due to the efforts of hospital staff, teachers, retail workers, transport workers and all front-line workers involved in Covid-19. They are helping to keep the trend downward. Ireland appears to be managing this second wave better than most of our EU counterparts. As we approach the end of level 5 restrictions, it is appropriate that Dáil Éireann considers the kind of Christmas we want for 2020. We were told that the objective of level 5 was to reduce the incidence of covid to a manageable level to allow us a meaningful Christmas. We all know and accept that this Christmas will be like no other. People have lost their loved ones and the threat of the virus still hangs over us. Yet, there is hope. Three vaccines have been announced. They will be distributed early in the new year. It is clear that the sacrifices made by the people during level 3 and level 5 have worked and are working. We must now move to allow some services to resume. Activities like sports are essential to support mental health and physical well-being. For many people, attending religious services is essential for spiritual well-being. Activities like meeting a friend for a coffee can be essential to emotional well-being. As we exit level 5 it is important that we relax restrictions on activities in a controlled manner. This should apply to gyms, churches, coffee shops, retail, restaurants and gastropubs. However, these businesses need certainty and the Government must confirm arrangements as soon as possible. As the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be aware, I have previously raised my concerns for the many business sectors, including hospitality, tourism, arts and retail. Businesses should reopen based on the size of the premises. That must be considered. We must balance the risk to the public and ensure that any reopening of the economy will be done against the backdrop of best public health advice.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking these questions. With just 35 days to go before the UK leaves the EU, what preparations have the Minister's Department done in advance of this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have no doubt this has been extremely time-consuming for the Minister and officials not just in his Department but across the Government for the past number of years. That said, it is prudent for us to have the reserve that budget 2021 has given us because of the potential of a no-deal Brexit. It is the right course of action. I know the Department is making every effort to deal with the challenges of Brexit but the next few months will be extremely difficult for Ireland and businesses, not just because of Brexit but because of Covid-19 as well. Is the Minister aware of this morning's report in The Irish Times, which claims that Ireland could lose out to France in laying claim to a significant portion of the €5 billion Brexit compensation fund? Even if we got all the fund, it would not compensate the hit to our economy. As the Department of Finance and ESRI analysis indicates, the long run impact to gross domestic product is between 2.6% and 5% in a no-deal Brexit, meaning losses of between €9 and €17 billion in 2017 prices. Will the Minister comment on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister and I welcome his remarks on the diplomatic approach. It is important that Ireland avails of this fund as much as possible, considering the grave impact Brexit could have on our economy. We must avail of that compensation fund as much as possible. The Minister made remarks on the work of the Revenue Commissioners and their engagement with businesses, which I very much welcome. We can see from experience with Covid-19 support schemes that many businesses are, unfortunately, not availing of existing supports. It is important we ensure these businesses are prepared for Brexit and that they also avail of supports that are available to them. Britain has provided six months for the implementation period in their economy, with a deferral of Brexit customs declarations until 30 June 2021. Would a similar adaptation period be considered by the Minister and his departmental officials here?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I acknowledge the level of support for businesses, which assists in keeping people in employment during the Covid crisis. It is unprecedented and extremely welcome. On the restart and restart plus grants, can the Minister provide information on both applications and decisions across Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Tánaiste for that. It is very encouraging to hear about the level of support, amounting to 118,600 applications, 1,646 restart plus grants and 1,191 restart grants. I pay tribute to Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council because it, like many other authorities, processed an unbelievable number of applications in a very short period. The grants have really gone to the core to assist businesses as they struggle through the pandemic. Regarding the supports to businesses outlined by the Tánaiste, maybe he will provide additional information on the number of applications by comparison with the number of approvals, and also information on issues that arose during the process.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would welcome those figures. I know that there is now discussion around the roll-out of vaccines, which is very welcome, but the impact of the pandemic is going to be with us for much of 2021. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, also acknowledged that while unemployment will remain at 15%, it may dip to 10% towards the end of 2021, which would be welcome. It is critical that we continue supports for businesses. In response to an earlier question, the Tánaiste mentioned that the new strategic tourism scheme would be launched in January, which is welcome. I ask the Tánaiste, through his offices, to consider including car rental firms in that scheme. There are about five key companies in the country which need support and have fallen outside of many of the existing schemes. It is essential that they are brought in under the umbrella of the tourism scheme or another one, if possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before I begin, I take this opportunity to wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other colleagues a happy new year. I also wish to thank the staff for their work and efforts during this pandemic to keep the Oireachtas operational. I welcome the opportunity to examine the impact the pandemic is having on the education sector. Like many colleagues, I have been contacted by students, parents and teachers over the past couple of weeks. Reopening schools last September was a great national achievement. I pay tribute to the teachers, SNAs, school principals, caretakers and all other stakeholders who helped reopen our schools and keep our children safe up until Christmas. Their efforts have ensured that schools are safe places, which was acknowledged in the NPHET letter to Government on 5 January, particularly in the context of the fact that 75% of schools had no engagement with public health authorities in the period up to Christmas. Given the recent surge in Covid-19 numbers and the advent of the B117 variant, however, the Government was right in moving to online learning for the month of January in order to limit the number of people moving around the country. Like all parents, I acknowledge the challenges that online learning presents. Despite the best efforts of teachers, online learning is no substitute for classroom time. Many children do not or cannot engage well in an online environment. It is difficult for pupils and parents alike. Online learning also results in fewer hours for students when compared with the in-class environment. The latest lockdown and the move to online learning has presented many challenges for parents of, in particular, younger children and those who are trying to juggle online learning and working from home. It is not easy for them, not to mention those homes with limited or no access to either ICT equipment or broadband. This has been an especially worrying time for sixth-year students. These students have been badly impacted.They lost a number of months in fifth year - three months of class time in 2020 - and will lose yet another month this year. Many of them have been in contact with me and they are all extremely anxious about the situation. Many want the opportunity to sit the traditional leaving certificate examination, but others prefer the option of predicted grades. I acknowledge the tremendous effort made by the Minister to allow them some classroom time this month. It is unfortunate that it could not proceed. We should do everything possible to support these students. I hope that by June the vaccine roll-out and the public health situation will be such that it will be possible to sit examinations, but the loss of classroom time must be considered. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of introducing the predicted grades option and to consult with students, parents and teachers in advance of making any early decisions on the matter. Students need to know as soon as possible. I welcome the news from the Minister, working with the education partners, about reopening the special schools and special primary classes from next Thursday. This will come as a great relief to the many parents who have been in contact with me. I thank the Minister, teachers, SNAs, principals and everyone involved for their efforts. While schools are safe, it should be recognised that staff with underlying conditions and those who care for elderly or vulnerable relatives at home have legitimate concerns about Covid-19. I hope local arrangements can be agreed to facilitate them. The vaccine must be rolled out to at-risk teachers and SNAs as soon as possible, and I ask the Minister to raise this with the Minister for Health.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Ministers for their attendance. I have questions for both of them. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the impact the pandemic has had on the higher education sector. As we have heard both in this session and in the earlier session, Covid has had a devastating impact on the education sector as a whole. Lectures and tutorials have gone online. Events and sports events have been cancelled and students and staff have had to work from home. I had a conversation recently with a group of third level students who were envious of the second level students in the latter half of 2020 because they were in school. This has had a great impact on the well-being of students and academic staff alike. That must be recognised. While restrictions are justified, I look forward to everyone being able to return to some degree of normality as soon as possible, as I am sure my colleagues do as well. In the meantime, the Government must continue to support students and the higher education sector. One positive initiative in budget 2021 was the Covid-19 once-off emergency grant for students. Could the Minister provide an update on the progress of the roll-out of that? SUSI has a key role to play in grants. I ask the Minister to take any necessary steps to ensure more flexibility is provided to that organisation. Concerns have been raised with Deputies about SUSI and Springboard over the summer. I tabled parliamentary questions to him in that regard. I hope that these issues are resolved and that the system will run smoothly from next September. Turning to the class of 2021, as I mentioned in the earlier session with the Minister for Education, this year's leaving certificate students have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. Not only did they miss three months in their fifth year, but they missed at least a month this year, owing to the restrictions. I hope the situation will be such that they can be offered the opportunity to sit the leaving certificate. However, some would prefer the option of predicted grades. The Minister has a key role in easing their anxiety in his comments and statements. Third level institutions could ease the pressure on Central Applications Office, CAO, points by producing more general entry programmes and increasing the places, where possible. I note the Minister's comments in that regard. This would take significant pressure off those students and I hope it can be considered. Could he give an update on those plans? I wish to ask about the capital programme for education and training boards, ETBs, and further education colleges. The Minister might come back to me with a written reply. Many of the colleges are in older buildings and they need investment. I would like to hear his thoughts on the matter. The Minister of State mentioned apprenticeships in his opening remarks. He has done fantastic work in that regard. The apprenticeship incentivisation scheme provides a €3,000 grant for employers. I understand 1,358 employers took up that offer, with 2,350 apprenticeships. He might send me the breakdown by sector of those figures.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the publication of the report into the mother and baby homes. Its publication brings to the surface the many dark and extremely oppressive, depressing and aggressive actions of many of these so-called homes. This report is an important document which gives voice to the experiences of some of the most vulnerable in our society across many decades. The survivors showed immense courage in giving their testimony. We know that almost 9,000 children died in the institutions under investigation, which was about 15% of all the children who were in the care of those institutions. This is a dark stain on the record of our State, the religious congregations and the society, which must be put right. The publication of this report is the first step in that process. It is an important one. We must ensure that the many recommendations from it are seen through. I welcome the Taoiseach’s unequivocal apology on behalf of the State. I also note the apologies issued by just some of the religious congregations to date. The apology is a key part of the 22 actions the Government is taking in response to the commission’s report. The Government has committed to a comprehensive response to the commission’s recommendations, rooted in a survivor-centred approach. This comprehensive response to the report is centred on eight themes, including a survivor-centred approach, the State apology and providing access to personal information. My colleague, Deputy Cathal Crowe, has already referred to the birth certificates. The rights of the women and their children to, and their need for, that information is crucial for health and personal reasons, as the Minister is aware. Other themes of the Government response include the archives, which we have discussed with many people over recent months, the databases, to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks, education and research, memorialisation, redress and providing a dignified burial for all the children who died in these institutions. I acknowledge the work and dedication of Catherine Corless and, equally, the five-year work of the commission, led by Judge Yvonne Murphy, supported Dr. William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly, in preparing this report. It is also important to acknowledge feedback from survivors. They have heartfelt and legitimate concerns about some aspects of this report that must be addressed, and soon. I would welcome a commitment from the commission to engage with survivors and survivor organisations in this regard. I ask that the Minister would clarify and confirm, perhaps in his closing remarks, that survivors who want a paper copy of the full report will be facilitated. For too long, these people have been left in the dark when it comes to information. It is their own information and it is imperative, as I said earlier, that the basic and simple action of access to the initial compilation of survivors' stories in this report and in the investigation must be made available to them. The report considers a number of institutions, some of which operated in my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, including the Magdalen laundry at St. Patrick’s refuge, Crofton Road, which operated until the 1960s when it became St. Michael’s Hospital and convalescent home, the Cottage Home on Tivoli Road, Racefield House on Lower Mounttown Road, Smyly's Home on the Monkstown Road, Bartres Children's Home in Kill O’ the Grange, known as the Grange Linden convalescent home, Blackrock and now part of an apartment complex, St. Joseph’s Orphanage on Tivoli Road, and the Bird’s Nest on York Road. Many of these buildings are familiar to the locals of Dún Laoghaire, but the history of what happened at many of these institutions may have been known only to survivors and their families. There are other homes and institutions that fell outside of this report and these must be examined too. No woman or child should be left out of any future investigation or redress. This report rightly puts the testimony and the stories of the survivors on the historical record. It is important that these testimonies are recorded for future generations. All religious congregations of all denominations and State institutions and organisations, both local and national, have a part to play in the reconciliation for these women and their children. The publication of this report is a first step on a very long road of national reflection, redress and reconciliation along with atonement for the wrongs and injustices committed against the most vulnerable and innocent in our society.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government's unprecedented supports for Irish businesses, jobs and enterprise in response to the devastating pandemic and an extension to the CRSS. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Government has rightly done everything possible to support businesses, jobs and workers. The CRSS allows business affected by Covid to claim support from the Revenue Commissioners of up to €5,000 per week. I understand that almost 20,000 businesses have availed of the scheme to date. Could the Minister provide details for Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown? He might forward them in time. The recent surge in Covid cases and the extension of level 5 restrictions will be of concern to many businesses. They are worried about the future. They are not worried about today or tomorrow but about the medium-term outlook for themselves and their employees. A vaccine is being rolled out and the programme relating to it has been well debated in this House. We will eventually return to a degree of normality. It would be helpful if the Government used the next six weeks to review the economic circumstances and prepare a national restart plan. A high-level advisory board should be considered to conduct a regional and sectoral review of the economy to pinpoint where the supports are required. Consultation with stakeholders is essential. A two-tier economic recovery must be avoided. From talking to businesses in my constituency, Dún Laoghaire, I am aware that some are doing well. They are mainly international exporters but many businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector and SMEs are struggling despite the unprecedented Government supports. We are aware that Irish SMEs provide the bulk of jobs in our economy. They are worried about the future and need to be reassured that supports will continue beyond 31 March until the pandemic ends and that there will be a plan to restart our economy. These businesses will need a considerable cash-flow injection to restart. For some the future is very bleak, unfortunately, and some, even with the supports, may not survive. These entrepreneurs need support to restructure their businesses or, in some cases, to wind up. Examinership and liquidation should be reviewed to allow fast-track, low-cost wind-ups and restructuring to allow entrepreneurs a fresh start. Local enterprise offices have made considerable efforts to advise businesses but businesspeople tell me that the system needs to be simplified, be it through a one-stop shop, a telephone line or a central website of some sort. More needs to be done for the orphan companies that fall between the existing schemes. I refer to those affected in the tourism, transport, car rental and entertainment sectors. The Minister will be aware that I previously raised the issue of Tom Duffy's Circus, an Irish institution in itself, and the generations involved in the arts, culture and heritage. Such businesses are being left behind and need support. I ask the Minister to redouble his efforts to support these companies and others.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for sharing time and for his statement. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the roll-out of our Covid-19 vaccination programme. I thank the Minister and his ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health for all their efforts during this global pandemic. Equally, I acknowledge the tragic deaths of 3,120 people and offer my deep condolences to all those who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. Like everyone in Ireland, I am extremely grateful for the efforts of our front-line healthcare staff who have worked tirelessly and diligently to keep people safe over the past year. Just yesterday, we saw 1,335 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed, 437 of which were here in Dublin. While this represents a considerable reduction on the peak of more than 8,000 cases three weeks ago, it is still very challenging and worrying for society as a whole. Almost 1,670 people are currently in hospital, with the HSE reporting that 217 are in ICU. While our seven-day average of cases has fallen from a high of 1,322 to 249 per 100,000 people it is clear that Covid-19 continues to pose a serious danger and threat to people. Sadly, more people will die but the public health message is very clear and straightforward: stay home and stay safe. There is light at the end of the tunnel and, as we heard from the Minister, there is hope. The vaccine programme is being rolled out widely.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct; the time is allocated by grouping. I was just saying that there is light at the end of the tunnel and there is hope with the vaccination programme well under way. As the Minister noted in his remarks, more than 143,000 vaccinations were administered up to last weekend, with another 51,000 due to be administered by this weekend. This will constitute the vast majority of nursing home residents and front-line healthcare staff. News that people over 70 years of age will start to receive their inoculations in the next two weeks is very encouraging. During the first wave, this cohort was particularly vulnerable and the worst impacted. Many such people have been cocooning or restricting their movements. News that the vaccination programme is well under way will come as a great relief to them. There is a great enthusiasm for the vaccinations. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I have been contacted by constituents looking for more information on the vaccine programme. People want to know when they are likely to be vaccinated and what the arrangements will be. The Minister has highlighted the arrangement made with GPs and pharmacists. This is very welcome. I am sure there will be further news in that regard. There is a real hunger for information among the public. Of course, all of this is subject to supply and, as the Minister highlighted in his remarks, there are issues in that regard at times and supply can fluctuate but people want a rough indication of when they will receive vaccination. I ask the Minister to ask the HSE about sending information to all homes or about a robust information campaign which might include a website and a helpline which people could ring to ask questions and get the information they desire about the vaccinations. I thank the Minister and his officials and all of the vaccination teams for the great work they are doing as part of this national effort.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to analyse and discuss the Government's housing policy, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a terrible impact on our society and economy, with more than 3,120 people dying and many more seriously ill. This has put huge pressure on our front-line healthcare workers. Rightly, the Government has moved to suppress the virus, a strategy that will continue as the vaccines are rolled out. While necessary, it is expected that the Covid restrictions will have an impact on overall housing supply in 2021. I welcome the fact that the Minister has kept social housing projects open and that regulations on other essential sites will be published later today. It is critical we continue building these badly needed homes and essential projects. Covid indicators are showing an improvement and hopefully it will be possible for the construction sector to restart when the situation is next reviewed.  Unlike many on the Opposition benches who offer no realistic solutions, the Minister has taken concrete steps to help families at risk of homelessness. New rental legislation introduced over the past six months provides greater protection for renters and families. The ban on evictions has been strengthened and extended and record funding has been provided to bring vacant homes back into use. The target is 1,189 in Dublin alone and 3,620 nationally. I welcome this and ask the Minister to ensure that this work continues into 2022. The results of all of this are clear. Homeless figures have fallen by 18.8% over the past year, meaning that over 2,000 families were supported out of homelessness. While the numbers of homeless people are still far too high, the progress to date should be acknowledged and must continue. Many Irish people want to own their own home and I welcome the supports given to first-time buyers, particularly through the help-to-buy scheme, which assisted 21,000 people to get on the property ladder. I would welcome other supports that provide affordable homes and also an expansion of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, we are seeing a phenomenal amount of housing construction, especially along the Luas green line corridor. The housing stock in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is projected to grow at almost four times the national average over the next ten years. The proposed LDA development of almost 600 social and affordable on lands in Shanganagh will provide much-needed housing locally. I ask the Minister to continue to liaise with his colleagues, particularly the Ministers for Transport and for Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure public transport and green infrastructure projects are developed in tandem with new housing developments.  I welcome the publication of the general scheme of the affordable housing Bill. There is great interest in an affordable housing scheme. Unfortunately some on the Opposition benches dismissed the Bill out of hand before they had even seen it but as they have always opposed affordable housing schemes, this is no great surprise. I look forward to examining the Bill in detail as it proceeds through the Oireachtas. I wish to acknowledge the work the Minister, his officials and local authority staff have done over the past year. As we begin to exit from the Covid restrictions in the coming months, I ask that a greater degree of urgency be attached to development.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The public transport system has played a vital role throughout this pandemic. I want to pay tribute to all front-line transport workers, who have really shown tremendous effort throughout.I wish to focus on the taxi industry in Dublin. I have raised this with the Minister before. Taxi drivers are front-line workers. They have been impacted severely by the pandemic. They are doing their best but are dealing with unhelpful speculation, particularly about whether they will continue to be able to use bus lanes. There are also other issues facing the industry. While I welcome the introduction of the PUP for those drivers under 65 years, many older drivers who had to cocoon for their own safety and that of family members have not been able to get back to work. They feel that they have not been provided with sufficient supports by this or the previous Government which is extremely disappointing. They have worked hard all their lives. They have been there for many of us over the years. What are we going to do for them now? What does the Minister propose to do for those drivers, particularly those over 65 years who might need to come out of the industry for any reason? Will he offer a scheme for that? Taxi drivers tell me they are concerned about the future of the industry. They have repeatedly raised the fact that almost two thirds of the taxi advisory council membership is vacant. I have raised this in a parliamentary question to the Minister. When will those posts be filled? Will the Minister engage with the stakeholders to agree a road map for the future of the sector? Will he consider convening a high level stakeholder group to prepare a plan for the future of aviation and connectivity? Ireland is an island nation and after Covid the airline industry will be crucial to the viability of Ireland's economy. The Minister may reply to me in writing if there is no time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss and examine the Bill to establish the Land Development Agency on a statutory basis, as the Minister outlined earlier. The Land Development Agency has one key priority which is to increase the supply of social, affordable and sustainable housing. The agency will utilise State lands to build social and affordable housing while creating sustainable communities. The agency is already working on nine sites across Ireland to develop 4,000 homes in co-operation with local authorities. Shanganagh in Shankill in my constituency is a perfect example of this where the Land Development Agency is working with the local authority there. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council approved a partial transfer of land on the site to the LDA. The Minister has now allocated €18 million and almost 600 units will be delivered with planning permission already in place. The development of that site is under way and we will see bricks and mortar very soon. That site will contain 200 social homes, 91 houses for affordable purchase, and 306 cost-rental units, which is to be welcomed. Based on what I have heard from constituents, they are eager to apply to the scheme. They have heard about affordable housing for many years but have never been able to apply. This unlocks that potential. It is beyond me as to how anybody in this House could suggest they would not support affordable housing after spending years of talking about affordable housing. These cost rental homes will provide an affordable option for people whose earnings are above the threshold for social housing support but who struggle to rent. As the Minister has outlined in his contribution, those people, whom we have all met, are trapped in the rental market. For years those in Opposition parties have spoken about affordable housing and other housing solutions to assist gardaí, retail workers and other workers, hard-working people who struggle to pay the existing rent for the houses they are in at the moment. This project will deliver for workers, not only in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire but throughout Ireland. The simple message from the people who attended meetings such as the one I hosted with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and councillors Justin Moylan and Michael Clarke is that they just want homes built. They want practical solutions and an end to the endless ideological debates about housing. The Land Development Agency Bill is good news for people who are currently renting. We need to provide a solution for those people. We gave a commitment that we would do that, and this Bill does just that. The Land Development Agency has long-term Government funding and access to State-owned lands and the industry experts to support such innovation. Ultimately, it is about providing affordable and social homes for rent and purchase. I welcome the Minister's clarification addressing genuine concern about the Bill. I call on all Deputies to support the legislation and help to end the housing crisis.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Ministers of State to the House, as well as the opportunity to discuss drug, alcohol and homeless services during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the first wave of the pandemic services for the most vulnerable people were severely impacted. The resumption of services for people with drug or alcohol dependency and the continuation of homeless services is to be very much welcomed. It must be noted that the impact of Covid-19 restrictions is not equal. People who are homeless or those living in overcrowded accommodation find it much more difficult to self-isolate or restrict their movements and interactions. This is compounded in cases where there is an addiction or alcohol or drug use. People often have complex health needs. People who are homeless are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 and are more likely to require emergency healthcare services during the winter months. I welcome the extra funding provided by the Government and the Department, along with the HSE winter plan, to support people who are homeless. In particular, the €4 million allocated by the Department to address the addiction and mental health needs of people who are homeless is very welcome. I understand this includes health supports for 218 new tenancies under the housing first programme and customised healthcare plans for 1,300 people living in single person accommodation. Some of the individual measures in Dublin are especially welcome. They include: the continuation of the seven-day dedicated homeless response team; the operation of a 110-bed isolation unit for homeless families and single people, supported by nursing, GP and social care services; health supports for 250 people cocooning while living in private versus accommodation; support for single people who are homeless, including an 18-bed unit for people with complex needs; and provision for mobile testing, tracing and self-isolation facilities for people who are homeless with suspected cases of Covid-19. I want to acknowledge the efforts of everyone in this area, in particular those on the front line, local authorities and organisations such as Inner City Helping Homeless which has continued to do fantastic work throughout the pandemic. In the medium term it is important to acknowledge the success of the housing first programme. I look forward to seeing these critical initiatives expanded in line with the commitments in the programme for Government.  Can the Minister of State confirm the number of residential treatment places available for people in need of addiction support? Are there plans to increase the number of beds? I ask for a response on that in writing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Tánaiste and the Ministers of State for their attendance and for the opportunity once again to discuss the business supports available during this pandemic. I have spoken before about the unprecedented supports given by Government, which have been warmly welcome and necessary for all those businesses. In particular, I mention the Covid restrictions support scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the waiver of commercial rates. The Tánaiste might outline further information about the Covid business aid scheme and when that information will be made available to businesses. There are outstanding issues with so-called orphan companies, which I have spoken about before, and the fact that they are falling between the cracks. I know the Government is examining this and I look forward to further updates on that. As the vaccine programme is being rolled out and ramped up and as hope is returning to many businesses, people are telling me that they are beginning to look to the future. That said, the Government should use the next few weeks to examine the economic outlook and prepare a national restart plan. The current Covid supports will keep many businesses going over the coming months as they have done in recent months but there will be challenges for the economy as it begins to reopen. We know it will not be one big bang of a reopen and that has been said before. It will happen on a gradual basis and hopefully over the summer months. Many businesses have significant restart costs and as the different sectors begin to reopen they will need an injection of working capital. I ask the Tánaiste to begin preparations in this regard. If possible, an indication should be given in the Government's revised living with Covid plan. Businesses will need tapered supports while they look to reopen. Again, this should be signalled where possible and as early as possible. Early announcements such as costs of commercial rates would be welcome. Despite every support for some businesses, the landscape has changed and many will not be able to return as normal. I welcome the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and the work he has done on the restructuring of businesses, which in some cases might have to examine an orderly wind-up, examinership or liquidation, and fast-track low-cost wind-ups or restructuring should be made easier, particularly after this pandemic. In the time I have remaining, I ask the Tánaiste to come back to me afterwards on the online trading voucher. It has been popular, particularly in Dublin, but many people have told me that the programme has either been oversubscribed or that there are delays getting onto it. I know that €20 million was given to that but I would like an update on the uptake for that over the four Dublin local authorities.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the implementation of the New Decade, New Approach agreement. This agreement was published in January 2020 in an effort to re-establish the Stormont Executive and to initiate a series of badly needed reforms to public administration in the North for the benefit of all its citizens. By and large, the comments and contributions by Deputies today have been cordial and positive and that is welcome. It should be noted that there are still outstanding commitments from the Stormont House Agreement and the Fresh Start Agreement. It is critical that the New Decade, New Approach agreement does not become like other half-implemented agreements. One significant aspect of this agreement is the increased funding that is promised. Big commitments were made last year and I understand just £1 billion of new money was delivered by the UK Government to it. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to keep up the pressure on his counterpart in London to deliver on those commitments. I welcome the establishment of the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach. The unit was allocated a €500 million budget for five years. This innovative shared island fund will ensure the Irish Government meets its commitments to the citizens of the North and of the wider Border region. As we enter the post-Brexit era, the shared island fund will see investment in the region in all-island initiatives such as research, health, education and the environment. This will enhance the all-island economy, society and improve North-South co-operation. I await further progress in areas such as infrastructure, energy and innovation. It should be noted the shared island fund goes beyond already agreed funding for the North-South bodies, such as: the reconciliation fund, cross-Border health arrangements, and the EU support for the region via the EU PEACE PLUS programme. Taken together, the commitment by the Government amounts to over €1 billion of funding out to 2025. The Taoiseach’s vision in this regard and his commitment to improving North-South relations need to be commended. The shared island fund is central to harnessing the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement, to deliver sustainable progress for all communities and ultimately to lay the groundwork for a more united island.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this opportunity to examine the Health (Amendment) Bill 2021, which provides for the establishment of mandatory quarantine for travellers arriving into the State in order to limit the spread of Covid-19. I thank the Ministers present and their ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Health and Justice for their efforts during this global pandemic. I equally acknowledge the untimely deaths of the 4,237 people who have succumbed to the virus in Ireland. Once again, I offer my deep condolences to all those who lost loved ones during this pandemic. Like everyone in Ireland, I am extremely grateful for the efforts of our front-line healthcare workers, who have worked so tirelessly and diligently to keep people safe over the past year. Thankfully the numbers of people hospitalised due to Covid-19 have reduced and other indicators are beginning to become more regular and normal, which is encouraging. However, we cannot let our guard down and it is right that we continue to suppress the virus during the month of March. This will ensure our GPs, nurses and medics can continue to roll out vaccinations without the pressure of dealing with a fourth wave of cases.  News this week that 82% of adults will be offered their first jab by the end of June is very encouraging. I also welcome the changes to the vaccine roll-out sequence to prioritise people with a high risk of complications from Covid, including people with serious underlying conditions. However, more must be done for carers in particular, as the Minister will know, and these people should be categorised as essential workers. I ask for that situation to be reviewed. The roll-out of vaccines with GPs has been going well but not surprisingly, there have been teething issues. Some people are being asked to travel excessive distances. In Dublin, people aged over 80 years old have been offered vaccinations in the Helix in Dublin City University, DCU. This is an excessive journey for some people. We must look at having more local hubs. I ask the Minister to examine both this issue and the reports of vaccinations not arriving at GP practices and appointments being cancelled at short notice.  While the vaccine is being distributed and Covid case numbers are low, we must make every effort to avoid importing new cases. This is where this new Bill comes in, as a proactive measure to introduce mandatory hotel quarantining to provide an extra level of protection against new variants entering from high-risk countries. The main aim of the Bill is to amend the Health Act 1947 to provide for mandatory quarantine in designated facilities for people travelling into the State, particularly from certain areas where there is significant transmission of Covid-19 or variants of concern. Rightly, the Act leaves the designation of high-risk category 2 countries to the Minister for Health, which will allow him flexibility to add new countries when necessary. The list has 20 countries and passengers who arrive from these countries are subject to stricter quarantine requirements and must complete 14 days of quarantine. I also welcome the three-month sunset clause, which will ensure this necessary but extremely strict law will only continue as long as is absolutely required.  I conclude by asking all Deputies in this House to be cautious about the language they use concerning international variants of Covid. Talk of people from Brazil, for example, who it should be noted are legally resident in Ireland, importing the P1 variant to meat plants and other places is regrettable. This kind of inflammatory, socially divisive rhetoric should be avoided. I thank the Minister for introducing this important legislation and I hope it will be supported by all Deputies.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this evening's discussion and debate on the difficulties facing the Irish banking sector. I acknowledge the Minister's contribution and the challenges faced by the banks in the market. More importantly tonight, our concern is about the employees and those who have lost their jobs. The news that Ulster Bank intends to exit the market after 160 years, as the Minister noted, is worrying not only for the banking sector but for the economy itself, as is the news of Bank of Ireland's decision to close 103 branches across Ireland.My thoughts are with the staff of those institutions as they face a very uncertain future, particularly at this time. Retail banking is going through a period of uncertainty and change, and the future will be challenging. However, there are some encouraging signs, particularly the NatWest announcement that it is in early discussions with PTSB on the retail network and has reached a memorandum of understanding with AIB on certain commercial loans. I call on the Minister to convene a high level task force of stakeholders to examine the future of banking in Ireland. As other colleagues mentioned previously, we need to look at what the future of banking will be in Ireland. How is it going to interact with retail customers in terms of providing a retail or high street banking service, and also with commercial businesses? We need to ensure that there is an offering that is both tangible and accessible. We must ensure that towns have access to retail banking facilities. This does not just affect rural Ireland; Dublin is also impacted by the latest decisions. We must ensure that SMEs have access to credit and lending facilities and that people have access to mortgage facilities. Credit unions and the An Post network have a vital role to play as intermediaries in the banking sector. I hope that Bank of Ireland proceeds with its proposal involving An Post but investment in IT, facilities and training will be required. I ask the Minister to encourage and ensure such investment is made because as the face of retail banking in Ireland changes, we must make sure that we keep up with modern advances. We must also ensure access to lending facilities for SMEs. This is something that the high level stakeholder group could examine. It is critical that we retain a banking sector that is diverse, modern and that serves customers and the Irish economy.  From the Minister's own discussions with the banks, is there a possibility of a new entrant, perhaps from Europe, to the Irish market? Obviously, I note the Minister's comments on Ulster Bank and the lack of profitability but it would be a great shame if we could not entice another operator into the Irish market.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss the plans to improve and reform further and higher education and the research and innovation sector. As we have seen during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ability to innovate and adapt to the challenges posed has been critical. These skills should be at the heart of the culture we foster in higher education. After Covid, the relevant sectors and institutions must be supported. Alongside our elderly, young people have suffered particularly badly during the pandemic. They have missed months of school and college. Apprenticeships and placements have been put on hold and those affected have lost critical time in their lives in which to build relationships and friendships. There are almost 415,000 people in the education and training sector, 27,000 of whom have a disability. They must all be supported as their courses and programmes resume. Where possible, clarity needs to be provided on arrangements, further focused financial supports need to be introduced, and mental health and well-being programmes need to be enhanced. This year's and next year's first-year students have been particularly impacted.  Student unions, sports campuses and college authorities should be provided with additional funding to provide refresher weeks to help develop and strengthen networks on campus when students return. What are the Minister's long-term plans for a capital programme? When does he expect we will see the access plan for higher education and the review of the student grant scheme? Will the Minister confirm what arrangements are being put in place for further education colleges? They are due to have practical Quality and Qualifications Ireland coursework completed by May. Will this deadline be pushed back? Will the Minister engage with further education and training boards and principals to offer them clarity on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State and thank them for their time and for taking questions this morning. The general indicators seem to be going well. The Minister and Minister of State outlined some of the indicators in terms of vaccinations. I note that the numbers in respect of one of the cohorts, that of front-line hospital staff, have gone from 16% to 4%, which is extremely welcome. Case numbers and hospitalisations are going in the right direction, which highlights that vaccination and restrictions are working. I welcome the fact that NPHET is expected to announce its recommendations on nursing homes later today. It is commendable that 72,000 of those over 85 have already been vaccinated. I think the Minister of State highlighted a figure of 99% in that regard. I ask the Minister of State to outline the process for those who are housebound. She may have stated that the National Ambulance Service is carrying out that work. I ask her to outline the position in that regard a little further. I share the Minister's frustration regarding the supply of vaccines. I am sure that many of his European counterparts share that same concern, as do members of the public. All Deputies are being contacted by people who are frustrated by the lack of supply and the figures that are presented but then have to be scaled down simply because of issues relating to manufacturing supply. I note that vaccinations of a cohort comprising those who are high risk and aged between 16 and 69 will begin this week. How many people fall into that category? When are certain categories of workers going to know into which cohort they actually fall? As previous speakers stated, such workers include members of An Garda Síochána, special needs assistants and public-facing workers such as those who work in GP surgeries, pharmacies or shops, for example. Carers have also been mentioned. The Minister and I have spoken about this issue previously. On the issue of mass vaccination centres, can NIAC examine the usage of sub-centres such as parish centres or community halls as has been done in Israel and the United Arab Emirates? Using such premises has been very effective in those countries and has brought the vaccination programme right into the heart of communities. GPs and pharmacists would play a key role in that regard. Finally, I have received reports in respect of essential retailers that are bringing in non-essential items to sell in their shops. I refer to Dunnes Stores in particular and its shop in Cornelscourt in my constituency. There have been reports regarding retailers in counties Clare and Limerick. Non-essential retailers find this extremely disturbing because they just cannot compete. There does not seem to be any problem for the retailers that continue to engage in such practices. It does have an impact. If people are not all in this together, as the phrase goes, then it is not fair. I ask the Minister to please follow up on that issue.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister very much for being here to listen to the discussion on this very important Bill, the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2021. This legislation will help every child to get the best possible start in life, allowing parents to spend more time with their children during the first year of their life. This Bill seeks to amend the Parent’s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to increase the duration of parent's leave during which benefit is paid from two to five weeks. Each parent will be given an additional three weeks of paid leave and the period in which this can be taken will be extended to the first two years following the child's birth or adoptive placement. This legislation will also apply in respect of children born since 1 November 2019. Parent's leave benefit is paid at the rate of €245 per week. It is expected that this investment in parental support for children will cost €28.6 million this year and €22 million a year thereafter, supporting up to 39,000 parents. As the Minister will be well aware, the Covid-19 pandemic has proven particularly difficult for parents over the past 18 months. I encourage all Deputies in the House to support this Bill.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome today's debate on the Residential Tenancies Bill. This short, two-page Bill amends the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 to extend the application of its enhanced tenancy protections for a further three months from 13 April 2021 to 12 July 2021. This extension is necessary due to the ongoing impact and threat of the third wave of Covid-19 and is a proportionate response that balances constitutional property rights with the common good. The Bill also provides for technical amendments to enhance the interoperability of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act with the Residential Tenancies Act 2020. Clarification is also provided that the 5 km travel restriction does not affect the legal obligation on a tenant to pay rent. This is the fourth Bill that has been brought forward by this Government since it took office last summer to safeguard tenants during this pandemic. Like many Deputies, I have also been contacted by tenants seeking further protections and reforms of the rental sector in line with our programme for Government commitments.I look forward to working with the Minister to achieve these important changes. I hope this short Bill, which is necessary to ensure Covid protections are extended until July, is supported by all Deputies.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister and Minister of State and am grateful for the opportunity to examine the Covid-19 vaccine roll out. At the outset I want to place on record my own appreciation to the doctors, nurses, members of the Defence Forces, vaccinators and others involved in the critical effort to bring our nation out of this pandemic. News that more than 1.25 million vaccines have been administered is extremely welcome. We have seen the positive impact of the vaccination programme on our nursing homes and hospitals and internationally in countries like Israel, the UK and the USA. The vaccination programme combined with other public health measures will bring us out of this dreadful pandemic and allows us to return to normality during the summer. The programme has generally been successful but there are challenges. Like other Deputies, I have also been contacted by people over 70 who are housebound. The National Ambulance Service has done a fantastic job in administering vaccines to approximately 1,700 people in their own homes but I understand that around 300 people are still awaiting their first jab. It is critical that good communication is maintained with those people and their families so they can be reassured that they have not been left behind. Many people in the high risk and very high risk categories have also been in touch with me. Some GPs are not dealing with this cohort at all and in such cases, arrangements should be made for them to register with their local HSE area office. Finally, I understand that a number of genuine, front-line workers in category 2(g), who were registered through the portal may have been left behind. I hope that is not the case but will forward the details to the Minister's office.  Will the Minister investigate the possibility of including other vaccines approved by the EMA, the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the list of accepted vaccines for people entering Ireland?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to acknowledge the unprecedented support the Government has provided to support businesses and maintain jobs throughout this pandemic. I welcome the Minister’s commitment that there will be no cliff edge to these supports and that Government support for businesses and jobs will continue well into the year. As he will be aware, some industries will need additional support to restart as Ireland fully reopens. I recently held an online meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, mainly focused on the hospitality sector in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The message from that sector was straightforward; they welcomed the supports given to businesses by Government during the pandemic but they also called for certainty around the timeline for reopening and asked for key supports such as the reduced VAT rate and the commercial rates waiver to be continued until they get back on their feet. Larger hospitality businesses in particular, such as hotels, need adequate notice to prepare their premises, buy stock and rehire staff. They have also asked for flexibility with supports such as the PUP so that staff can return on a phased basis. I ask that the Minister has regard to these points as the Government finalises plans to reopen the economy. On the credit guarantee scheme, I understand €2 billion has been made available to Irish businesses. Can the Minister advise the level of uptake of this scheme? Can he also provide an update on the uptake of the enterprise support grant scheme, which provides a once-off grant of €1,000 to self-employed people? I join other Deputies in urging him to work with colleagues to introduce fast-track business insolvency arrangements to support entrepreneurs who need to wind up businesses that are no longer viable and allow them a fresh start. As we have seen with other downturns, both here and abroad, supporting efficient structural adjustment of non-performing sectors ultimately aids entrepreneurs and the wider economy to rebound.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I join colleagues in congratulating the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her husband, Paul, on the birth this morning of their baby son. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to the House and thank her for her contribution. As we are all aware, Covid-19 has had a huge impact on our country, adding significant pressure to the nation's mental heath services. I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive update on service provision and, indeed, her dedication since she took office, particularly in respect of nursing homes in my constituency. Fortunately, we can see that the vaccination programme in nursing homes has been successful and the incidence of Covid in those facilities has been all but eliminated. However, it is worrying that we have seen a significant increase in eating disorder referrals over the past year. Four out of five young people accessing those services are young women. I particularly welcome the Minister of State's indication that there will be an increase in capacity for people with eating disorders. Equally, I welcome the investment in telehealth services and online services such as the national crisis text line and the support for NGOs that assist people directly. Organisations like SpunOut and Jigsaw have developed fantastic campaigns aimed at younger people, which is very welcome. As we exit the pandemic, it is critical that supports for people facing personal mental health challenges, whether relating to addiction or other issues, are available. In regard to senior citizens, I welcome the Minister of State's comments on day care centres. I am involved in a day care centre in Dún Laoghaire and it is really reassuring to know there are plans afoot to open it and other centres. I commend her on her commitment to increase services and look forward to engaging with her as they reopen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for agreeing to share his time. I welcome today’s debate to discuss the opportunity of examining housing and the rental crisis impacting people right across the country. Like all Deputies, I am fully aware of the difficulties facing people trying to rent or buy a home and obviously the cost of rents is a huge issue. We are all contacted by people who are either falling behind on the rent or struggling to rent or having difficulty even finding a property to rent. In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire average rents on a two-bedroom apartment are close to some of the highest in the country. However, thankfully, as the Minister has alluded to, we have 600 affordable homes being developed in Shanganagh in my constituency along with cost-rental units and a further 50 cost-rental units being developed as we speak on Enniskerry Road. However, the rent levels are unacceptable and the Government has acknowledged this by bringing forward a suite of measures to increase the supply of homes which will drive down rents. We have seen that accidental landlords are exiting the market for various reasons and it is not a welcoming place for them. We must increase supply, not only supply for people to buy, not only supply for people to rent but we need people in the private market as well. These should be individuals rather than the large investors. Rent freezes are not a sustainable long-term solution.I saw that in the Sinn Féin Private Members' motion, that it is some sort of panacea. That is not going to be enough. As the Minister said, we have seen that overturned in cities like Berlin. The impact on the supply has unintended consequences and I ask Sinn Féin to reconsider that. Ireland needs at least 35,000 housing units per year to meet demographic demand. Ultimately supply is at the heart of the solution to the problem. This is why the Government allocated a record amount of funds to develop social and affordable housing. On affordable housing alone, the Government has arranged more than €135 million in direct funding and State-backed borrowing to the approved housing bodies, AHBs, to develop the supply of affordable housing.  This Government is in office ten months and has already brought forward a record number of housing and rent Bills, including the protections referred to by the Minister, and unprecedented legislation protecting renters during this Covid-19 pandemic.  More needs to be done, including further protections and reforms on taxation of institutional investors, and the Minister spoke about that yesterday when speaking about the Bill he brought before the Cabinet. This must be introduced via legislation, not motions in the House. It is simple rhetoric for Sinn Fein to come in here and say that it has a solution when in fact it voted against the practical measures this Government has attempted to bring in. We ask for its support. All Deputies in this House want to deal with the housing crisis. We are all contacted by people every day who are in difficult situations. It is imperative that all Deputies across the House work with the Minister to solve the housing crisis. There are tangible solutions on the table that are unprecedented, as the Minister said, and I ask all Deputies in this House to support our countermotion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There has been a large and worrying number of high-profile assaults on members of the public, particularly on public transport and in public spaces. Unfortunately, some have been posted on social media. Recently, a lady was effectively pushed under a DART train in Howth. Sadly, many of these incidents go unreported and they are devastating for the victims. I was recently told of an incident in a local park when an Asian family was surrounded by a group of youths and subjected to racial abuse. None of these crimes should be happening. They are devastating for the victims. When will Garda recruitment resume? Can the Taoiseach provide an update for the House on the programme for Government commitments to tackle such anti-social behaviour and crime in cities?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am very pleased to participate in the debate. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action and we have had a lot of discussion on this matter. It has been quite amicable among Members across the Houses, which is to be welcomed. This Government committed to bringing this Bill forward in a relatively short period, which is being done. The Bill sets out the legal framework for Ireland’s transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich, environmentally sustainable and climate-neutral economy by no later than 2050. It provides for a 2030 interim target, five-yearly carbon budgets, sectoral emissions ceilings, an annually updated climate action plan and a long-term climate action strategy. As the Minister of State will be aware, the local authority is going to take the lead on the climate action plan in our shared constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. It is important that elected members of the local authority and other elected members, irrespective of level, feed into that plan because at the end of the day, while the Government can guide this plan, ultimately its implementation lies with local authorities. It is crucial that they play their part in that.  The legislation also places on a statutory basis the commitment to achieve a climate-neutral economy no later than 2050, which will be known as the national climate objective. Of course, this does not mean that Ireland will cease to produce carbon emissions by this time; it means we are committing to offsetting all the carbon we produce by 2050. A large part of this will involve reducing emissions by changing practices in sectors such as energy, housing, transport and agriculture and by sequestering carbon through methods such as rewilding parts of our country. The Bill will ensure Ireland meets its international commitments under the Paris Agreement. Working internationally with almost 200 other countries including the US, China and India, the agreement aims to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2°C, while pursuing means to limit the increase further to 1.5°C. Over the next decade we will see revolutionary change when it comes to green infrastructure and technology. We are seeing this in the UK, which is embracing green tech and leading the way. Global capital and investors are following suit by abandoning old carbon intensive sectors and earmarking funds for green tech development. We can see that here in Ireland too. Ireland cannot be left behind and the Bill will ensure our country is at the forefront of this green revolution. These changes will be challenging. We heard from Deputies earlier about the concerns within various sectors and this will require fundamental change in many parts of Irish life. We have to accept that, though at times it will be difficult for all of us. In rising to the challenge, we will be able to improve the health, welfare and security of our country. I have raised my concerns about energy security for Ireland with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications previously and have submitted a parliamentary question on that matter. While we must rule out certain types of energy, it is imperative that we satisfy ourselves that we have energy security for the next decade and beyond. It is not just for our generation but for the next generation and those beyond them that the Bill must deliver the changes we want it to. Once the legislation passes, we will then prepare the climate action plans which will set out the actions that must be taken to ensure we deliver on our commitments to reduce total carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This will make Ireland a world leader in responding to climate change and improve our country and our living environment immensely. The next step is to prepare the new climate action plan, which will set out the actions that must be taken to ensure we deliver on the commitments in the programme for Government, including making sure we achieve our 2030 targets and neutrality by 2050. This would make Ireland the world leader to which I referred.  The legislation underwent significant and intense scrutiny at the Joint Committee on Climate Action. I was proud to be a part of that committee and I pay tribute to our Chair, Deputy Brian Leddin, for his steering of the committee and for improving the draft text as the committee worked over the past number of months to do so. I welcome the fact that the Minister has included the majority of the 78 recommendations proposed by the committee, which will significantly strengthen the Bill. Language has been amended to ensure obligations are clearly stated, and the relationship between the various mechanisms is also more explicit. In line with the programme for Government commitment, the Bill stipulates that carbon budgets should provide for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Key principles such as just transition, climate justice and protection and restoration of biodiversity are matters to which the Minister and Government will have regard when preparing the various action plans. Importantly, public participation provisions have been strengthened, with the Bill providing that for each of the relevant plans, strategies, and carbon budgets the Minister will consult with the public so they can have their say. A public consultation is currently under way, which closes on 18 May. It is very important that at this time, before this Bill is enacted, the public have their say in how those action plans are shaped and what is contained in them.  As I mentioned, the next phase will be to develop a climate action plan. In housing, we must move quickly to retrofit homes. A commitment has been made to retrofit 400,000 homes. The Minister of State knows that the local authority in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown also made a commitment and made great strides in improving local authority housing stock, and retrofitted quite a number of them. There is more to be done in just transition and retrofitting. There are private homeowners who cannot afford to retrofit and that is why it is key that we bring them along with us and that homes are made warmer and more secure. Retrofitting is an important part of that. It will save energy, reduce energy bills and make homes more comfortable for the owners and inhabitants. Pilot schemes such as those provided by EnergyCloud provide innovative technological solutions to reducing the instance of fuel poverty and ensure we use wind energy to its full potential. I raised this at the committee last week. We must also ensure that all new housing stock is fit for purpose and we need regulations to ensure the reuse of grey water to reduce pressure on our national water network and conserve our precious drinking water. On transport, we need to invest in our public transport network. Major infrastructural projects such as the DART underground and the upgrading of the Luas green line are critical. Equally, we need investment in walking and cycling infrastructure, where there must be a renewed focus by local authorities to complete projects such as the Sutton to Sandycove cycle track and ensure that it is a coastal route. That route has been planned for approximately 30 years and I fear we are moving away from the original coastal plan and proposing an on-road solution. It is imperative that the majority of that route be coastal. The funding is in place now and we have to ensure, collectively as a Government with the Deputies of this House, that this is achieved, as well as the Lee to Sea coastal routes. The shift to electric cars must be supported with practical measures, such as more on-street charging points. The Minister of State will be aware our development plan specifies that all new developments would have charging points. It is important that is replicated throughout the country in the current drafting of other local development plans. On land, we must ensure we continue to develop our forestry programme and I welcome the Government's commitments to plant native forestry and to enhance and support biodiversity. It is the energy sector in which Ireland has the most potential to make significant progress. We are well placed to become a world leader in offshore energy generation. This must be supported by an upgrade to the national grid and the completion of the international interconnectors. This is again something I raised with the Minister before, and it is important we stay on course with it. While these changes will be challenging, I have no doubt they will improve our environment. Ten years from now, it is to be hoped we will be living in a healthier and cleaner Ireland as well as in cleaner cities. Biodiversity will have been improved and we will be on track to meet our international commitments and, more importantly, our moral commitments to the next generation of Irish and global citizens. I support the Bill on that basis. It is important that we, collectively here in the House, and notwithstanding further amendments, ultimately see unanimous support for such a measure. I spoke earlier about retrofitting 500,000 homes and installing 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next ten years. Ambitions like that are crucial, not just in respect of retrofitting but across the board. When people see the tangible benefits of this ambitious and brave programme, I think and I hope they will buy into it. Ultimately, however, they will be the beneficiaries of it. This crisis is happening now and we cannot afford not to do this. To those who deny there is any need for climate action, I say we should all strive to reduce our carbon emissions, irrespective of our views. This plan will meet with that ambition. The targets are ambitious but we must start now. The sooner this Bill is passed, the better we will be. I commend the Bill. I thank the Minister of State for his time and I ask him to relay some of the comments I made to the Minister because I am waiting to hear a response.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is just me. Tonight's figures remind us of the need for vigilance, with 393 new cases and, sadly, eight further deaths. I acknowledge the great efforts by everybody involved in this national effort, especially our front-line healthcare workers. The vaccination programme is certainly picking up pace. It is encouraging to see 1.7 million vaccinations have been administered, with almost 1.2 million people or 30% of adults over the age of 16, having received their first dose. I also express my appreciation to the Ministers present for their availability and assistance in matters in the constituency in Dún Laoghaire. News that people who have had their first AstraZeneca jab can be considered vaccinated after four weeks is particularly welcome and good. I ask that the Minister for Health considers getting that message out there as much as possible, because it would reassure many people who have been cocooning. Many of them believe they have to wait for the 12-week period and they do not want to stop restricting their movements or cocooning. It is important that message gets out there. On the mandatory hotel quarantining, the Minister will be aware of several recent cases in which people needed to travel abroad for medical treatment. I ask that a streamlined process be put in place for those vulnerable individuals. I know the Minister is working on issues, and perhaps he might update us in his response. I have some questions, especially on the Janssen vaccine. It is particularly useful for administration by pharmacists. When will the first significant shipment of Janssen vaccine arrive and when will the pharmacists begin vaccinating? In terms of vaccinations, will other organisations such as the Tropical Medical Bureau be involved or considered in the roll-out?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister for Health might come back to me on whether the pharmacists will begin from next week in their vaccination programme and whether other agencies such as the Tropical Medical Bureau will be involved or considered. A number of special needs assistants, SNAs, teachers and carers have been in contact with me. They accept the new age-based vaccination roll-out but wonder if arrangements could be put in place to allow people to register online for last-minute vaccinations. If there are excess vaccines in a local vaccination centre or through a GP, could they be considered? The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is probably aware I am involved in a day care centre in Glasthule. Throughout Dún Laoghaire and the country, there is real eagerness for that cohort to go back to the day care centre setting of enjoyment, fun and interaction with others. Does the Minister of State have any update on when we might see them return? Obviously, that age cohort has been vaccinated, by and large, as have the staff who work in those day care centres.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Ministers of State for those updates. The news about the day care centres is particularly welcome. Many people and staff do not know when they will be reopening so it will be great to get that information as soon as that subcommittee reports. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, for that update. No doubt it is very welcome that cohort is being vaccinated. There was a slight delay in starting that programme for the most vulnerable and it is important it continues. I ask the Minister to come back to me on the question of pharmacists. I just want to get clarity on this matter. I know the vaccines are coming in next week, but when will the vaccinations in pharmacies start? Many pharmacists have completed the documentation that was required and sent it back to the HSE. Not all pharmacies are suitable as vaccination centres due to their size, but if we could get a bit more information I would be very grateful.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Private Security Services (Amendment) Bill 2021. Like Deputy Howlin, I remember the implications in 2004 when the Private Security Services Act was brought in to regulate that industry, because it was seen as unregulated. There were implications then, obviously, for various service operators which were welcome. This amending legislation is also welcome. In time, further amendments may be required. It is important to note how, in a relatively short period, amending legislation such as this has come before the House. I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this important legislation which amends and repeals certain provisions of the Private Security Services Act 2004 and the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926. The Bill will bring those who assist in the enforcement of court orders for evictions and repossessions under the regulation of the Private Security Authority. Currently, private security firms engaged in the enforcement of court orders, including the repossession of properties, do not fall under a category for licensing through the Private Security Authority. This omission has clear implications for the oversight and regulation of private security firms that may be involved in repossessions. There have been a number of high-profile and contentious evictions in recent years in which private security firms have taken part. These include the events at both Strokestown and North Frederick Street in 2018. Both events led to violent incidents, unfortunately. There were clashes with gardaí in North Frederick Street, while a number of people were attacked following the eviction which took place in Strokestown. In light of the demonstrable danger which may arise in the execution of court orders for those within a property, and indeed for operatives of private security firms, it is clear there must be accountability and regulation in this area. It is essential that those providing security services should operate to the highest standards. The Bill's main provision is the insertion of an additional category and a definition of "enforcement guard" in the list of security services covered by the Private Security Services Act 2004. This will require enforcement guards to obtain a licence to operate, as well as ensuring they are subject to the training standards and licensing regime operated by the authority. With the introduction of these amendments, the Private Security Authority can continue to provide its important role in the private security industry, as well as the contribution it makes to the protection of our community. The Bill also makes several additional amendments including allowing the authority to refuse to renew a licence or suspend or revoke a licence of a body corporate because of the actions of its members. That is an important provision because it was missing all along. It makes the register of licensed persons available for inspection free of charge to members of the public. It introduces a new offence of impersonating an inspector of the authority. Many of us will recall the removal of persons occupying a private property on North Frederick Street in September 2018 on foot of a High Court order, which found they were unlawfully occupying the property. The persons were removed by a private security firm. Currently, personnel involved in the enforcement of court orders are not subject to regulation on the basis that this activity does not fall within the definition of what constitutes a security service under the Private Security Services Act 2004. In light of the widespread public outrage at the events at the property on North Frederick Street, along with the inherent risks associated with unregulated persons carrying out such functions, the then Minister for Justice and Equality made a commitment to the Dáil in September 2018 that the law would be amended.The matter was considered by an interdepartmental working group which recommended bringing such personnel within the licensing remit of the PSA. Enhanced regulation of the sector was also called for by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in 2018. Ultimately, private security staff occupy a position of trust, engaging in regular interactions with members of the public. Those providing security services must, therefore, operate to the highest standards. This Bill will help to ensure that objective is realised and I call on all Deputies to support the measure.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Bill 2021. I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, for bringing the Bill before the House. The Bill introduces the legislative basis to implement the Brexit impact loan scheme. Once launched, this scheme will be open to SMEs, specifically small and mid-sized companies which have up to 499 employees. Particularly welcome is the extension of the scheme to businesses engaged in the farming and fishing sectors. I welcome the scope of the proposed arrangements, with flexible loans ranging from €25,000 to €1.5 million to be made available to eligible businesses. The flexible terms of between one and six years, discounted interest rates and loans of up to €500,000 to be made available on an unsecured basis will be particularly welcome. The scheme will provide an 80% guarantee to participating lenders on loans to Brexit-impacted businesses and will be underpinned by a counter guarantee through the European Commission’s pan-European guarantee fund, which is managed by the European Investment Bank. The new scheme, which will be administered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, will make up to €330 million in lending available to help businesses to continue to respond to Brexit. In many respects, the Covid pandemic has masked the true impact of Brexit in Ireland. As the uncertainty around the pandemic ends, businesses will continue to need help to deal with the consequences of Brexit, particularly when Britain brings in border or customs controls later this year. Access to finance for these businesses is critical, particularly for those businesses impacted by Brexit. This scheme will deliver important supports for the fishing, farming and food sectors and for businesses generally as we seek to ensure their ongoing viability. I welcome this Bill and I ask all Deputies to support it. It is important that in the roll-out of the fund, a system will be put in place for businesses that have been trading for a number of years and are not just new entities applying for the supports. It is important that where a fund exists, it is targeted at such well established businesses and those that are particularly hard hit by Brexit or other factors. I mentioned the North and potential customs controls coming in. These businesses will require support. The previous contributor spoke from the perspective of the Border region. It is important that businesses in that region are given supports because, arguably, both the fishing and other sectors will be hit hardest.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the report of the Ballymurphy inquest. I acknowledge the perseverance and dedication of the families of the victims in their long journey to establish the facts of what happened and to get justice. I extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of those victims killed between 9 and 11 August 1971. It is unacceptable that these families had to wait almost 50 years for the truth. One wonders if these killings had taken place in England, Scotland or Wales, whether successive British governments have acted sooner. This was a shameful episode. Innocent people were killed and their reputations were sullied. It was appalling and it must be acknowledged by the British state. I welcome the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, to underline the seriousness of the findings and to call for a meaningful apology to be extended to the families. The Taoiseach was right to highlight the need for transparency and truth on the atrocities that happened during the Troubles, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which took place 47 years ago yesterday. Thirty-four people died in the bombings and more than 300 were injured when four car bombs were detonated on 17 May 1974. Their families and friends deserve the truth, as do all victims of atrocities that took place during the Troubles. There must be a re-engagement by all parties to the Troubles to discover and tell the truth. The victims and their families must be the priority.  With the shared-island initiative, it is important for all of us to re-engage in cross-Border initiatives to ensure there is reconciliation on all sides. Obviously, as we have seen with Ballymurphy, it is important for victims to have the truth told. The names of innocent victims must be cleared of any wrongdoing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister's statement earlier on the ongoing attacks and crisis in the Middle East. In particular, I welcome the announcement of additional humanitarian funding from the Irish Government. The latest escalation in Israel and Palestine has been deplorable. Reports that more than 200 Palestinians, including 62 children, and nine Israelis, including two children, have been killed are shocking. I support calls for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire. A reported 1,600 rockets have been fired as part of a barrage against Tel Aviv and southern Israel. These indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas are completely unacceptable and must stop. The targeting of residential areas in the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Defense Forces, IDF, has been disproportionate and has resulted in a significant loss of life and has injured thousands. This is unacceptable and must stop. Equally, demonstrations across the West Bank and Israel, which have resulted in the loss of life and destruction of property and livelihoods, are completely unacceptable. We have seen the targeting of media outlets and media buildings in those attacks. Authorities must do more to keep order and protect civilians. Irish people have been rightly appalled by the rapid escalation of violence, which undermines the peace process and, ultimately, the shared objective of a two-state solution. I join with other Deputies in this House in sending a clear and united message that the cycle of violence and bloodshed needs to end now. Tentative reports this afternoon that there has been a lull in violence and that a ceasefire may be approaching are welcome. I hope all sides will use their influence to end the conflict and recommit to developing a peaceful settlement. I, along with my colleagues, would say that the UN Security Council has a role to play here. It is important that we collectively use our voice in this Chamber to say that we want to see a peaceful resolution in the Middle East as quickly as possible for the people of the Middle East.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I begin by clarifying for Deputy Calleary that just because I am from Dublin does not mean there is no benefit for me from this legislation. There are farms in Dublin too.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Perhaps he was. I welcome the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021, which updates the fair deal scheme to give greater protections for farm families and small business owners. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on her work in bringing the legislation forward in such a short period. Since her election to the House in 2016, the fair deal scheme has been in her focus. Now, after only ten months of being in office, she has brought it to fruition. I thank her for that. It has always been a priority for her and the update to the policy is very welcome. I also take this opportunity to thank her for her efforts on the vaccine roll-out programme. She has always been very available to Deputies on all sides of the House in dealing with individual queries, which is greatly appreciated by all of us. The nursing home support scheme has been in operation since 2009. As of 31 December 2020, there were 22,755 people participating in the scheme, at an annual cost of just more than €1 billion. Participants contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant's means are assessed as 50% of the couple's combined income and assets. The first €36,000 of an individual's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The overall aim of the scheme is that participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means, while the State pays the balance of the cost. Where an individual's assessed weekly contribution is greater than the cost of care, he or she does not qualify for financial support. Therefore, applicants with substantial assets or incomes are unlikely to qualify for financial support. The capital value of individuals' principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the scheme for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap. Currently, this unqualified cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses, except where a farmer or business owner suffers a sudden illness or disability and requires nursing home care as a result. The Bill seeks to address this issue by introducing additional safeguards into the scheme to protect further the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation. Reforming the fair deal scheme to support farm families and entrepreneurs was a firm commitment in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in the last general election. I am delighted to see progress being made in this regard. The change to the scheme, which Fianna Fáil has long sought, will mean that after a period of three years, the value of family-owned farms and businesses will no longer be taken into account when calculating the cost of a person's nursing home care.This will happen when a family successor commits to working the farm or taking on the business. This change is essential to the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses, allowing them to be passed down to the next generation. This will ensure that the fair deal scheme is fair, more accessible and more affordable for farm and business-owning families. This has been a hugely emotive issue for farm families and business owners in communities right across Ireland and one the Minister of State has acted on as promised. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the vulnerabilities of many older people, especially those living in long-term residential care. It is absolutely critical that public investment in long-term care services is maintained for those who need it and it should be increased as our population ages. We must see more capital investment in facilities for older people to allow them stay in their homes as long as possible - particularly the construction of more dedicated sheltered accommodation. I am thinking of the ones in my constituency such as Rochestown House in Sallynoggin, Beaufort day centre in Glasthule, Glasthule Buildings, Kilbegnet Close in Dalkey, Ailt and Óir in Glenageary and the list goes on. We are very fortunate in our urban area to have a number of different types of residential accommodation for our elderly which have been built up over time. However, that is not to say there is enough such accommodation. Not everybody wants to go into long-term residential care. The vast majority of older people want to live independently, as the Minister of State knows from her own engagement with the organisations and services for older people. However, it is essential that not only the private sector but the State looks to plan over the long term for residential care and residential settings. If we look at the financial contribution, Dublin City Council, for example, has used that quite successfully, although it must be said it was limited. I would like to see it used in other local authority areas, where people in private accommodation can, if they choose, sell that accommodation and look to step down into accommodation that is council-owned, provided through an associated housing body or through other agencies. It is very important that we look at this and plan now. Arguably, not enough planning has gone into it over the last number of years but it is essential we look not only at reforming fair deal, as we are doing today, but also at reform of accommodation and sheltered accommodation for those who may need it over the next number of years. I hope the Bill will receive cross-party support to ensure these welcome and necessary changes are introduced without delay. In the time I have left, I have a query for the Minister of State which she might come back to me on. I know she may not have the information to hand but I am wondering whether there is an inbuilt review of the fair deal system with this particular change. If the Minister of State has time she might come back to me on that. I am thinking of an automatic review in, perhaps, three years because while these changes are welcome, other changes may come to light over the next little while. I do not expect the Minister of State to have any answer to my final question today but her office might reply to me in writing. It concerns the promotion and better understanding in the public domain of the power of attorney. It is really important that knowledge and understanding of that system is out there. It is not only about, as I said, planning for people's accommodation needs into the future but so people can actually plan for their future if anything happens with their mental or physical needs into the future.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss and debate the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2021. It is important that this legislation be discussed and debated in this House and that we examine it in detail. The background to this debate is also important. Since the pandemic struck last March, more than 4,941 deaths have been reported and I express my condolences to all those families and individuals impacted. In addition, more than a quarter of a million cases of Covid-19 have been recorded here in Ireland. I also express my thanks to all the front-line workers who have looked after us all throughout the pandemic, namely, the doctors, nurses, hospital staff, supermarket workers, the wonderful Dublin Bus drivers and other transport workers and of course the gardaí and fire fighters. They, and many others, have been key to us tackling the pandemic up and down the country. They all answered the call and kept the country going throughout the worst of the pandemic, especially in the early days when the full potential impact of Covid-19 was unknown. The past 15 months have been a long road with ups and downs. We are now, thankfully, approaching the final leg of the journey. We have come a long way, but we are not there yet. The Chief Medical Officer has signalled concern about the growth in cases of the new Indian variant. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cathal Crowe, regarding the measures we must take concerning travel. While there is strong confidence that our vaccinations are effective against the variant, we still have a way to go to ensure the vast majority of our population has received its first inoculation. It will likely be late July or early August before we achieve the figure of 80% of adults having been fully vaccinated. The vaccination programme is going well, better than many forecast, including Deputies in this House, and it will be possible to reopen society and the economy further as that endeavour gathers pace. However, we must be cautious. If the Indian variant, or another unknown variant, were to become established here now, it could cause a fourth wave, despite all the vaccinations. Schools and colleges must be a focus of our reopening in September. That must be a priority, as I am sure it is for the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues. I support the continuation of this legislation on the basis that we have the tools ready to protect our economy and society if necessary. That said, however, there are certain elements of which the Minister will be aware, such as statutory instruments, that we need to revise. One of those concerns religious services. The Garda has powers but if retained, they might be utilised and we do not want to see that happening.  If we are going to reopen the economy and society, we must ensure that it is a process, which is free of any unintended consequences. Equally, consideration must be given to day care services in this regard. I have spoken about this issue many times. We must also put a timeline in place for that area, because the elderly need it. I also spoke to the Minister previously about drive-in movies, and the little lacuna there which needs to be resolved in the new announcements on Friday, hopefully. While I hope that the legislation will not be used to any great degree in the months to come, obviously, we want to avoid any further waves or mass infection.  We have, however, seen some parties in this House today take wildly different views on the Covid-19 strategy. In one week they call for us to follow the NPHET advice and then in the next, they call for a zero Covid strategy, while recently also demanding universal mandatory hotel quarantine for all travellers to Ireland. Today, they are questioning the very framework that underpins the public health strategy. It is quite a journey for some of those parties. I do not know where they stand or whether a different decision will be reached by them next week. They go from one extreme to the other, like an autumn leaf in the wind. They are constantly blowing around and coming up with different strategies. I note that some of them are not here this afternoon. In contrast, however, the Government has generally taken a sensible, stable and cautious approach to the management of the pandemic and to the roll-out of the vaccination programme. It has been difficult at times for all of us, as it has for the Minister and his colleagues. I am sure there will be other bumps along the road during the reopening of the economy and society. It is challenging, and we knew it would be going into this process, because we are in unprecedented times. This strategy is working, though, and, thankfully, we are making good progress on the road leading us out of this pandemic. I call on all Deputies to support the extension of this legislation for a limited time. Let us finish the journey and lead Ireland out of this pandemic. I ask the Minister, in whatever time he may have left, to respond to me regarding the statutory instruments. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister and Ministers of State for taking questions this morning. Recent indications suggest that the roll-out is continuing at pace, with more than 2.5 million vaccinations now having been administered and with more than 45% of all adults having received their first jab. Hopefully, that figure will have reached 50% by next week. It is most encouraging. As the Minister stated, it is a testament to doctors, nurses, GPs and all those involved in this great national effort to bring us out of the Covid pandemic. While all the indications are positive, we should be careful to note that only 15% of adults have received their second dose and are therefore fully vaccinated. We should be cautious over the next few short weeks until the majority of people have been fully vaccinated. This will allow us to accelerate the reopening, while being reassured that people who have been fully vaccinated are well protected against all known variants. I understand that almost 300,000 people were vaccinated last week and a similar number are expected to be vaccinated this week. I heard what the Minister said about being cautious around the delivery of supply. We have been here before, unfortunately, and it is out of our control. Hopefully, we will see the target of 400,000 vaccinations administered being hit in June and July, dependent on deliveries, of course. In the time remaining, I have three short questions for the Minister. The first concerns the opening of the vaccine booking portal for those aged 40 to 44. I heard this morning that a choice may be offered to those in that cohort. I ask the Minister to elaborate on that. The Minister mentioned the 38th vaccination centre being located in UCD, which I welcome. I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns of those in the south-east Dublin region. I ask the Minister to indicate when that centre is due to open. Finally, I wish to raise a point that I have raised with the Minister previously. It concerns the statutory instruments and restrictions on safe events such as drive-in movies and drive-in bingo. I see that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler is present in the Chamber. I thank her for attendance. Another issue about which I am passionate is the opening of day care centres. Many of the staff of these centres have been vaccinated, as have certain cohorts who work there in other capacities. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on when those centres will reopen.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, for bringing this robust motion before us. As many speakers said, the interference with Ryanair flight FR4978 by the Belarusian regime on Sunday, 23 May, was extremely worrying and frightening, especially for those on board. This Ryanair flight was operating between two EU capital cities, Athens and Vilnius, and was carrying more than 170 passengers, including many EU citizens, and six crew, when it was forced to land in Minsk by the military forces of the Belarusian regime. What would have happened if the flight had not co-operated with those instructions? As we know, it was escorted in the air, which is extremely worrying. The illegal removal and detention of Roman Protasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega, was a breach of all international norms and a gross violation of their human rights. This act of international piracy, committed by Alexander Lukashenko and his regime, was outrageous and cannot go unanswered. The brutality of the Lukashenko regime, now in its fifth term, is unprecedented and cannot be tolerated. The EU must respond firmly to this despicable crime and the ongoing repression and silencing of the opposition in Belarus. Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega must be released immediately. I will be continually asking through monthly parliamentary questions about their well-being until they are released. Sadly, every day, we continue to see the regular harassment and intimidation of Belarusian civil society, journalists and independent media, with unjust detentions and apparent attempts to criminalise human rights work. The repression of the Belarusian people, who are peacefully and courageously defending their democratic and human rights, is totally unacceptable. As we heard from my Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Haughey, the 2020 Belarusian election was rigged, with Lukashenko receiving less than 25% of the popular vote. Fianna Fáil rejects the democratic and moral legitimacy of the Lukashenko regime and supports the Belarusian people in their demand for new and free elections, under the supervision of independent observers. I welcome the European Council’s strong condemnation of the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and the detention of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega. The move to restrict EU flights from Belarusian airspace is welcome, as are plans to increase economic and political sanctions on the leaders of the Lukashenko regime. I call on the Minister to raise the hijacking of Ryanair flight FR4978 and the other crimes of the Belarusian regime at the UN Security Council. There are currently 421 political prisoners in Belarus. I support the Government’s motion calling for the immediate release of Roman Protasevich, Sofia Sapega and all those unjustly detained in Belarus. It states that the Dáil rejects the democratic legitimacy of Alexander Lukashenko following the fraudulent 9 August 2020 elections, and that Ireland stands in solidarity with the Belarusian people in their peaceful defence of democratic principles and fundamental human rights.As we heard earlier, people are protesting peacefully outside the Dáil today, not only trying to raise the plight of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega but of all those who have been impacted since the regime took hold. It is important, as we have heard unanimously across the House, that people stand in solidarity today. It underscores the seriousness of what took place a few days ago. It is really important that the Government is able to speak with one voice on behalf of the people of Ireland to articulate our concerns and that of our European counterparts that this should not and will not be tolerated and that we stand in solidarity with the Belarusian people. I hope this motion passes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I just want to bring to the Taoiseach's attention the new national trauma system, especially for children, which came into force in March of this year. Last weekend, a child from Listowel, unfortunately, suffered a major head injury after being hit by a car. The National Ambulance Service advanced paramedics assisted the boy at the scene, assessed him and decided he required to be airlifted to Temple Street Children's Hospital to be assessed by neurosurgeons there. This was the first and successful test of this new national trauma system. The previous national protocols would require that a patient, particularly a child, would be assessed in the local hospital and then moved to Temple Street if required. The new national trauma system enables clinicians to get the patient to the right location and into the right care in a speedy fashion. I compliment Keith Synnott, the national lead for trauma services, and, obviously, the National Ambulance Service for the work it does-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----and Temple Street hospital. I wish the boy a speedy recovery.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am unsure whether Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan is above me. If he comes in I am happy to share my time with him. I welcome the opportunity to discuss and comment on the national recovery and resilience plan, NRRP, presented to the European Commission. With the EU-wide investment of €915 billion the NRRP will be an important component in reigniting the European economy as we recover from Covid-19 and Brexit, as the Minister has said. The recovery and resilience plan will enable us to move beyond the pandemic and invest in the future in key areas, such as climate change and digital transition. The plan will underpin the Government's national economic recovery plan launched yesterday and will continue to support the much-needed Covid-19 business and job supports. The overall objective of the national recovery and resilience plan is to contribute to the sustainable, equitable, green and digital recovery effort. It complements the Government's broader recovery plan. The recovery and resilience facility is the largest component of Next Generation EU, the European Union's €750 billion response to the global pandemic. The aim of Next Generation EU is to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the pandemic and to prepare for a post-covid Europe that is greener, more sustainable and that has greater digital interaction. Ireland is expected to receive €915 million in grants under the facility in 2021 and 2022. A further set of grants is to be allocated in 2023 taking into account our economic progress and developments between now and then. I particularly welcome the provision of a low-cost residential retrofit loan scheme to support the retrofitting of homes. That is included in the programme for Government. I welcome the investment in public transport and the support for schools information technology and retraining young people impacted by Covid-19. I look forward to witnessing the roll out of the 16 projects mentioned by the Minister under the plan. I thank the Minister and his officials for finalising and submitting the plan to the EU. I am unsure whether my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, is here as of yet.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We have various national and EU plans which have been worked on. It has been a long 15 months. Certainly, this will go a long way. It gives the Government and all of us certainty on the funding required for the mammoth task of supporting businesses and the young people who have been so badly impacted by the pandemic as well as the industries referred to by the Minister. It is most welcome. It is a good opportunity for the House to discuss the various needs. I look forward to it being implemented.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2021, which updates and consolidates the State’s maritime jurisdiction legislation. As a representative of the maritime constituency of Dún Laoghaire, I welcome this legislation. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for preparing this important Bill and for introducing it to the House. The State’s existing maritime jurisdiction legislation has been developed in a piecemeal fashion, reflecting ongoing development of the international law of the sea over the past 60 years. The Oireachtas first made legislative provision for Ireland’s maritime jurisdiction in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 1959. That Act established the outer limit of the territorial sea at three nautical miles, the so-called three-mile limit, and made provision for a straight baseline system from which part of that limit could be measured. The 1959 Act was amended in 1964 to give effect to the London convention on fisheries, where states had agreed to establish the 12-mile exclusive fishery limits. The Continental Shelf Act 1968 conferred power on the Government to designate seabed, beyond the territorial sea, as Irish continental shelf in accordance with emerging international agreement on this issue.  In 1976, following political agreement at the United Nations, EEC member states agreed to extend their exclusive fisheries limits to 200 nautical miles and an order under the 1959 Act to this effect was made by the Government. Following the Second World War, as the range and scale of human activity at sea greatly increased, pressure developed to allow coastal states to extend their jurisdiction further out to sea. This was resisted by some states that placed more value on preserving the freedoms of the high seas. These competing views were finally settled with the adoption in 1982 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, at Montego Bay, Jamaica. The 1982 convention is a comprehensive constitution for the oceans that establishes the legal framework for the regulation of all activities in, on and under the sea. The convention fixed the maximum breadth of the territorial sea at 12 nautical miles and established a new maritime zone, the exclusive economic zone. This zone, which may extend to a maximum distance of 200 nautical miles, is a compromise between the two competing views. Today's Bill brings the State’s maritime jurisdiction law up to date, reflecting in particular the development of international law represented by the UNCLOS which was ratified by the State in 1996. The Bill sets out in detail the sovereign rights and jurisdiction the State may exercise on the continental shelf and within the exclusive economic zone, where increased levels of activity and development are expected to take place in coming years, in particular the production of offshore renewable energy. It should be noted this Bill is separate to the proposed maritime area planning Bill referred to by Deputy Canney, which will seek to regulate wind farms. The aim of this Bill is to consolidate the existing legislation, creating a clear statement of the State’s rights and duties in each of its maritime zones. It will help to avoid errors in making and considering planning applications. The Bill will address the absence of policies and principles guiding the existing statutory power to designate the continental shelf and the limits of the State’s other maritime zones, a constitutional issue identified by the Attorney General, by linking it to the detailed rules set out in UNCLOS. The new Bill will preserve the existing boundaries and seaward limits established to date for each maritime zone and provide order-making powers for the Government to prescribe boundaries and limits agreed with neighbours or established under UNCLOS processes.It should be noted that there are a number of unresolved issues in the north east Atlantic Ocean and in the Celtic Sea, as well as coastal issues at Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. This Bill has no direct impact on the Rockall dispute. However, given recent events it is an opportune moment to reassert that Ireland does not recognise the UK's territorial claim to Rockall. Rockall cannot sustain human habitation or economic life and therefore cannot form the basis of a 12-mile territorial claim nor a claim to its own exclusive economic zone under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. I would call on Irish authorities to continue to engage with their UK counterparts to de-escalate the fishing disputes around the islet and negotiate a permanent agreement that reflects international law. While this Bill consolidates the legal framework that supports our territorial and economic claims, it is crucially important that the Government makes investments in practical means to asserting our rights. More investment needs to be made, for example, in maritime science, along with further investment in our Naval Service, the Irish Coast Guard and in other areas.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As the House will not be sitting tomorrow, I would like the Dáil to recall the late Detective Garda Colm Horkan, who died while on duty in Roscommon on 18 June 2020. Irish citizens living abroad who received the Sinopharm vaccine, among others, and who are now considered fully vaccinated by the World Health Organization, are facing discrimination by EU and Irish authorities by being compelled to enter mandatory hotel quarantining if returning to Ireland from various countries. What does the Government intend to do to vindicate their rights?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Hourigan. I welcome this discussion on the impact the Covid pandemic has had on people with disabilities and their families. I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Madigan and Rabbitte, for giving their time to the debate this evening. In particular, I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and her staff to prioritise people with disabilities during the pandemic. She has been available to Deputies on all sides of the House at all times and this is greatly appreciated. It is important to acknowledge that the Covid pandemic has had a devastating impact on people with disabilities, their families and service providers. It was encouraging to see services resume in special schools from 22 February last, as well as in-class teaching from March. I pay tribute to everyone working in the sector, particularly teachers, SNAs, transport and sanitation workers and everybody who made school facilities safe to reopen. However, I have been made aware of difficulties arising for certain healthcare workers and others who are still awaiting their second AstraZeneca vaccination. I ask the Ministers of State to raise that matter with the HSE. I am aware that a statement was issued some days ago in this regard but it is important that we see the issue resolved as soon as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has gone to considerable lengths to meet with parents' groups in my constituency, such as the parents of children in Carmona Services and she organised a meeting with stakeholders earlier this week. That was greatly appreciated. Perhaps she will refer in her closing statement to the implementation of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme in special schools, with particular reference to the need to ensure services remain based on site. The cyberattack the HSE has had to grapple with in the shadow of the pandemic also has had a devastating impact on its ability to provide services. For us in this House, it has had a particular impact on our ability to represent our constituents. It is imperative that the parliamentary question system, as it interacts with the HSE, be restored as soon as possible. Will the Minister of State speak to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, about this? It is important that the facility resumes as soon as possible. In the time remaining, I want to refer to the July provision. While the recent announcement is crucial and very welcome, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan, that an online portal might be the best way to proceed.It is cumbersome, particularly for the schools that do not offer the service. Parents have to seek July provision at home. That presents its own challenges. For many parents with children who have disabilities, it is tough for them to continuously go out and seek services. If services were available easily at the click of a button, or indeed if it were easier to apply for them, it would be easier for all of them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply to that question. Are there any plans to develop a national security strategy? The previous Government went to develop a national security strategy in 2019, with the process led by the national security analysis centre. I understand there was also a short consultation process undertaken at that time, over three weeks which included Christmas holidays. Were the results of that consultation ever published? I note what the Taoiseach said on the confidentiality around this committee and I appreciate that. However, if there is an intention to publish the results of the consultation, can the Taoiseach outline that to us? With regard to the recent cyberattack on both on the HSE and the Department of Health, which the Taoiseach referred to in his response and which obviously caused huge disruption right across the health system, has this National Security Committee met since that attack? Given the impact of that cyberattack, does the Taoiseach believe a general review of the State's cyber and general security apparatus should be undertaken?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On behalf of Deputy Lawless, I thank the Taoiseach for his response regarding the national risk assessment. The assessment began in 2014, there was another in 2019 and the most recent one was deferred. From my assessment, I understand that the level of spending in Ireland on defence in 2019 was 0.2% of GDP. By my calculations, that is far too low, even by the standards of any comparable neutral country. In a recent budget there was a bigger annual increase for the military pensions than there was for day-to-day defence expenditure. Could the Taoiseach have this examined, perhaps by reference to other similar neutral countries for instance, Finland, Sweden and Austria? It is an important issue and we need to take account of it. Given that the assessment has not been done yet, as we are going to head into a new cycle it is important that we go in with a view to spending more to ensure the outcome is better.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will start by acknowledging the successful roll-out out of the vaccination programme. This morning, I had the pleasure of attending the vaccination centre at the Aviva Stadium. I acknowledge the hard work, dedication and friendliness of the front-line healthcare workers there and right across the country. Worryingly, however, we have seen the increased transmissibility of the Delta and Delta plus variants, both in the UK and in other jurisdictions. I acknowledge that it is the objective of Government to want to reopen schools and colleges in September. It is important to remind ourselves that we must protect young people who have underlying health conditions, however. The European Medicines Agency has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children between the ages of 12 to 16, and indeed, Belgium has already begun rolling out the programme for that age cohort. Does the Government have a plan to do likewise in this State?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for introducing this important Bill, which is long overdue. I thank the Minister for the €5 million allocated to Dublin City Council today to tackle void homes. We look forward to such funding for other local authorities. This is the first ever legislation that focuses purely on affordable housing. It is a significant intervention in the housing market that will put affordability at the heart of the housing system. The Bill has four key elements that will help increase the supply and availability of affordable housing. It creates a legal framework to support local authorities directly building affordable homes and this will result in thousands of new affordable homes directly built by councils. It establishes the first national cost-rental or affordable rental scheme, which will give people who want to rent but earn above the social housing support limit discounted rates and indefinite leases. The Bill establishes a new shared equity scheme to help first-time buyers bridge the funding gap and purchase their first home. It rightly sets a cap on these prices. It also expands the Part V social housing provision to 20%, and this means all new housing schemes will include 20% social and affordable public housing. This will set aside thousands of new homes for public housing. I am heartened by what appears to be a cross-party consensus for the Bill. We discussed it many times and there was indication that there would be opposition but I welcome that Deputies from all parties, particularly those from the Opposition, will support the Bill today. I hope we can continue to work in the vein of consensus to ensure we can deliver the provisions in the Bill. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The right decision was taken last September to postpone the census until 3 April next year. It is important to proceed and gather that information from the census so policymakers can make the right decision over the next ten years. Perhaps the Minister of State could detail the contingencies in place to ensure the census will happen next April. A colleague has raised the question of the 1926 census, data from which are due to be published in 2026. Will the Minister of State consider doing that earlier? That census was taken at a tumultuous time for the State and the previous census was taken in 1911. It would be important to look at publishing it a bit earlier. There would be some great tourism and heritage benefits in this, especially for those who live abroad and who might come to the State to trace their roots. It is important that we look to try to publish that information as soon as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for his time. I want to raise the issue of the Irish Naval Service. It has a very proud track record, not only in serving Ireland but within the EU and in Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean. As Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in 2017, I had the pleasure of awarding the freedom of entry to the LÉ Eithne in Dún Laoghaire. Colleagues have raised the issue of contracts, which is important. Improved conditions are required. I welcome the fact that a recruitment campaign is under way. The Naval Service was berthed on the quays the other day. The Minister might articulate for the House when we will see a return to full capacity in the Naval Service.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome that and note the comments of the Minister on recruitment. As I said, I have witnessed that myself. The Defence Forces have a wonderful social media presence and have communicated their message about the recruitment campaign, apprenticeships and all sorts of other activities over the years successfully. I note the comments of the Minister on the flagship LÉ Eithne. As he is probably aware, it is twinned with Dún Laoghaire Harbour, something that we are very proud of. I ask that if funding is to be released for a replacement for LÉ Eithne, consideration be given to continue to twin a ship with Dún Laoghaire. It is an important connection, given the size of the harbour and its strategic importance.  I also note what the Minister said about the two reserve ships. Effectively, there are eight ships, and one is currently under midlife repair. I ask the Minister to provide a note on the LÉ Eithne and the LÉ Orla.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From my perspective, the main issue is the twinning of the ships. I note the great service of the LÉ Eithne , along with other ships, and the personnel that have crewed all of the various ships over the years. I ask that consideration be given to twinning between Dún Laoghaire and the replacement for the LÉ Eithne whenever that happens in the short term. As I said, I acknowledge the work that is under way. I support the Minister's call for fully manned ships. Post the recruitment campaign and the encouragement of other personnel to come back to the Naval Service and the wider Defence Forces, that is important. I look forward to further updates from the Minister.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will. Do not worry.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will the Minister report on the level of day-to-day spending in the Defence Forces annualised as a percentage of GDP in each of the years from 2016 to 2020, including an estimate for the current year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for those figures and I welcome the various increases the Minister referred to from 2016 to the present. Given the pandemic, there will undoubtedly be further increases. I wish to focus on the cyberattack. Obviously, great work is done by the Defence Forces across the board, but given the recent impact of the attack on our health service and the Minister's comments earlier about the European element and co-operation, which is interesting and we will focus on that in the next week or so in our questions, is the Minister aware of the Norwegian Cyber Defence Force, which was established in 2012? I understand it has a complement of approximately 1,500 personnel. In view of Ireland's key pillar of fintech, pharmaceutical and other important industries, it is important that the country and Government would focus on funding and having a resilient anti-cyberattack strategy. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely, and I welcome the Minister's comments in that regard. I know it is not just the Minister's portfolio. I raised this issue last week with the Tánaiste and the need to ensure there is funding and, indeed, a review of all the various strategies from the Government and industry. It is important that we have a robust system and that we invest in it, given the unfortunate and decimating experience in the last few weeks. That said, it would be important to have a structural and technological change as well as a mindset from the Government to ensure we can thwart, as much as possible, any future cyberattacks. I welcome the Minister's comments about the potential co-operation at European level. That makes absolute sense. As the Minister said about our peacekeepers, if we can use resources adequately and smartly, it will be a benefit not only to Ireland but across Europe.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to talk about the Land Development Agency again. It is important before the Bill is finalised to put on record the need for this agency to be established. As Deputy Crowe said, many Members of this House came from councils and over the last decade in particular, so much land was discussed that was never developed by the local authorities for various reasons. This changes that. On Deputy Mattie McGrath's point earlier, there was a commitment that this legislation would be passed by the end of term. The Minister is keeping that and it is right. We have all said ad nauseam that housing is so important in this State and this will unlock and develop land we badly need. The Minister and his officials have brought this legislation through the pre-legislative scrutiny stage at the housing committee. It is important to see discussion among Deputies all across the House. They have put forward ideas and suggestions on the LDA. The objective of this Bill is to establish the LDA on a statutory footing. That is an important principle and, while there have been previous attempts to establish it, this will put it in place and fund it. Targeting large areas, Dublin and Cork in particular, for 100% public homes on public land is important. Shanganagh in my area has been referred to. We have more than 600 homes earmarked for that. That was talked about for nearly a decade and is good to see this through the LDA and the Affordable Housing Bills being passed. It is important we see progress being made on those sites and others. We are not just talking about local authority land; we are also talking about other State land, as was referred to earlier. That is an important point of this Bill. Some agencies have large tracts of land, have no intention of developing them or have never looked at them for housing purposes. The LDA will piece that together and deliver and increase housing, something I hope all Deputies want. The public have demanded it in the last 12 months. When the public was asked about it, housing was the key issue. The Government is responding to it. The Minister has worked extremely hard on it and for that I commend him. It is important we have the LDA Bill passed this evening.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is nice to be back in this Chamber. I hope it will be possible to return to Leinster House in September. I speak about the vaccination programme this morning in a totally different context from when I have spoken previously. I acknowledge the 5,000 people who have sadly passed away during the pandemic and I express my condolences to their families, friends and loved ones. Anyone who watched last night’s "Prime Time" programme on nursing homes will have been struck by the sense of sadness and anger at conditions in some of the nursing homes. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler's, comments about investigating the issue. As a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, I also support a public inquiry into the issues raised. There will be others. News of a fourth wave of the pandemic, driven by the Delta variant, has come as a disappointment, both here in this Chamber and across the country. We all hoped that this pandemic was in our rear-view mirror but we must prepare once again as a society as we face into a fourth wave for the impact it will have on our society, economy and health service. It is devastating news for the hospitality sector. I urge all Ministers to work together to find an innovative solution in the period ahead, including antigen testing, which I have spoken about before. I hope there will be no need to roll back the easing of restrictions that has been achieved to date. Thankfully, Ireland is well placed to face a fourth wave. More than 4.1 million doses have been administered. About 67% of adults have now had their first jab with almost 45% fully vaccinated. We are told by EU and Irish medical experts that all four vaccines licensed in the EU are extremely effective against the Delta variant. This is extremely reassuring. Uptake of the vaccine has been extraordinary. It is at 99% for people over 80, 98% for people in their 70s, and 92% for people aged 60 to 69. This is well ahead of EU averages which are as low as 76% in many states. I am hopeful that our extremely high uptake in older people and people with underlying health conditions will pay dividends as the fourth wave begins to be established. The vaccines also appear to limit the transmission of the Delta variant. Therefore, it is critical that we accelerate the vaccination programme with all possible speed. I welcome the Minister's comments that the portal will open from next Friday for people aged 30 to 34. News that experts on the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, have approved the use of AstraZeneca and the one-shot Janssen vaccine for everyone over 18 if they wish to be vaccinated early is also welcome. I note the Minister's comments this morning about the opt-in for that cohort. The reduction in the interval between AstraZeneca vaccine doses to four weeks is welcome. I know many people in the 60 to 69 cohort are still awaiting their second jab and are hoping for an appointment in the next two weeks. I ask NIAC to explore having an opt-in for the over 60 cohort if there are excess vaccines because a number expressed concern about the option facing them about what vaccine they were getting. I urge the Minister to ask NIAC to decide on vaccinations for children aged 12 to 15, especially those who would otherwise fall into group 4 or group 7, with a serious underlying condition that puts them at risk. I have raised this matter before and I understand that many hospital consultants have lists prepared and are awaiting the decision and that the HSE is drawing up plans. I note the European Medicines Agency, EMA, approved the measure some time ago. The Minister might come back to me about whether NIAC cited any reason for what seems to be an undue delay. We need to offer these children a vaccination as soon as possible and certainly before the return to school in September.The Minister might also confirm if he expects most teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to be fully vaccinated before the return to school.  I join with the Minister in expressing my gratitude and that of the House to all those working on, and administering, the vaccination programme across the now 40 national centres, pharmacies and other healthcare centres. Feedback has been very positive, but I ask the Minister to ensure there are proper facilities for people with disabilities. I will forward details to the Minister of feedback I have received in this regard. It is wonderful to see 692,000 vaccinations arrive this week, with another 1 million due over the course of July and more again in August. I wish everyone involved in the programme every success as they ramp up administration to protect Ireland from the worst effects of a potential fourth wave. The Minister's comments on this morning's "Morning Ireland", and in his opening speech this morning, are welcome. It seems that a lot of work and preparation has gone into what is facing us in the next couple of months. Hopefully, with the co-operation of all in this House, we can put out positive messages, get engagement and keep the co-operation of the public as we face into the next couple of months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am not sure what happened. I apologise to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for that. It is really important that we discuss this topic today. Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence has been a priority of mine. Since I was first elected to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I have repeatedly pressed for an increase in the number of refuge places and the establishment of a dedicated facility in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown. As a State and society, we must do more to support people, mainly women and children but also men, who are subject to domestic violence. I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as a priority. During the pandemic, we saw an increase in domestic violence. It continues to be a pervasive problem in our society. Unfortunately, figures for 2020 show that the Garda received more than 43,000 calls to respond to domestic abuse incidents, representing a 16% increase on the figure for 2019. Nearly 15% of women between the ages of 18 and 74 have experienced some form of physical and sexual violence in their lifetimes and nearly 31% have experienced psychological violence. In May, the Department of Justice launched a public consultation process in partnership with Safe Ireland, which coincidentally is having a talk as we speak, and the National Women's Council of Ireland to inform the development of a new strategy, the third, to combat the problem. This strategy will emphasise prevention and reduction and is to be agreed by the Government by the end of this year. This is welcome and necessary. The new strategy must be supported with resources that provide practical measures to make it easier for victims to report crimes, access justice and protect their families. We need all agencies to step up. Reference was made earlier to the inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls. I welcome the Garda Commissioner's statement and apology for that. The cross-government budget to tackle domestic and sexual violence must be increased in 2022 to ensure bodies such as the Garda and Tusla and NGOs such as Safe Ireland, Woman's Aid and Men's Aid Ireland have sufficient resources.  The provision of emergency accommodation to allow people to exit abusive relationships is critical, particularly given the issues concerning the general shortage of housing, with which we are all familiar. I understand Tusla is finalising a review of emergency accommodation nationwide. I hope this review will result in a joined-up policy. For far too long, we have seen refuges fall through the bureaucratic cracks. As I mentioned, from 2009 I, first as a member of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, and others have been pushing for a refuge in the south-east of Dublin but, unfortunately, owing to the stance of both the council and Tusla — it was the HSE at the time — it has never taken hold. This is not good enough and it must change. Women and men and their children all across Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the rest of the country deserve better. We need a single lead agency to take responsibility for planning, funding and the construction of the family refuges. We also need to see practical measures to support victims, including paid leave to attend court, faster access to housing support and generous allowances from community welfare officers to offer support in meeting day-to-day needs as victims break free from abusive relationships.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister for taking this question. Is he aware that some parents have not received child benefit payments this month? I have received several reports of child benefit payments for children aged 16 being suspended. Before the onset of Covid-19, parents were required to have a form stamped by school authorities confirming that their child was proceeding into fourth or fifth year. The requirement was deferred last year because of the pandemic. I understand that many parents were not aware of this requirement and some did not receive forms. They now find themselves without child benefit payments. This will clearly have implications as preparations are made for the return to school in September. I contacted the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, asking her to investigate this issue. Groups such as Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, and Barnardos Ireland have also been in contact with the Department of Social Protection. Will the Minister raise this issue with the Minister for Social Protection to ensure that payments will be reinstated, pending certification, in September?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will speak briefly before we finish discussing the Bill. It is apt to mention that, since we last debated it, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County has approved the tender for the largest affordable housing site in the country. It will be 9 ha of social, affordable and cost-rental housing. I have spoken about it previously, but the debate on the Bill is an appropriate place to raise it again because it shows that this approach is beginning to work on the ground. I thank the Minister, particularly for the final subsection of section 5, which acknowledges those who, for whatever reason, may not be eligible for social housing. I hope that they will be able to apply for this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021, which will enable the reopening of indoor hospitality and amend the mandatory hotel quarantine regulations. I am very uneasy about introducing domestic vaccination certificates on principle and also on logistical grounds. It is not something I would normally ever consider supporting. However, we find ourselves in an incredibly challenging position. The delay in reopening indoor hospitality was very disappointing. Many of these businesses have been closed for almost 500 days. I ask Deputies, particularly those who spoke before me today, to cast their minds back to when the easing of restrictions was announced. There was utter shock across the nation, particularly in the indoor hospitality sector. In the past week, business owners have contacted me asking for an opportunity to reopen safely as soon as possible.They want a chance to trade, particularly over the busy summer months. We have heard opposition to the proposal from many Deputies in the House, much of it is reasonable, but none has outlined a detailed proposal or alternative that would see hospitality safely reopen during the summer. I will support this emergency Bill if two important clauses are included, which I believe they are. There must be a sunset clause, which is provided for at three months, and the provisions must end as soon as possible, which we are told will be October. There must also be provision for testing, antigen and PCR, and it must be operationalised as soon as possible. On this basis, I will support the legislation to give hospitality a chance to reopen over the summer. The rhetoric from some Deputies this afternoon about leaving indoor hospitality closed until September, October or some unknown point is extremely unfair. The sector deserves a chance to reopen. The Deputies in question fail to recognise that we are entering a new phase of the pandemic. Almost 60% of people are now fully vaccinated. We have spoken about this many times in the House in recent weeks. More than 70% of people have received at least one jab. Almost all those aged between 60 and 69 will be fully vaccinated by the end of this week. Those aged between 18 and 29 years will have the option to register for an AstraZeneca vaccination from this week, in addition to access to the Janssen vaccine from their pharmacies. Attempts to conjure up a “Downton Abbey” type scenario and sow social division are very unfair and worrying. The Government listened and brought forward access to vaccinations for everybody over the past weeks. Young people have embraced this, as is evident in the enormous demand for the Janssen vaccine. I encourage the Minister for Health to go further and consider opening pop-up and walk-in vaccination centres in larger towns and cities to allow everyone who wishes to avail of a vaccination to do so. I note the Bill also proposes to make a number of changes to the mandatory hotel quarantine regime to streamline the regulations and deal with a number of anomalies. These changes are welcome. Many have been called for by Deputies in the House and they should also be supported. I will support this legislation on the basis that it gives hospitality a chance to reopen. It is on a limited basis that we do so. We have heard some Deputies call for everything to be reopened but this ignores the associated risks. Others propose to leave society and hospitality closed for months by taking a wait-and-see approach. That is unacceptable and it is not what the industry has looked for. We must continue the process of reopening society. We said from as early as last March that it would be much easier to close down sectors than to reopen them. It is important that we also reflect on that element. We knew we would be in this position and that there would be challenges. I accept this is not a perfect situation but it is one that the hospitality sector have discussed at length with the Government with regard to how we might proceed with reopening. We must continue that process of reopening society. Is this Bill perfect? No. We accept that and it has been said many times. Are there issues with it? Yes, but the sunset clause means the legislation must come back to the Oireachtas if it is to be extended. I hope that when we get to October, we will be in a different position. I believe everyone in the House is agreed that we will be at a different point in October. Everybody wants that. We are all coming from a good place on this, which is imperative for all of us. If we were not seeking to reopen indoor hospitality with this Bill, the Deputies criticising these proposals would be castigating the Government for not doing enough for the sector. The sector has spoken and has been listened to. Its decision is to reopen as soon as possible using this method. A practical proposal to move the situation forward is before us. On that basis, I support the Bill.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Could we have Deputy Murnane O'Connor first, please?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, for bringing the Bill forward and for listening to the observations of colleagues. My thanks to the Acting Chairman as well. This is a great opportunity for me to speak about the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Retail Credit and Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2021. As my colleague, Deputy Murnane O'Connor, stated, the Bill is long overdue. Certain changes in the regulations were required. The Bill is timely and necessary.The primary purpose of this legislation is to protect the consumer by ensuring that any person or firm carrying on a business of providing credit, hire purchase, personal contract plan, PCP, or consumer hire agreements to consumers or other relevant persons will fall within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank of Ireland. It will give the Central Bank the necessary legislative powers to apply its consumer protection code, or any other relevant code, to such firms. The Bill facilitates the implementation of a key recommendation of the Tutty report, about which I will speak in a moment, on the operation of the personal contract plan, PCP, market. The report recommended that the Central Bank apply relevant provisions of the consumer protection code to all providers of hire purchase and PCP agreements where such financial products are being sold to consumers. It referred in particular to the code’s obligations on financial service providers to assess, prior to entering into a credit agreement, the financial capacity of the consumer and the suitability of the product for the consumer. As all providers of PCP and other similar agreements to consumers will now have to be authorised by the Central Bank, the bank will then be able to apply its consumer protection code and other consumer protection powers to such firms. This will improve the level of protection available to the consumers of such agreements. As has been widely reported, PCPs have become increasingly popular in recent years and now account for about 40% of car-related bank debt, having increased from about 15% in the middle of the last decade. PCPs generally offer lower monthly repayments to the buyer. They are particularly popular with car dealers as they increase the potential for repeat business. However, they are complex financial products involving a degree of risk. It is important people entering into such contracts are aware of what they may entail and the risks involved, particularly the significant balloon payments that can come as a nasty surprise at the end of some financing arrangements. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission carried out a study of the PCP market in 2018 and determined that the complexity of the product, combined with the potential for softening car prices on the second-hand market, risked causing "significant consumer detriment", a point that was emphasised by Frank Conway of the Irish Financial Review and Moneywhizz. While there has been a significant hardening in used car prices post-Brexit and during the Covid pandemic, this is still a medium to long-term concern. As I referred to earlier, a review of these financial products was carried out by Michael Tutty in 2018. The review stated that further consumer protections were necessary, hence this Bill. This legislation will ensure that all providers of hire purchase and PCP agreements will come under the regulation of the Central Bank.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	May I resume?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a few more remarks to make on the Bill. I thank the Acting Chairman. Section 2 is the key section. It amends section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997. Section 28 sets out the various definitions for the purposes of Part V of the 1997 Act and defines the scope of the Central Bank authorisation responsibilities in respect of "regulated businesses" that are involved in the provision of certain types of financial services. The Bill provides for widening the regulatory scope of "retail credit firms" and "credit servicing firms" so as to include also the direct and indirect provision and servicing of credit, hire purchase, PCP and consumer hire agreements as those agreements are currently defined in the Consumer Credit Act 1995. Accordingly, any entity which provides these types of agreements to relevant persons will now come within the authorisation and regulatory scope of the Central Bank. This will then allow the Central Bank to apply its consumer protection code and other consumer protection and relevant regulatory measures to such firms and therefore facilitate the implementation of the key Tutty report recommendation on PCPs, about which I spoke earlier. I welcome this pro-consumer legislation and am happy to support it. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and his officials for bringing it forward. I am not sure whether I will be able to get speaking time later on this afternoon but, as we conclude the term, a year into this Dáil, it is appropriate to thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and all the staff as this may be the last time we sit here in the convention centre. I hear many people who are happy with that but it is thanks to the convention centre and to the facilities that have been offered to the House over recent months and during the pandemic that we have been able to conduct our business safely. I thank the staff of the Oireachtas for the assistance and support they have provided to all Members of the House over recent months and for facilitating us. I also thank the gardaí, the ushers and everybody else involved. I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach for allowing me back in. I may touch on some other points if I have an opportunity to speak again later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Like my colleague, I welcome the opportunity to examine the Firearms and Offensive Weapons (Amendment) Bill 2021. I thank the Deputy for introducing this Bill last March. It seeks to increase the maximum prison sentence that can be imposed for the possession of knives. The Bill is a direct response to the increase in knife crime we have witnessed, unfortunately, in the capital and throughout Ireland. We have seen a spate of high-profile incidents, including Josh Dunne and others, in recent years. Physical or other types of assaults and knife crime constitute the worst nightmare of any parent of a teenage child or older. Statistics from the Garda demonstrate the problem is getting worse. In 2016, gardaí seized 1,200 knives. This rose to 1,600 in 2017 and a staggering 2,000 in 2018. It is clear we have an ongoing problem with the possession and use of knives, particularly in Dublin. The solution is not exclusively through the criminal justice system. We also need to recognise the need to educate young men and boys in particular about the dangers of carrying knives. Many of them carry knives for the purpose of seeking to defend themselves, not intending to use them. Often the carriers of knives become the victims of same. We have seen far too often the tragic experience that, on a night when a knife is used, people can lose their lives through being fatally stabbed. Lives are being destroyed, especially young lives. Part of the solution is in education. We need to provide more public information about the use and dangers of knives and to warn young people about the consequences that can arise from carrying a knife. It is not just young people. It is also men and women, as the Deputy alluded to in relation to domestic violence. We need to look at the criminal justice system. Fianna Fáil is of the opinion that the maximum sentence for carrying a knife for the purpose of trying to inflict harm on another person is far too low and should be increased to give a court greater discretion. This will not be the only solution but it sends a strong message to our community that it is unacceptable to carry knives. This Bill will amend the existing legislation to increase, from five to ten years, the maximum prison sentence that can be imposed for possession of a knife likely to injure, incapacitate or intimidate any person. The Bill is essential. It sends that strong message and recognises that knives can be just as dangerous as other offensive weapons. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is working on that and I thank him for being in the House. I know he will engage and work constructively on this. One aspect of Covid-19 was people reconnecting with their local open spaces. Anti-social behaviour, intimidation, racism and crime in these places is unacceptable and must be tackled. Everyone has the right to feel safe while enjoying public spaces in our cities, towns, villages and wider communities. In particular, we must feel safe here in our capital city of Dublin and it must be welcoming for everybody. Recent high-profile incidents have been unacceptable and more must be done to ensure communities are supported and streets and parks kept safe. This Bill is one part of a solution to tackle knife crime. We also need increased support for organisations working with communities and a continued Garda presence to deter such incidents. I welcome efforts by the Government in this regard, particularly the introduction of local community safety partnerships. These partnerships grew out of the reform of the joint policing committees that were established to work in each local authority area. They will draw up local community safety plans to address issues of concern in their local area. Three pilot projects are currently being established, in Dublin's north inner city, Waterford and Longford, and will run for the next two years ahead of a national roll-out. Projects like these will ensure public spaces are safe and can be enjoyed by everyone. I commend the Bill to the House and thank Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for his work in bringing it forward. I conclude by thanking the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for her assistance during our sittings in the convention centre. This may be our last time talking in this space. I also thank the ushers and all the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the convention centre for their help during the pandemic period.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Deputy Cahill for placing the NDP on the agenda. In respect of Dublin and questions over the MetroLink, I ask that it be prioritised in the NDP review, as well as DART underground. These are key infrastructure projects that were mooted previously and need to be retained on the agenda, as does the N11 interchange. Finally, coastal defence is required for Dublin Bay and that could perhaps be linked with the Sutton to Sandycove walkway and cycleway. All the projects are essential for Dublin and its expansion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I commend the Minister on initiating the review of the national lottery, which I believe is long overdue. When is it due to be completed?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note the figures the Minister gave for Ireland. In the UK, approximately 53% of every £1 spent goes to the prize funds, 25% goes to good causes, 12% goes to the UK Government as duty, 4% goes to the retailers and 5% goes to the operator, with 4% of that 5% for operating costs and 1% of it for profits. The Minister mentioned €6 billion for good causes in this country. What percentage of sales in the Irish system goes to good causes, prize funds, State levies and the operator? I appreciate the Minister might not have that information with him this morning, but he might forward it to me. While I know funds go to good causes in various sectors such as sport, culture, heritage, the arts, youth, welfare and amenities, can the Minister give the House an indication, or arrange to send us that information as well, of how much was allocated to each of those sectors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate the fact that the review is taking place. I am not sure if a review of this scale has been undertaken since 1987 so it is very important. The Minister highlighted the example of the sports clubs. All Members of the House have been contacted by sports clubs, community organisations and others that are eager to access any type of funding, but there has to be a clear pathway to that funding. It is very generous funding but we must have transparency. We discussed freedom of information earlier, so it is important that there is transparency in respect of funding for all the good causes that the national lottery has funded over the years and will fund in the future.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is the Tánaiste aware of the alarming trend of urban post offices closing and the impact this is having on communities? In that past year alone in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency, Monkstown and Foxrock post offices have closed. Residents in Dalkey were told this week that their local post office will be closing on Friday, 8 October, and that the postmaster is retiring after 14 years of service. On a personal note, I wish Christopher Good all the very best in his retirement and thank him and his staff for all the work they have done. An Post has advised that it is trying to get another post office into Dalkey but despite its best efforts, it has had no such luck to date. Dalkey is a town of almost 7,000 residents, on a par with Tuam, Ballinasloe and New Ross. It would be unthinkable for such a large town to lose its post office. I note that the programme for Government commits to maintaining the national post office network. Can the Tánaiste advise the House what the Government is doing to retain post offices in urban and rural areas? We do not want to lose any more of them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome today's discussion. At times, it has felt like a debate on the Housing for All programme. On that issue, when this legislation was being discussed in the summer, there were many debates in this House, although we were in the convention centre at the time. The issue had a very good airing. Obviously, some Deputies chose not to support it but ultimately all of us are coming from a good place on this. We all acknowledge that rents are too high. First-time buyers cannot access affordable housing and people are waiting years for social housing. It is clear the market-led system has failed. Everyone should have access to sustainable, good quality housing to rent or buy at an affordable price. Housing for All is a massive State intervention in the housing market that will deliver social and affordable housing. It will transform how we deliver housing across Ireland. Housing for All is a plan that will assist the squeezed middle in buying their first homes and ensure that families on lower incomes have access to social housing. It will transform communities. Housing for All will also facilitate a massive increase in the supply of housing. We often hear about the lack of supply in this Chamber. The plan commits to the delivery of 300,000 homes over its lifetime. These will include 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, 18,000 cost rental homes and 156,000 new private homes to rent or buy. The State is taking responsibility for delivering 50% of all housing over the next decade. People talked about radical change earlier on. This is a radical step. It involves a €20 billion investment over the next five years. By any measure, that is a massive intervention in the market and is unprecedented in the history of the State. Housing for All looks beyond housing output and includes commitments to increase rental protections, to eradicate homelessness, to introduce Kenny report-style powers with regard to land value and to establish a commission on housing. Housing for All provides a number of pathways to accessing housing. For first-time buyers, the plan will increase the supply of affordable housing to purchase. We have seen pilot schemes deliver these homes at €250,000 or under. The plan will deliver 36,000 new affordable homes, including thousands in Dún Laoghaire, where we are seeing the first homes being built in Shanganagh. The first house scheme gives first-time buyers a chance to bridge the funding gap, with the State taking an equity stake in homes.  For renters, Housing for All creates an entire new affordable cost-rental system whereby people will be able to rent at rates at least 25% below local rents. We have seen the first of these units let in Enniskerry Road in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and 200 more are planned in Shanganagh, in Shankill, County Dublin. It will also improve tenants' rights, place caps on deposits, cap rent increases and introduce tenancies of indefinite duration which will give people certainty in their homes. For people who need to access social housing, the plan will deliver 90,000 new social homes. Local authorities will again start building homes, supported by approved housing bodies like Tuath and Respond. Housing for All is an ambitious plan, as is recognised across the Chamber, but there will be challenges. The cost of construction needs to be addressed. We need to see reductions in input costs such as the €7,500 Irish Water levy; the equivalent is a mere €1,278 in the UK. We also need to see action on felling licences for timber. We need to address labour shortages. I welcome the plan to ramp up apprenticeships that is being pursued by the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins. There are also plans for a national centre of excellence to advance construction technology and methods. However, what is perhaps the biggest challenge is in this Chamber. I call on Deputies to get behind the plan. As one Opposition Deputy said earlier, we need houses now. We have a plan. Let us get behind it. The public will not thank Deputies who continue to play politics with their future.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before the summer recess, the Minister may recall that I raised the issue of Dún Laoghaire Harbour continuing to be twinned with a naval vessel should the LÉ Eithne be decommissioned. My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, mentioned the independent Commission on the Defence Forces, which the Minister said was established in December 2020 and was due to report by the end of the year. Does that timeline still stand? What are the prospects of a vessel continuing to be twinned with Dún Laoghaire Harbour?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister very much for those remarks, particularly about the connection between Dún Laoghaire Harbour and the Naval Service. That is a connection we want to maintain, as I am sure he can appreciate. I am also glad that he raised the 75th anniversary of our Naval Service. It is important to acknowledge the great work undertaken by our Naval Service and the wider Defence Forces. The Minister mentioned Operation Pontus in the Mediterranean, for which the LÉ Eithne and the Naval Service were awarded freedom of entry to the county, and how the EU awarded our Defence Forces in 2015 for their work. It is important to recognise the thousands of lives our Naval Service and Defence Forces have saved, particularly in the Mediterranean. Can the Minister outline the current scope of operations being undertaken by our Defence Forces in that region at present?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	While we are on the subject of the Defence Forces, I thank the Minister for meeting with the Women of Honour group and those women who are currently serving in our Defence Forces, and for his actions and statements on behalf of the Government for instigating an independent investigation. I pay tribute to those brave women who have stepped forward to speak out about their own experiences, and to the fantastic work done by Katie Hannon of RTÉ, and, indeed, Dr. Tom Clonan and others, in uncovering these types of issues. The Minister might inform the House when the investigation is due to begin.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, like Deputy Farrell, I have a particular interest in this debate. The committee spent much of the past year examining and improving the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill before it was passed in July. The Act creates the legal framework and sets out the actions that must be taken to ensure we deliver on our commitments to reduce total carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The Oireachtas has done its part and passed the legislation. The challenge now is to make progress on implementing the legislation to ensure Ireland meets its international and moral commitments under the Paris Agreement. To achieve our 2030 targets, we need to move quickly and take steps now. I would like to see a greater sense of urgency, particularly on larger projects. I accept that the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the implementation of a range of initiatives but efforts must be redoubled because the clock is ticking. Last year, during a debate with the Minister, I called for public transport projects such as MetroLink, DART+ and Luas upgrades to be fast-tracked. It was disappointing to hear comments this week about potential delays. People accept there will always be issues with large-scale infrastructure projects but to suggest that they could be delayed until 2032 or 2034 is not good enough. The Minister needs to take a far more hands-on approach, particularly on public transport. Agencies will follow his lead and there must be a far greater sense of urgency from the top. Equally, we need to see progress on the BusConnects project, which involves the redesign of the Dublin Bus network. We were promised new bus routes and higher frequencies and there is an urgent need for these to be delivered. However, even if we achieve our 2030 and 2050 targets, a large element of climate change is locked in. We must plan to take measures to mitigate the impact and safeguard our people and our national infrastructure. The Minister will know I have expressed concerns about the impact of the forecasted rise in sea levels on the DART line. We have seen the DART out of service on several occasions in the past few years due to flooding and this is set to increase. Urgent action is required. We need an integrated national plan for flood prevention around Dublin Bay from Sandymount in the Minister’s own constituency of Dublin Bay South, through Booterstown, Blackrock, Monkstown and Seapoint to Dún Laoghaire Harbour and even further south from there. This section of the coast is extremely vulnerable. As part of any flood prevention measures, we should use the opportunity to complete the Sutton to Sandycove coastal promenade and cycleway, known as S2S. This project would open up our wonderful coastline to everyone while also protecting homes and safeguarding the DART line. This is nothing new; the project has been in the pipeline for over 30 years. In fact, the himself was one of the original champions of the cause and I hope he will include this project in the revised national development plan next week.  I welcome the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on the circular economy. This must be accompanied by concrete measures to support the sector and consumers. Reducing VAT and other taxes for this sector in budget 2022 would be an encouraging start. Equally, the Government must do more to support energy microgeneration. At the very least, every new school, Garda station and public building should have a microgeneration facility but I want to see this go much further. When will we see a plan to allow microgeneration operators to access the national grid? Points about solar panels and other measures on farms in Europe were well made by Deputy Cahill earlier and we need to see action on this front too. I am very concerned about the impact the crisis in the forestry sector will have on our ability to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets. We urgently need a national plan to get the sector back on track and encourage farmers to plant trees. On housing, we must move quickly to retrofit homes. A commitment has been made to retrofit almost 500,000 homes but we need to see tangible measures in budget 2022 on this front. The Minister’s announcement on the allocation of €57 million for community energy projects is very welcome and we need to see more action in this area. Fuel poverty is a real issue for too many families, particularly those on low incomes and the elderly. The recent increase in energy costs will create hardship for many families this winter and we need to see significant action in the budget to help these families. We also need to consider ramping up innovative solutions, such as the initiative being provided by companies like EnergyCloud which uses surplus wind power to store energy by heating water in homes, thus helping to reduce fuel poverty.  It is clear, having listened to Deputies across the House, that there is great support for the implementation of the climate action plan, for retrofitting homes, facilitating microgeneration and improving public transport, particularly MetroLink, light rail, BusConnects, and coastal and inland cycleways like the aforementioned S2S. I hope the Minister will take this sense of urgency on board ahead of the national development plan and budget 2022 being finalised.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I believe it is safe to say that everyone across Ireland is eager for the further easing of restrictions on Friday, 22 October. While the Government is pressing ahead and making every effort possible to encourage and restore the night-time economy, workers and customers will need access to public transport to get home after midnight. Will the Minister provide an update to the House on the roll-out of 24-hour bus services, particularly here in Dublin, and on the resumption of the Nitelink services across the capital?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move:That, pursuant to Standing Order 198, the Registration of Wills Bill 2016 [Seanad], which lapsed on the dissolution of the 32nd Dáil, shall be restored to the Order Paper at Second Stage.I rise to restore this important and eagerly awaited Bill, which has been in gestation since 2005. In restoring the Registration of Wills Bill 2016, I commend and thank former Senator Terry Leyden for all his hard work in trying to seek to get this Bill passed over the past 16 years. The Registration of Wills Bill 2016 passed all Stages in the Seanad during the previous term, with the support of my colleagues, Senators Clifford-Lee and Catherine Ardagh. The Bill tries to extend the civil registration to ensure that wills created are not lost and are easily accessible. Approximately 30,000 people die each year in Ireland and only 10,000 of their estates go to probate. This is an important Bill, and I ask the House to support it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will ask this question on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Niamh Smyth. What plans exist to encourage diversity within the arts? I believe it is fair to say that all of us in this Chamber have missed the arts over the past 18 months. The artists were creative in every way they could be to try to engage with the public, however, be it virtually or otherwise. I commend the support of the Department but I would like to hear the Minister's plans.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I agree that diversity is very important. For too many communities, the arts are on the periphery rather than a core part of those communities. Diversity and inclusion should be the core values for how we view and support our arts. Diversity is important across arts practice in how artists make work and how people experience it. Importantly, support for cultural diversity within the arts sector will allow us to build and reflect an inclusive and diverse society. We need to open our cultural life to all communities and remove the barriers in place to ensure equal and active contribution, participation and enjoyment of the arts and culture for everybody. I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to support, through a consultative process, community groups, arts groups, cultural bodies, sports clubs, voluntary organisations and charities to recover and enhance their impact after Covid-19. We need make sure that the diverse voices are heard, welcomed and integrated into the arts community as part of this process. I welcome what the Minister said with regard to the Arts Council of Ireland and Screen Ireland. I have two questions for her, however. What are the specific measures and plans to encourage diversity within the arts, particularly for people with disabilities or older people? RTÉ recently broadcast a segment on the Lough Ree Access For All boat, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar. Does she agree that more innovative programmes are needed to open access to the arts? What plans and measures are in place to ensure the voices of those impacted are heard as part of the consultative process?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There are wonderful programmes at work. We have seen the arts sector respond very creatively to presenting its programmes, be it virtually or otherwise. All of those programmes are extremely well received and vital to those communities, but the Minister should also look to those communities impacted long before we even heard of Covid, communities in disadvantaged areas. I am familiar with a number of programmes which have been run on shoestrings that did not or need not apply to the Arts Council for funding. One should try to be as broad and diverse as possible, in terms of new and existing communities. It is very important everyone experiences the arts, regardless of their backgrounds or status.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Niamh Smyth, I ask the Minister to outline the measures that place arts at the centre of local communities, with specific reference to children.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We know the arts play a crucial role in bringing communities and people together. We need an arts strategy that reaches into every corner of the country and, indeed, society. Planning and providing for the arts within the local communities for children is a vital part of building a strong and vibrant community. Strong supports for the arts at local community centres will create a space for communities to express themselves and for talented artists to thrive. We have seen great success with the Creative Youth programme and Cruinniú na nÓg, as referred to by the Minister. There is an explicit commitment to enable children's participation in cultural life and the arts in Ireland through initiatives such as Making Great Art Work, which is the Arts Council strategy for 2016 to 2025.As noted by Professor Emer Smyth of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in her review of this topic for the Arts Council, "Children and young people’s experience of the arts and culture is clearly impacted by their parents and by a range of personal circumstances", as well by decisions "made in the public realm" on their behalf. These include, "the quality of their early childhood care and education, their school experiences, and the availability and accessibility of cultural activities after school".
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister. I am glad that we had this engagement because that is welcome news. It ties in nicely with what we were talking about previously. The programme for Government outlines a vision for Ireland where people of all ages and the arts and culture thrive. We must ensure that children are given every opportunity to express themselves, to take part in the activities of their communities and to reach their full potential. I note what the Minister said about Cruinniú na nÓg and the 630 events in that context. I commend the local authorities for their engagement with this programme and its roll-out. The promotion of the programme was excellent, given everything that was going on then. I have two other questions on this topic. What are the Minister's plans to ensure that all parts of our communities have access to artistic facilities in their local areas, and for our children in particular? How can we ensure that the voices of children are best heard and that their needs are best met as part of the delivery of arts services in their local communities?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for taking our debate this evening. It is important, for both Deputy McAuliffe and me, to speak about public transport in Dublin. Last year, during a debate with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, I called for public transport projects such as the MetroLink, the DART+ and Luas upgrades to be fast-tracked to deal with future demand and to give Dubliners an alternative to their car. While I welcome these critical projects being included in the national development plan, NDP, it was disappointing not to see concrete timelines. Ultimately, agencies and officials take their lead from the top. I would like to see a more urgent hands-on approach to this particular issue. We need to be more ambitious when it comes to large-scale capital projects. My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, will deal with the MetroLink and Luas upgrades in more detail and I will focus my remarks on the NDP commitments and DART+.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I got the timing wrong.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought I had gone over my time.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If I could finish my point on the DART underground, I was about to commend the fact that 41 new DART carriages are on the way, which is welcome. A transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is under way. This would deal with the initial planning and design stages for the rail projects, such as the DART underground.The DART underground has been on the cards since 1972 despite a reported €45 million being invested in planning and design. The DART underground is the missing link between Heuston and Pearse stations. It is seen as the Holy Grail of the integration of the DART network. As such, the DART underground is important for the city.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for that update. BusConnects and everything else seems to be on track in terms of everything we were told this year and late last year. That is welcome, as is the application to An Bord Pleanála. Regarding active travel, some fantastic initiatives have been undertaken across Dublin. However, a key element is the coastal Sutton-Sandyford route, which has been part of the plans for more than 30 years. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is aware of the project. On-roading now appears to be the solution. We will need coastal defences across Dublin and we should at least consider putting cycling or walking facilities on those defences. It is important that the Minister of State is present. On Friday, 22 October, our night-time economy will be open once again. We need a Nitelink service for all of Dublin from 22 October, not just the end of November.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss budget 2022. The underlying macroeconomic forecast for next year is positive and the outlook strong. The State expects to take in approximately €94 billion in revenue, which has given the Ministers for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform scope to invest an extra €4.7 billion in public services. The Government proposes to focus this extra investment in education, health, childcare services, increases to social protection payments and a modest tax package for workers, all of which are welcome. I particularly welcome the investment secured by the Minister for Education. It includes provision for 350 new teachers, which will see the pupil-teacher ratio reduced to 24:1. Funding to hire an additional 980 special education teachers and 1,165 SNAs will make a real difference to children who need that support. The extra €18 million to support DEIS schools, and €4 million to expand the hot school meals programme, shows the focus of this Government on supporting the most disadvantaged. We have all seen the impact of Covid on hospital waiting lists. I welcome the extra €250 million in funding to deal with that issue. Additional funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund is particularly welcome in this regard. Expanding free GP care to children aged under eight will be welcomed by parents and this measure should be expanded as soon as possible. I welcome the extra funding secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, particularly for mental health provision, and the moneys secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is present, to support disability services. Increases to social protection rates, carer's allowance and pension payments are all welcome. The increase in the fuel allowance is very positive. However, the price of fuel will need to be monitored closely to ensure that payment is sufficient. I would like to an expansion of the fuel allowance scheme, with the introduction of a partial payment for people earning slightly more than the current threshold, particularly pensioners with a modest occupational pension who live alone. Young people will benefit from the 50% discount on public transport, increased SUSI grants and changes to health treatment benefits. The increase in the minimum wage is welcome. I also commend the investment in childcare, as highlighted by my colleagues, Deputy Lahart and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne. The continued investment in the Housing for All programme is welcome. Next year, the State will deliver almost 50% of all new housing, including 9,000 new social homes. Funding for 11,000 grants to adapt homes for older people and people with disabilities is an important commitment in the budget. It was clear that the vacant site levy was not working. The new zoned property tax, which will be administered and collected by Revenue rather than local authorities, is an important change. I expect it will have a significant impact. A rate of 3% is a good start but it will need to be ramped up if people and organisations are sitting on valuable serviced sites. In a context were we have seen an increase in antisocial and criminal behaviour in Dublin, funding for an additional 800 gardaí and 400 civilian staff is particularly welcome. I also commend the €5.2 million in funding for victims, including vulnerable witnesses, and to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.The tax package for working people is welcome. A €50 increase in tax credits and changes to the tax bands will mean someone on the average industrial wage is €500 better off. Increases in the working from home tax deductions will assist people with the cost of energy and broadband. Should the economic environment continue to improve, I would like this project expanded next year. Ireland has faced extraordinary challenges over the past 18 months, yet this budget has still delivered the largest welfare package in years. This includes unprecedented investment in health, housing, education, childcare and justice, while also delivering a modest tax change.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move:"That, pursuant to Standing Order 198, the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2018, which lapsed on the dissolution of the 32nd Dáil,shall be restored to the Order Paper at Order for Committee Stage."This Bill seeks to regulate and restrict, where appropriate, convicted sex offenders from travelling abroad in the interests of the common good to protect people outside the State from serious harm. It seeks to amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001 and to provide for related matters. First, I want to acknowledge the efforts of former Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who introduced this Bill in 2018. I would also like to thank and acknowledge the work of Fr. Shay Cullen and Gráinne Kenny of PREDA Foundation for their support of this Bill. Fr. Shay has a distinguished record of working with women and children in the Philippines to protect them from sex slavery and exploitation. As he is a native of my own constituency, I bestowed a civic award on him for his work in the Philippines in 2017. I also thank and acknowledge the great work of Gráinne Kenny, who is also from my constituency, for her active work, support and encouragement on this Bill. Gráinne is a board member of the PREDA Foundation. She has worked with communities and internationally for decades to counter the impact of drugs and exploitation of women and children. It is fitting that this Bill is restored today after the annual EU anti-trafficking day yesterday. This Bill will give judges powers to restrict foreign travel entirely or to require an application to be made to the court for permission to travel. Currently, sex offenders must notify the Garda if they intend to travel outside the jurisdiction for more than seven days.This works well where there is good co-operation between police forces and high child protection standards, such as, for example, in the North, the UK or across the EU. Issues arise where countries do not have high child protection standards. I understand Australia has introduced similar legislation. I thank my colleagues, Deputies Niamh Smyth and Lawless, for their support for the Bill, as well as Senator Gallagher. I look forward to working with colleagues to get the legislation passed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for her attendance and for her opening remarks on breast cancer awareness month. I welcome the opportunity for all the Deputies in the House to join with many other colleagues to discuss this very important issue. Breast cancer remains one of the most common causes of invasive cancer in women in Ireland, after lung cancer, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among women. It is estimated that approximately a quarter of breast cancers may be preventable through modifiable risk and environmental factors. The first line of defence against most disease, including cancer, is prevention through a healthy lifestyle. Breast cancer awareness is an important tool in the early detection of cancer. The focus that breast cancer awareness places on this is very welcome. Approximately 3,500 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year and the National Cancer Registry predicts that it will rise to 4,650 by 2045. One woman in seven in Ireland will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. For each of these women, her diagnosis brings with it a worrying and uncertain time for her and her family.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, again, for the earlier update, including that the national screening service and the HSE have an extensive media campaign planned to highlight key details about screening during Covid-19, breast cancer prevention and symptom awareness.  Breast screening is one of the key strategic tools we have and breast cancer was the first of the cancer services to be centralised by the national cancer control programme when it was established. Breast screening provides an opportunity to detect breast cancer at an early stage and thereby diagnosing mortality and stage of disease at diagnosis. Screening targets those people most at risk of disease based on best scientific evidence and international expertise. BreastCheck invites well people for screening, which is a non-urgent service. Each year, approximately one third of all cancers diagnosed in Ireland are detected through BreastCheck.  I recall when I was a member of the regional health authority that there was a concern in BreastCheck that people who were being invited were not showing up to their screening. I use this opportunity today to say to women that if they are being invited, they should please use that invitation because it is important.  BreastCheck, along with the other cancer screening programmes, was temporarily paused last year due to the impact of the pandemic. The capacity of BreastCheck was also impacted by the cyberattack on the HSE. The programme has done a significant amount of work to support the safe resumption of breast screening and the focus of resumption includes the management of capacity across the whole of the screening pathways, which includes a follow-up assessment and treatments. Routine screening appointments are now returning to normal with approximately 59,000 women being screened between January and July this year. The programme exceeded the target of 49,000 women and more than 10,000 participants were screened in August alone, which is very welcome. However, as Professor Flanagan, BreastCheck’s lead clinician, told the Oireachtas Committee on Health, interruptions caused to the screening programme by Covid-19 may result in some cancers going undetected. I reiterate it is critical that women take up their appointments. I welcome the expansion of the screening that is included in the programme for Government that will see all women aged 50 to 69 years of age invited for routine screening. This and other commitments in the programme for Government to improve health services for women and the general population are very welcome.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the introduction of the Child and Family Agency (Amendment) Bill 2021. The purpose of the Bill is to give full effect to the Taoiseach's announcement on 27 June 2020 that oversight of certain education and welfare functions would return to the Department of Education. Those functions, namely, the functions vested in the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or under the Education Welfare Act 2000 and the administrative functions in respect of the administration of the home liaison scheme and the school completion programme, were transferred to the Minister for Education by the transfer of functions under SI 588 of 2020 with effect from 1 January 2021.Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is responsible for the delivery of these services under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, through the Tusla education support services, TESS, and the alternative education assessment and registration service, AEARS. The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 currently provides for the governance and oversight of Tusla by the Minister for Children, in respect of all Tusla functions. The proposed Bill will amend the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 to provide the Minister for Education with the appropriate governance and statutory oversight in respect of education welfare functions exercised by the Child and Family Agency. It will provide the Minister for Education with appropriate powers to provide policy guidance, direction and prioritisation parameters for Tusla in respect of education welfare matters. From 2021 onward, the funding for the education welfare functions performed by the Child and Family Agency is to be provided by the Minister for Education, all of which is welcome. As noted, the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 provides for the governance and oversight of Tusla by the Minister for Children. This is also a good opportunity to consider how Tusla is working and serving the needs of Ireland's most vulnerable and families. Coincidently, the CEO of Tusla was with us at the Committee of Public Accounts this morning. One aspect that stuck out was the very high rate of turnover in frontline staff. The Minister is familiar with that. We have some 500 social workers currently in Dublin and it seems 100 of those, or about 20%, are new recruits. This very high level of turnover raises questions about the culture, management and resources within the organisation. I have no doubt that the people joining the organisation are committed to their role and do good work, but I cannot help but wonder if they are being let down by the system as a whole. In our engagement this morning, in fairness, the CEO of Tusla committed to looking at different aspects of how the organisation responds to service users. This is crucial. Given the feedback that I and other Deputies have received, certainly over the past months in this House and particularly in the height of the pandemic and during the post-pandemic period, there is big room for improvement. Are there sufficient senior social workers available to supervise and support those new staff, that 20% of new recruits I spoke of? Within An Garda Síochána, a sergeant and experienced gardaí are always on hand to support new recruits, as they usually work in pairs in the community. I do not expect the Minister to reply on this matter today but it would be good to see some comparative statistics published, and perhaps the Minister can ask his officials to review the recruitment and retention issue and send on the information if possible. Ultimately, it is the children and families who suffer where there are insufficient social workers, or where there is a high turnover of social workers. I am personally aware of one case where a vulnerable mother is currently on her third social worker in nine weeks and has been unable to see her children in that time. She has had to retell her story of domestic abuse each time to each social worker, while wondering if she will be believed. This is simply not good practice. She has struggled to send information to Tusla as the social workers will not provide email addresses, and in one case told her no mobile number was available. This is actually contrary to what we heard from the CEO this morning at the committee, whereby every single member of front-line staff has a mobile phone. If the State is paying for that then surely there must be a better form of communication. I am happy to send on the information to the Minister, but I would be worried if this was happening on a wider scale than that. We were also told at the committee today that social workers are not even provided with business cards by the agency. It was as if this was a revelation to the CEO. I am aware that he has only been in the role for 24 months, but this needs to change. I do not believe that such a small operational issue should need to be raised on the floor of the House, but such is the importance and simplicity of that request I feel I have to do so. I would also like to raise the lack of family support workers in Dublin to supervise court ordered access visits. The service is under the Department of Justice via the Courts Service. These are important to de-dramatise court ordered visits and I would like to see them introduced in Dublin. I ask the Minister to raise this with his colleagues. I would like to see more information about the research being carried out by Tusla on the outcomes of cases across various socio-economic communities to ensure equality of treatment for all children. Can copies of the reports be forwarded to the committee and if not why not?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know it is not the Minister's remit, but he will be aware of recent reports of antisocial and criminal behaviour on our public transport services, be they Luas, DART or bus services throughout the greater Dublin area. Only yesterday, in the Irish Independent, Allison Bray reported on antisocial behaviour and harassment that seems to have become endemic on services. The response from Irish Rail security was that nothing can be done and they see it every day. That is an appalling indictment of our public transport services. Passengers and staff deserve to be safe on these services. When will the Government introduce a dedicated Garda transport unit?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, on his remarks on the Bill, including the assumption of the challenges not only facing us here in Ireland but right across Europe. A higher level must be achieved. I thank the Minister of State for his attendance throughout this discussion this afternoon of this important Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill 2021. I support this Bill, which provides for the implementation of three international legal instruments in the area of people smuggling. These three instruments are aimed at providing an effective international response to the growing problem of people smuggling. Under these instruments, any person who deliberately assists unauthorised entry, transit or residence of a non-EU national in the EU is to be sanctioned unless doing so for humanitarian reasons. It is an important point that the Minister of State made in his opening remarks that there is a safeguard for those who are undertaking that extraordinary work. As noted, people smuggling differs from human trafficking in that trafficking is carried out for the explicit purpose of exploitation and need not necessarily involve illegal entry into a state. People smuggling is not defined in terms of exploitation but the process of people smuggling typically involves serious exploitation, suffering and a risk of physical harm and death. People smuggling frequently involves the imposition of extortionate fees by smugglers, as we heard, as well as exposing the illegal migrants to severe danger in clandestinely entering states. This was demonstrated by the recent tragedy in Britain where 39 people died in a container in Essex and the Wexford tragedy of December 2001, which happened in the Minister of State's constituency. Those images haunt everybody and serve to highlight the challenges faced by those individuals. As my colleague has said, they have paid to get to where they think their destination will be. Members have noted the high estimates of numbers of people smuggled into the State. As a State we should do more to streamline the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, process and systems to help vulnerable people without papers regularise their position. I highlight the remarks from Deputy Howlin earlier about the need for greater co-operation between the INIS and Deputies from across the House, which were well made. In many cases Members of this House are the last option for those individuals, particularly the most vulnerable people. Agencies should not be using the General Data Protection Regulation and other regulations as a pretext for avoiding transparency and accountability. Personally, I have found INIS officials very helpful but it is clear the office is stretched and requires greater resources and support. Perhaps this is something the Minister of State can raise with colleagues in advance of the next budget. That said, this is very worthwhile and needed legislation. It is important that Europe is working collectively on it. Much more needs to be done. The Minister of State and the Ceann Comhairle are aware that on 19 October I restored the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2018 to the Order Paper. That deals with people leaving this jurisdiction for other reasons but such matters must be viewed in the round. Any effort in this space by the State must be welcomed and we must do more in this space to protect vulnerable individuals. As we have said, they believe they are heading to a better destination or life but are confronted with some pretty horrific reality. They feel they cannot do anything about it. We need to hear more about the Health Service Executive anti-human trafficking team and promote it as our existing services need greater support and promotion. That is so people who feel exploited and vulnerable can report their position and, we hope, get the support and assistance they need and deserve.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the report, Monitoring Adequate Housing in Ireland, and to discuss the significant progress made to date on the serious issues highlighted within it. I note the Minister of State's remarks in that regard. The research, published jointly by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Economic and Social Research Institute, has shown that lone parents and their children account for 53% of homeless families and are much more likely to experience inadequate housing than other household types. The report also highlights the disadvantage experienced by young people, migrants, people with disabilities, Travellers and others in the Irish housing system. While I note the reductions in homelessness in recent months, the recent increase in the homeless figures will be of serious concern to the Government. Significant improvements have been made since homelessness was at its highest two years ago but a huge amount of work remains to be done and we recognise that. Budget 2022 allocated €194 million to homeless services and the Government is committed to ending homelessness by 2030. The Government’s focus on increasing housing supply was evident in budget 2022. Next year, for example, €4 billion of Exchequer funding, supplemented by Land Development Agency funding and Housing Finance Agency lending, will be made available to deliver 9,000 new build social homes and make 4,130 homes available for affordable purchase and cost rental. In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, a significant public housing development has been completed at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside. The scheme includes cost-rental and social housing units. A total of 597 badly needed homes will be constructed at the former Shanganagh Castle site in Shankill. This public housing scheme, which is being developed in partnership between the Land Development Agency and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, will deliver 91 affordable purchase homes, 306 cost-rental units and 200 social homes. Cost-rental homes are a new form of renting and will result in more affordable rents for households which struggle to pay private rents but earn above the threshold for social housing. The new Shanganagh development is currently the country’s largest proposed cost-rental scheme. These new homes will include 51 terraced, semi-detached and detached houses and 546 apartments. They will be a mix of two four-bedroom, 99 three-bedroom, 302 two-bedroom and 165 one-bedroom units and 29 studio apartments. The Minister is committed to progressing this and other badly needed public housing schemes and I look forward to working with him and his officials to increase the supply of public and private housing. I welcome today’s announcement on private rents in Dublin. It will come as a relief to renters. However, there are issues around securing a home to rent. Higher costs remain and will be resolved by an increase in supply. I welcome the measures in Housing for All in this regard, particularly the zoned site tax, which will penalise property owners who sit on zoned serviced land. The report we are discussing, which is welcome, raises the challenges encountered by people with disabilities in securing appropriate accommodation. It found that 29% of persons living with a disability experience housing quality issues, when compared with those without a disability. People with disabilities are also more likely to report an inability to keep their home warm and arrears on rent or mortgage payments. All Members of this House will be aware of the challenges faced by people with disabilities when trying to secure social or private housing. This issue needs to be addressed and I will continue to work on it with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Ministers responsible for disability. Housing policy must address the needs of our society, particularly its most vulnerable members. The restricted options for older people and people with disabilities are among the most pressing issues. I welcome the pathways detailed in the Housing for All strategy to support these vulnerable groups and others. I also welcome the commitment to publishing a new national housing strategy for people with disabilities and I look forward to working with the Minister of State and Members across the House.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing forward this motion. I welcome the opportunity to examine it. I will be supporting the motion which will authorise the Minister for Finance to not allocate €500 million to the rainy day fund for 2021. The action is prudent given the very exceptional circumstances created by the Covid-19 pandemic. A similar motion under section 6 of the National Surplus Act 2019 was proposed last year in the context of the pandemic and in 2019 because of Brexit. Given the international economic environment, returns on investments are minimal and the €500 million will be better spent being invested here in Ireland. That said, the medium-term benefits of building a counter-cyclical fund remain. The macroeconomic outlook for next year is very positive and in those circumstances I would like to see the payments resume in the future. It is important we prudently set aside funds during the good times for future challenges. We have mentioned challenge of Brexit. Who was to know that something would surpass Brexit? It was the issue of the time, and remains a significant challenge for this country, but then along came the pandemic and really put us to the test. However, the Government moved quickly, and rightly so, at the outset of the pandemic to provide funds. The Minister of State said it required €48 billion to deal with the pandemic and to fund front-line Departments, local authorities and agencies to ensure the continuity of public services, protect incomes and re-imagine the public realm. The work of officials and staff at the Department of Social Protection in particular should be noted. They reacted overnight, ensuring more than half a million workers had access to pandemic unemployment payment. I also want to acknowledge the actions of Revenue in dealing with companies and all their queries about employees and themselves.The response of the Revenue Commissioners was exemplary, especially in the early and middle parts of last year, and should be acknowledged. Local authorities also moved quickly to improve the public realm, installing public toilets, bins, outdoor seating, etc., and providing all sorts of other services. I encourage local authorities to retain improvements that have worked and engage in meaningful public consultation, which is key in this regard. However, now the acute phase of the pandemic has passed - I hope it is behind us - it is important we resume normal procurement practices to ensure taxpayers' money is spent prudently. This is particularly important given the increase in costs for construction projects and services. I join the Minister of State in expressing condolences to those who passed away during the pandemic. This is not all about money. This is about the impact it has had on society, families, workers and businesses across the country. We must remember that when we are discussing finance in this House. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their attendance today and for their assistance over the past 20 months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I ask the Minister for Finance to outline the ways in which the Government is supporting the credit union sector to continue to provide essential financial services to local communities.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for that reply and for his engagement, particularly on the review. I note that €1.1 billion being lent for SMEs and mortgages. Will he please update the House on the three commitments contained within the programme for Government, one of which is the status of the review with the policy framework with the credit unions and how they are operating? What action is being taken to enable and support the credit union movement to grow? I also note the 18% increase in the loan book. How are he and his Department supporting credit unions in expanding their services to encourage community development? Finally, I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on these commitments, either to the House this evening or in written form.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister of State mentioned the credit unions’ willingness to step in, particularly given the closure of bank branches throughout the country. There have been a number of high-profile branch closures, including in my constituency and in Dublin city. Only last week, Shankill in my constituency lost its ATM. Some Deputies might say that that is not the end of the world. However, it is for a community that relies on that ATM to access services. I also commend Core Credit Union for its proactive nature in expanding its services. That is exactly what the credit unions want to do. They want to expand services, such as loans, savings, current accounts, debit cards, apps, online banking and so on. With the right support from Government and from the Central Bank of Ireland, credit unions say that they can continue to be present in towns and villages, which is important. I acknowledge what the Minister of State is saying about that. The Minister of State might please keep in contact with me about that engagement, to ensure that once the review is complete we know exactly where we are.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On behalf of Deputy Crowe, I ask the Minister for Finance his plans to enhance the NCID, in relation to insurance.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is welcome news. I welcome the proposed extension of the national claims information database. I note that last week, at an Oireachtas committee, Oliver Gilvarry, head of the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council secretariat made the point that enhancements to the NCID database would provide greater detail on claims which would help to drill down on the cost of the awards. I note what the Minister of State has said about the volume of information available here compared with other jurisdictions, especially the breakdown between awards and legal costs. We have seen with the database that the more information that comes through, the more information policy makers have to move forward and identify what changes need to be made. Is it the intention to make sure that more data are provided?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State. It is certainly good information for consumers. The first Central Bank report on the national claims information database was published more than a year ago. It identified that in reality, the award to the individual, whether through PIAB or the courts, was pretty much the same. Coming back to the database, that is why, according to the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, it is so important to see the information flow so that the industry can be challenged about why prices are not falling. When can we expect to see the changes take effect? What impact does the Minister of State anticipate it will have on the cost of insurance overall?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I extend my sympathy to the family of Austin Currie, including Senator Emer Currie. I also extend my sympathy to his party colleagues and wide circle of friends. He was a distinguished human rights campaigner, co-founder of the SDLP and a former member of this House from 1989 to 2002, serving as Minister of State with responsibility for children from 1994 to 1997. Prior to his election to this House, he was elected as a Nationalist Party MP to the Northern Parliament at Stormont, representing the constituency of East Tyrone from 1964 to 1972, until that body was abolished, and direct rule reintroduced after Bloody Sunday. My family hail from Coalisland, County Tyrone, and his efforts on behalf of constituents there are still remembered to this day. I will turn to the Bill before the House, the Finance (European Stability Mechanism and Single Resolution Fund) Bill 2021, which ratifies amending agreements to the ESM and the SRF intergovernmental agreement, IGA. As noted, the reform of the ESM treaty, signed in January, is a crucial stepping stone on the path to reinforce economic and monetary union and is a significant accompaniment to our efforts in supporting economic recovery. It will help to boost confidence in the euro area's ability to quash crises before they escalate. All euro area member states are required to ratify both amending agreements in order to implement the Eurogroup agreement from November 2020, in relation to ESM treaty reform and the introduction of the common backstop to the SRF, two years ahead of schedule. The Eurogroup agreement addresses a crucial gap in the banking union by empowering the ESM to act as the common backstop to the SRF, from January 2022. In addition, the agreement further develops the ESM's precautionary financial assistance instruments and improves the operational effectiveness of the institution. As the Minister of State highlighted, euro area member states have committed to completing their respective national ratification procedures by the end of 2021 to enable the amending agreements to the ESM treaty and the SRF intergovernmental agreement to enter into force at the beginning of next year. It is a largely technical amendment and many of the changes and reforms are welcome, moving from a situation where states that need to access ESM support agree to a memorandum of understanding to a state-prepared proposal. I note some Members of this House dismiss the legislation as having no impact on Ireland. This misses the point. The European project is about more than one state, it is about EU solidarity and all of us working together with other EU states to make the Union stronger. The Bill strengthens the stability of the eurozone and ultimately the EU. This stability underpins the Irish economic model and ultimately Irish jobs, so we can see it has a critical impact on Ireland and our people. I hope Members from across the House will support the Bill. I welcome that the last few Members spoke in favour of it. I hope there will be full support for the Bill across the House and that when it comes to the final Stages, Members will see fit to vote for it and we will see unanimous support for the Bill.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand that 450 new staff will be employed in the Passport Office. I acknowledge the work of the staff in that office. It has been an extremely busy time for them, particularly in the last number of months. Some were re-tasked to assist the Department of Social Protection and other Departments during the height of the pandemic. I am sure I speak for all Deputies when I express gratitude for the work they have done and for assisting many members of the public. The Minister will be aware of the backlog of paper-based applications and of more complex applications. Indeed, there is a heap of applications by parents for children's first passports that need to be dealt with.When does the Minister expect those new staff to come on stream? How long will it take to process the backlog, particularly, of paper-based applications? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is important that this House discuss the findings of the Farrelly commission's inquiry into the Grace case. Grace was failed by the State and her service providers. Concerns were raised as far back as 1993. Grace and her family deserve the truth and the establishment of the full facts of the case. The commission, under chairperson and sole member Marjorie Farrelly, SC, commenced its investigation on 15 May 2017. Four years on, it is regrettable that we do not have a final report. My colleague, Deputy McGuinness, has consistently raised this in the House. I commend him on his tenacity in this regard. It is important for this House to see the final report. Under the terms of reference, as approved by the Government in March 2017, a final report on the commission's phase 1 work into Grace's case was due to be submitted to the Minister for Health within one year of the commission commencing its work. The commission has received a number of time extensions to enable it to carry out its work in accordance with the terms of reference. The pandemic will have had an impact on the work of the commission. That is understandable. In the circumstances, I support the extension for another 12 months so the commission may continue with its work but I would like to see the final report on Grace's case. The interim findings of the commission are a matter of deep concern as it is clear that, at the time in question, the South-Eastern Health Board, and subsequently the HSE, failed to adhere to their statutory obligations. These reports point to a series of historic systemic failings on the part of the various public bodies. It should be acknowledged that the national policy on the care of children and adults with intellectual disabilities has developed significantly since the periods covered by the reports, including through the establishment of the national safeguarding policy and the safeguarding committee in each of the community healthcare organisations, the appointment of a confidential recipient, and the establishment of a national independent review panel. However, as we have seen in the Brandon report, Grace's case may not be an isolated incident. There may be more systemic failures. The needs of service users must be prioritised, and lessons must be learned. A start would be the full publication of the Brandon report, as called for by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on several occasions. Last month, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State responsible for disabilities published two substantive interim reports of the commission of investigation. The first covers the period from 1989 to 1996, when Grace reached adulthood. It covers the role of public authorities in her care and protection and the arrangements whereby her foster home was identified. The second report covers the period from 1997 to 2007. The commission has found that there were repeated and systemic failings in the management of the care of Grace, an intellectually disabled woman left in foster care for two decades despite concerns about physical and sexual abuse. As an infant, Grace was given into the voluntary care of the State. She lived in several residential and foster home settings within the Eastern Health Board area up to the age of 11. She was then placed in the foster care of family X by the South-Eastern Health Board in February 1989. This was in a home in the south east. She lived with family X into adulthood, or until she was nearly 31 years of age, which was almost for 20 years. The commission found that Grace was placed in foster care along with other vulnerable adults and children despite her foster parents – identified only as "Mr. and Mrs. X" – having criminal convictions. The investigation could not conclude whether Mr. X's convictions for larceny and theft, dating from 1966, and Mrs X's convictions for larceny in 1988 would have prevented them from being approved as foster parents for Grace in 1989, "but considers that it is unlikely to have done so". This is extraordinary. The HSE was unable to tell the commission whether there was a policy within the South-Eastern Health Board in or around 1989 that would have prohibited children from being placed in the care of individuals against whom there were criminal convictions. Grace remained in the family's care until 2009 despite allegations of abuse. The commission found that, in the care and decision-making in Grace's case from 1997 to 2006, there were:– [an] ongoing lack of clarity about Grace's legal status as a vulnerable adult; – misconceptions about the role and legal status of Mrs. and Mr. X and Grace's mother with respect to decision making for Grace; – ongoing confusion/misunderstanding about what had occurred in Grace's case in 1996; – ongoing failure to seek legal advice or to follow through on the issue of wardship; – inconsistent approach to monitoring; – failures in information sharing and working with incomplete information; – absence of proper supervision and oversight; – paralysis around interconnection between care decisions and legal considerations; – lack of co-ordination and follow through; and – delay, indecision and U-turns.Failings in Grace's care and overarching systemic issues affecting her case "resulted in her case disappearing from view within the health board" from when she was 18 until she was 28. That sends a chill down our spines and those of parents or others who look to the State for care. We saw a programme some days ago on historical failings in this State but the case we are talking about arose during my lifetime, not decades ago. The commission stated that the reactive, rather than proactive, manner in which the disability service operated, together with the absence of oversight and regular file reviews, "contributed to Grace's case falling through the cracks and out of sight in 2001". The commission has found that the South-Eastern Health Board and its officials were the decision-makers. It is clear they failed in their responsibility to Grace, and possibly other vulnerable individuals under their care. Grace has been failed by the South-Eastern Health Board and State. She and her family must receive justice. Lessons must be learned and all vulnerable people must be protected in the future. I look forward to examining the final report of the commission.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021, a wide-ranging Bill that seeks to regulate e-scooters, e-bikes and the newly installed dynamic traffic management system on the M50. The Bill also includes measures to increase the speed of the implementation of BusConnects and underpins the investment in a much-improved public transport system. Significantly, the Bill also introduces legislation to deal with dangerous and antisocial off-road use of scramblers, quads and similar vehicles. There are amendments to strengthen laws concerning insurance and road traffic law enforcement. These measures will help to improve road safety while helping us to drive down the cost of insurance for law-abiding drivers. These initiatives will help us to advance towards our ambitious shared EU Vision Zero objective of eliminating deaths and serious injuries on our roads by 2050. While I generally welcome the Bill as part of the Government's efforts to introduce and encourage alternative modes of mobility, give people more options and reduce our reliance on cars, I believe there are issues with it. I hope the Minister will be open to amendments on Committee Stage. I will deal with each of the principal aspects of the Bill in turn. Currently, both e-bikes and e-scooters come under the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle, MPV. A person driving or riding an MPV must have insurance, tax and a licence. This has caused confusion as there is no specific licence available for an e-scooter or e-bike. Section 16(e) of this Bill amends the 1961 Act and defines a new category of vehicle, the powered personal transporter, PPT, and sets out certain technical details characterising such vehicles. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states, "This vehicle category is intended to encompass a range of small, lightweight micro-mobility vehicles such as e-scooters, electric skateboards, segways, hoverboards, etc. which are not accurately captured within the vehicle categories as set out in the 1961 Act due to technological innovations in the intervening years." Section 16(b)(ii) amends the Road Traffic Act 1961 to exempt PPTs from the definition of an MPV. This means there will be legal clarity meaning PPTs such as e-scooters and e-bikes can be used without the need for registration, tax, licensing and insurance conditions, as are necessary for MPVs. Part 12 also defines an e-bike for the first time in Irish legislation and differentiates between low-powered and high-powered models. Many of the amendments in Part 12 are technical and add the term PPT or PPTs to existing legislation. While e-bikes and e-scooters will not be treated as MPVs, there is still legislation that prohibits drink driving on a bike and speeding and this will extend to PPTs. The Bill clarifies that PPTs are also required to be roadworthy and may be examined by a garda to ensure they do not have a dangerous defect. It will be an offence to supply a powered personal transporter to a person under the age of 16 years. This is somewhat problematic. I hope consideration will be given to reducing the age, perhaps for low-powered PPTs, or restricted-speed models, to allow children over 12 – basically all secondary school children – to use an e-bike to get around. E-bikes are popular in that age category in secondary schools. Section 109A will give the Garda significant powers to crack down on antisocial and reckless criminal behaviour of those using scramblers and quad bikes. Provisional RSA statistics show that, in the period 2014 to 2019, three of the six people who died in Ireland as a result of an incident involving a quad bike or scrambler were aged 18 or under. The RSA statistics also show that, between 2014 and 2019, 60 people were injured in collisions involving a quad bike or scrambler on a public road. Of those killed or injured, 41% were 18 years of age or under. My Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, has already dealt with this issue in detail so I do not propose to repeat what was said other than to compliment him and my colleague, Deputy Lahart, for championing this issue in the House.  The new measures will empower gardaí to enter the curtilage of a dwelling, but not a dwelling itself, to seize and remove scramblers used for antisocial activity. This is particularly welcome. Part 4 of the Bill introduces amendments concerning the information that motor insurers must provide to the Motor Insurance Bureau Ireland and the use of this information. Section 56 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 stipulates that every person using an MPV in a public area must have an approved motor insurance policy. This Bill will ensure insurance companies will have to provide details to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland within five working days. This will be useful for gardaí. It should enhance enforcement and drive down the cost of motor insurance for responsible drivers. I note improvements to fixed-charge penalties included in Part 7 of the Bill, which amends the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975 and will treat fixed-charge notices issued by traffic wardens in the same way as those issued by An Garda under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010. This means a person will have another opportunity to pay a fixed penalty, at the point of summons, before the case goes to court for offences specified in the section, such as parking offences. That is particularly welcome because cases in this regard are clogging up our courts. I would say the vast majority of the cases before the District Court concern road traffic offences. The Bill introduces provisions to deal with variable speed limits on the M50, in addition to technical amendments on novice drivers and driving instructors. All are welcome. I hope the Minister will have regard to my suggestion to allow all second level students to use e-bikes and consider points raised by Deputies on e-scooters to ensure there is not a free-for-all. Concern in this regard was the main deterrent to introducing legislation. It might be useful if the committee hears from experts in this area to reach a cross-party consensus. Disability advocates and groups representing older people, for example, have concerns, and they need to be heard. I hope we can amend the existing legislation. I hope we can make progress on this Bill because its provisions are certainly demanded and needed. We need regulation, but the vehicles in question are very popular and people want to see them introduced on our roads.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would like an update from the Minister with regard to his recent visit to Lithuania where, I understand, discussions around rule of law and issues pertaining to Hungary, Poland and Belarus took place.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for that update. He mentioned a visit to the Belarusian border. I note the remarks made earlier by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, Deputies Cowen and Howlin and others in regard to regular migrants who, it is my understanding, are Iraqis. What is the view in Lithuania with regard to Belarus, Russia and other actors within that area? I understand that last Wednesday the Lithuanian Government declared a state of emergency along its borders with Belarus. I understand that 4,200 irregular migrants have crossed into Lithuania at this point. The Minister of State mentioned he visited the migrant camps. Do we know how many are amassing on the border? As stated by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, this is an orchestrated campaign, which is despicable. The Lithuania Minister has been forthright in his remarks about the Lukashenko regime and the criminal measures being taken to create pressure points along the border with Europe in Lithuania, Poland and Latvia.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister of State mentioned the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. I commend its work and swift action on this matter, as well as the Government's contribution to those efforts. It is imperative this House and the Government keep the pressure up, through the European Union and our dialogue with member states and others, to ensure we can resolve this humanitarian crisis that is being orchestrated on the EU's borders. It is a new phenomenon but I fear it will not be the last time we see it. We must be vigilant and respond as best we can in helping the people who are, in effect, pawns in a larger game along the EU border. I thank the Minister of State for his update and his work on the issue to date.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I note today a report in a newspaper regarding the Companies Registration Office, CRO, filing deadline of 25 November and very unsatisfactory responses allegedly being given to those who have sought extensions to that deadline. I ask the Minister to raise with his Cabinet colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the possibility of extending the deadline beyond 25 November. More people will be working from home from now on and will not have the same access to the documents they need. A little bit of latitude, similar to what was shown last year, would be welcome. Effectively, regardless of the date of filing, companies were treated as if they had filed on time. I ask that the same system is put in place this year, given the Covid-related announcements in recent days. This is required and would be very much appreciated by many businesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As this is the European Day for the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, it is appropriate that we are discussing the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2021 today. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing this important legislation to the House. I will be supporting this Bill which includes a number of important amendments to the sex offenders register notification requirements. It also provides for electronic tagging and for a prohibition on convicted sex offenders engaging in certain types of employment. While such bans on working with children or vulnerable people have been made by the courts in the past, the Bill will now provide for an explicit power with regard to prohibition. This Bill will address the concerns of communities around the country about the ongoing management of convicted sex offenders in the community. It introduces stricter notification requirements on offenders, will allow for electronic monitoring in certain circumstances and will explicitly prohibit convicted sex offenders from working with children or vulnerable people. The Bill fulfils commitments in Justice Plan 2021 and in the programme for Government to update the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to ensure convicted sex offenders are effectively managed and monitored. The publication of the Bill is an action in the second national strategy for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The key features in this Bill include a change to require sex offenders moving location to notify authorities within three days rather than seven days. It explicitly provides for the court to prohibit a sex offender from working with children and vulnerable adults. It provides powers to the Garda Síochána to take fingerprints, palm prints and photographs to confirm the identity of the person. It creates a legislative basis for the assessment and management of risk posed by sex offenders across teams involving probation officers, gardaí and Tusla. It allows the Garda Síochána to disclose information relating to persons on the sex offender register, in extenuating circumstances, for example where there is a serious threat to public safety. It allows the Garda Síochána to apply for the discharge or variation of a sex offender order. It also allows, as mentioned, for electronic monitoring of sex offenders to assist in ensuring an offender’s compliance with a sex offender order or post-release supervision order. The latest numbers from An Garda Síochána show there are 1,708 persons currently subject to the reporting requirements of Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. Included in that figure is a total of 319 sex offenders being supervised by the Probation Service currently living in the community. There are 192 such offenders on post-release supervision in the community by the Probation Service. The remainder are notifying at Garda stations. In addition to those currently subject to the reporting requirements, there are 433 people in custody having been convicted of a sex offence since 2001 who will be subject to reporting restrictions on release. The Bill places the current SORAM monitoring process for high-risk offenders on a statutory footing. This is particularly welcome. SORAM involves the joint management of sex offenders by An Garda Síochána and the Probation Service with the involvement of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, where there are child protection concerns and with other agencies where necessary. I hope SORAM can address some of the issues Deputy Naughten just spoke about, especially those relating to the identity and the onus on the sex offender to notify gardaí. Hopefully that is something the Minister of State can take up on Committee Stage when the time comes. SORAM currently operates on a non-statutory basis. The Bill also provides a power to gardaí to disclose information about a sex offender’s previous convictions to a member or members of the public where the offender poses a risk of causing further harm. The purpose of proposals relating to SORAM and the proposals on the disclosure of information relating to sex offenders is specifically to provide a legislative underpinning to the current administrative processes. Many of the provisions in this Bill are welcome. They will update legislation in this area and help to protect women, children and vulnerable people in our community. However, I believe this Bill could go further. I would like to see restrictions on travel abroad, for example. Currently, where there is good co-operation between police forces and there are high child protection standards, such as in Northern Ireland, the UK and across much of Europe, the safeguarding policies work well. Sadly though, this is not the case in many countries such as Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines, to name a few. They are struggling to deal with the issues of sex tourism, trafficking and exploitation, despite the best efforts of many local agencies, campaigners and elected representatives in those jurisdictions. The Minister of State will be aware that last month I reintroduced the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill 2018 which seeks to give courts the option of issuing restrictions on travel when passing sentence. I ask the Minister of State to consider amendments on Committee Stage which might strengthen this Bill and provide for travel restrictions on sex offenders. I believe it is linked to the intention of this Bill and ask the Minister of State and the officials to take that on board and examine the request. I appreciate all the work the Minister of State and the officials have done to progress this legislation. I hope Deputies from right across the House will support this positive legislation which will help to safeguard women, children and vulnerable people in our communities.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish the Ceann Comhairle the very best. I welcome this opportunity to examine the Government's proposed Climate Action Plan 2021. The science on climate change is clear. As temperatures continue to rise, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, with increased risk to global food supplies and security. We now have to act. We can build a greener economy and society which create opportunities for us all. The plan lists actions needed to deliver on our climate targets. It sets indicative ranges of emission reductions for each sector of the economy. I will briefly touch on three aspects in the time available to me. I welcome the Minister of State's comments that a one-stop shop will be established to help people retrofit private homes and that details of suppliers, contractors and finance options will be available. This mirrors a call I made recently in that regard. Perhaps the Minister of State in his closing remarks will provide an update on plans to retrofit council housing stock.As energy prices continue to rise, many people living in council housing will be eager to see the benefits of retrofitting. We need county-by-county targets and detailed timelines so people know where they stand. Perhaps the Minister might also touch on plans to increase afforestation. Ireland currently has one of the lowest levels of forestry in the EU at 11%. That is just ahead of Netherlands on 10% and Malta on just 1%. We need serious ambition in this area to at least double the level of afforestation, which would still leave us at half the EU average of 39%. I also appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to inject a sense of urgency into Government agencies that manage and deliver public transport. We need more urgency around major projects. Many constituents are onto us about retrofitting schemes, particularly the elderly. While the forms are simple and easy to use, and I commend their simplistic nature which will ensure that everybody can avail of them, the Minister will be aware of the timeline and delay associated with these schemes. We need to do more. If people want to work with us to ensure they have warmer homes, we need to do everything we can on the other side to facilitate that as much as possible, be it for public or private homes. There is a great yearning from the public to assist the country in achieving its targets, whether for 2030 or 2050. Many of those targets are ambitious but it is incumbent on all of us to work as clearly and collectively as possible to ensure we reach those targets.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As we approach Christmas, many people are eager to receive their third or booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Announcements from the NIAC around people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions are welcome. Will the Tánaiste advise when the HSE will operationalise this advice? This week the European Medicines Agency recommended that everybody aged 40 and over should be offered a booster as soon as possible. Will the Government write to NIAC seeking urgent consideration of this most important advice? When might people who received the one-shot Janssen vaccination expect to receive their booster?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Bill 2021. I thank the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and his officials for their work on this Bill and for bringing it before the House. I will be supporting this important change in legislation which ends the era of strategic housing developments. This was a key commitment of the programme for Government and I am pleased to see it being implemented by the Minister. I agree with the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach. His own experience in Dublin South-West mirrors my very similar experience in my own constituency in Dún Laoghaire with regard to SHDs. The Bill introduces a new planning process for large-scale residential developments, LRDs, which will replace the existing strategic housing development process. Crucially, the reforms in this Bill will restore the power to make decisions on large-scale residential developments to city or county councils in the first instance, thereby providing greater transparency and clarity and improved public participation in the process. The Bill passed by the Seanad introduces a provision that local authorities must ensure that owner-occupied housing is provided for as a tenure type and that the number of such units is estimated in their housing strategies. Next year, €4 billion of Exchequer funding, supplemented by Land Development Agency funding and Housing Finance Agency lending, will be made available to deliver 9,000 new-build social homes and make 4,130 homes available for affordable purchase and cost rental. The Bill introduces a new planning process for LRDs to replace the SHD process. The SHD process, provided for by the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, allowed for certain large-scale applications to be made directly to An Bord Pleanála. The new process is envisaged to take place at local authority level with a mechanism to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. This is quite similar to the traditional planning process. The introduction of the LRD process gives effect to the commitment in action 12.3 of the Government’s Housing for All strategy. It introduces a three-stage LRD process consisting of a pre-planning phase, an application phase and an appeal phase. The reforms will restore the power to make decisions on large residential developments to local authorities in the first instance, providing greater transparency and clarity and improved public participation in the process, which is crucial. A large-scale residential development is defined as a housing development of 100 or more units, student accommodation comprising 200 units or more, or a combination of the two where the threshold is met for either element. The Bill also contains an amendment to section 50A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, allowing for any party to a planning appeal to apply to have it heard by the Supreme Court under judicial review, bypassing the Court of Appeal stage provided for under the current system. This provision is intended to reduce the length of time it takes to dispose of the litigation and is a welcome change. The Bill will also provide certainty and stability to the construction sector by retaining some of the positive elements of the existing arrangements such as mandatory pre-application consultation, the quality of applications submitted and decision timelines. Delivering on commitments in both the programme for Government and Housing for All, the new LRD arrangements will involve three stages. The pre-application stage involves two steps. The applicant will first be required to seek standard pre-application consultation as currently mandated for developments of this scale under section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The second step entails a mandatory eight-week consultation phase with the local authority resulting in the holding of an LRD meeting and the issuing of an LRD opinion as to whether the proposals constitute a reasonable basis for submitting an application.The application stage involves a standard application, to be made to the city or county council, with a mandatory eight-week timeframe for decisions. On the appeal stage, the decision of the planning authority may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, in which case the board has a mandatory 16-week timeframe for decisions. That is new. The Bill also proposes a number of transitional arrangements relating to the expiry of the SHD arrangements and their replacement by the new LRD arrangements.  I welcome the ending of the SHD process. The legislation was deeply flawed, undermined county development plans, rode roughshod over local democracy and failed to deliver housing. The new LRD process will ensure future applications have regard to county development plans, many of which councillors across the county have worked on or are working on. This will fulfil the need for democracy in this process. The LRD process will ensure a more appropriate process for large-scale applications. This is welcome. I hope it will deliver housing. I will be supporting the Bill and I look forward to hearing from the Minister regarding reasonable amendments such as those allowing councils to seek further information. Perhaps, in his closing remarks, the Minister will confirm whether councils can seek further information in the process. Will applicants still be required to provide drawings, plans and other information through a specific dedicated website under the LRD process or will it be for the councils to provide that information on their planning websites?  To go back to the points raised by my colleagues, it is important to remember that the SHD process was meant to accelerate the processing of applications. It probably did that but how many of those applications actually came to fruition? I am thinking about a specific case in my own constituency, in Carrickmines, where planning permission for a 22-storey building was granted in the middle of what is, in theory, a residential area. It would have been far greater in height than any other proposed building, whether residential or otherwise, in that area. We need to look at the heights, the mix and the facilities. The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach himself spoke about facilities in respect of SHDs. We need to look at what is provided around these proposed developments. We need units to be developed. That is for sure. However, they have to be appropriate for the area with regard to their scale, their size and the amenities they offer. In moving away from the SHD process, the Minister and his officials have heard the genuine concerns of the people over recent years since the SHD process was brought in in 2016. Many of the changes being proposed today are very welcome and will be welcomed by members of the public engaging with the various processes and applications. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Government's proposed redress scheme for people who spent time in mother and baby homes. As the Taoiseach noted in his apology earlier this year, the State failed these women and children. It did not uphold its duty of care or the basic standards of humanity. An apology alone is not enough. There must be accountability, redress and justice for everyone who went through a mother and baby home. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, stated earlier this week that there are no easy answers when it comes to providing a remedy for the significant grief and anguish caused to the women and children who spent time in these institutions. No financial payment or service will ever take back the injustice, inhumanity and hurt suffered by these women and children after decades of failure. It is almost a year since the report of the commission of investigation was published. It is still a matter of regret that the commission has refused to deal with legitimate queries from survivors, public representatives and the media. At the time of publication, the Government made commitments to respond to the needs and concerns of those who spent time in the institutions. Since then, legislation has been advanced to allow for the proper identification and burial of the babies at Tuam, to provide access to the birth and early-life information of people who were adopted and to open the commission’s archive to more than 300 survivors. Work is under way to establish a national memorial and records centre relating to institutional trauma and to create a children’s fund to honour the memory of the children who died in mother and baby homes by providing supports to children who experience disadvantage in the present day. On 16 November, the Government approved proposals for a mother and baby institutions payment scheme and published an action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions. The scheme will provide approximately 34,000 former residents of the institutions with a financial payment and 19,000 with an enhanced medical card. The scope of the scheme goes well beyond the recommendations of the final commission report. The commission had set an arbitrary benchmark whereby a pregnant woman would have had to have been resident in an institution for six months before being eligible for redress. I am glad to see the Government rejected this recommendation and expanded the scheme to include all mothers who went through an institution. The scheme will also include children, both unaccompanied and accompanied, who spent more than six months in an institution. There are very welcome aspects to the scheme. Survivors I spoke to wanted a scheme that was non-adversarial, simple and based on trust, a scheme that would accept their lived experience and deal with matters promptly without long delays. Many of them do not have time. It is important that we acknowledge both their sharing of their stories with the commission and the stories of hurt and pain shared this evening through colleagues. Significant contributions to the scheme will be sought from relevant religious congregations. I hope they will move quickly to deal with their obligations. It must be acknowledged that not everyone is satisfied with the composition of this scheme. The scheme does not deal with children who were boarded out. Some children who were boarded out spent more than six months in an institution and will be eligible for the scheme, but I ask the Minister to consider what can be done for the cohort who spent less than six months in an institution. Overall, I welcome the Government’s commitment to continue to engage with the women and children who went through these institutions to meet their important needs, including through counselling for all survivors, access to information and records, memorialisation, financial payments, health supports and other key initiatives.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Ceann Comhairle back. Today is the last day of national diabetes awareness month. I am the chairperson of the all-party Oireachtas committee on diabetes. The Taoiseach will be aware that my colleagues and I meet regularly with various organisations to discuss the issues facing people living with diabetes here in Ireland. Those same people are keen to see the expansion of digital health services, the delivery of care more effectively, the empowerment of patients to access their medical records and the provision of more services to patients in their homes and communities. They would like to see more investment in modern e-health and ICT infrastructure, in line with Project Ireland 2040 and the e-health strategy for Ireland. Significant progress on medical ICT infrastructure was made during the course of the pandemic, with GPs improving e-health measures and providing for the secure electronic sharing of patient information and lab results, etc. The electronic health record system, with its individual health identifier programme, is being rolled out within Children's Health Ireland and the initiative should be expanded across the HSE hospital network. Perhaps the Taoiseach could give an update on this area and raise the matter with the Minister for Health. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Ireland's vaccination campaign has been a great national success. Almost all adults have been vaccinated and we have the highest rate in Europe. Great credit is due to everybody involved, particularly front-line staff in the HSE centres, nurses, GPs and pharmacists. The national immunisation advisory committee's recommendation that every adult should be offered a third dose of vaccine is very welcome. We have seen the impact of boosters in both the UK and Israel. Almost 880,000 people in this country have received a booster, which is very positive news. However, we have seen issues with long queues at some HSE centres, which it is hoped will be resolved very quickly. People with underlying conditions are currently eligible to receive their booster dose from their GP. However, this may not be an option for them as many GPs are not offering boosters to those aged under 70 years. Many people cannot access the HSE walk-in clinics and they report having difficulty making bookings at pharmacies. This is making it very challenging for people with underlying conditions, some of which are quite serious, to access the booster programme. Will the Tánaiste raise this matter with the Minister for Health? How does he see the booster campaign progressing over the coming weeks?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Recent corporation tax receipts have demonstrated that the Irish economy is rebounding strongly from the shocks of Covid-19 and indeed Brexit, as the Taoiseach alluded to in an earlier response. However, it is a two-track recovery, with businesses in the technology, pharma and financial services doing extremely well, while many businesses in the hospitality, entertainment and event sectors are struggling. The Government's commitment to these sectors and their employees is appreciated. However, the latest round of restrictions is having a significant impact on these businesses. Can the Taoiseach provide an update on recent engagements with these sectors and an indication of when targeted supports will be introduced?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is encouraging to see Ireland’s booster the campaign ramping up with more pharmacists, GPs and, indeed, HSE staff coming on board in a national effort to offer people a third vaccination before the Omicron variant becomes dominant. International evidence suggests a third dose of the mRNA vaccine offers significant protection against the Omicron variant. The national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, recommendation is that every adult who has received the one-shot Janssen vaccine can be offered the mRNA three months after their initial inoculation, which is very welcome. However, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s cannot access the booster campaign. Many of them followed public health advice in good faith and took the Janssen vaccine at the early stages of the initial vaccination programme. Will the Minister raise this situation with the Minister for Health and ask that an exemption be considered to the operational aspects of the campaign to allow those age cohorts access to vaccination either through their pharmacists or GPs?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I often invite Deputy Murnane O'Connor to Dún Laoghaire but I think this is the only place in Dublin and outside County Carlow she actually attends. I too join other Deputies in wishing the Ceann Comhairle and all the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas a very happy, peaceful and indeed healthy Christmas. It has been a very challenging year for the House and its Members. I thank all the staff for their patience and assistance during that time. I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the Covid-19 situation. Who thought we would be discussing the pandemic at a second Christmas? We thought over the last couple of months that things were changing but we need only look at the epidemiological forecast. It looks extremely challenging, especially if we look across the water. It is likely we are facing a very significant wave of infection generated by the Omicron variant. Initial evidence suggests Omicron infections can be milder to vaccinated people but it seems to be significantly more transmissible. The situation in London is an indication of what we could be facing here. We are in a race against time to ensure as many people as possible are offered a third vaccination before Omicron becomes more established here. The national effort being deployed and the news today that additional resources are being deployed are exceptionally welcome. I also welcome the news that the HSE centres will have extended opening hours and that we are on track to administer at least 300,000 vaccinations in the next week. I pay tribute to all the front-line staff, pharmacists and GPs working on the national effort to administer as many third doses of the vaccine as possible. I ask the Minister of State to raise the issue of people who received the one-shot Jansen vaccine. Many of them took it quite some time ago and evidence suggests immunity is waning. Many of them have contacted me and are asking that they be permitted to get vaccinated as soon as possible. While there may be a very challenging few weeks ahead, we know there is cause for hope as the antiviral medications are coming on stream. Hopefully, those combined with the boosters will ease the incidence of very serious infection. Just as I paid tribute to the front-line workers, it is also important to pay tribute to teachers and school staff because they have put in so much work to ensure students are safe and to reduce infection in those situations. Last of all, I pay tribute to the Ceann Comhairle and his colleagues in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I thank him for his assistance during the year and wish him and his family a happy Christmas.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In this, the closing debate of this Dáil term and of 2021, I thank Deputy Howlin for bringing forward this Bill. As the contributions heretofore have highlighted, it is an important Private Members' Bill because as Deputy Howlin said, the world has changed and financial institutions have changed. In fact, the world has shrunk in the context of the ability to move assets of all types very quickly into different jurisdictions and it has become more complex for states to respond to that type of behaviour. That is why it is important to discuss the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, the thrust and intentions of which I fully support. I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing this Bill. It is very important that it proceeds to the next Stage so that it can be fleshed out and elaborated. It is a pity that there are not more Deputies contributing to this very important debate. Like Deputy Bacik, I have worked for the past two years with Front Line Defenders. Working with that organisation allows those of us who are fortunate to live in a very stable democracy to get a glimpse into the world of those who are not as fortunate, who do not live in stable democracies or who have no democracy at all. The totalitarian states that some people live in and the fear they live under bear no comparison with the western world. I want to praise all front-line defenders for the work they do. This Bill has its origins in the Magnitsky legislation and it is important to remember the brutal nature of Sergei Magnitsky's death in 2009. His courage and legacy live on in various parliaments around the world. I am pleased that the Bill is not being opposed and will progress to Second Stage. The international criminal justice net needs to be tightened further and Ireland needs to play its part in that regard. While we have the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and other iterations, it is important that we review our stance and our ability to respond to these issues. The extended scope and definition of the criminal conduct element of this Bill would be subjected to inevitable and possibly protracted legal debate within various jurisdictions. Obviously, we have to realise that some of those jurisdictions do not have the most robust legal systems. Therefore, it is incumbent on us to play our part in Ireland and to encourage our European counterparts to do likewise. I want to highlight a specific element of the Bill to which Deputy Howlin referred earlier. The Bill provides that conduct constitutes a gross human rights abuse if it meets certain conditions, one of which is that it is "carried out by, or at the instigation or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official...". It is important that this House scrutinises that provision further on Committee Stage because while I accept that definition, we need to be as broad as possible to ensure that various scenarios which may arise in the context of the intentions of this Bill are considered. I will leave it at that. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for everything this year. I also thank the Minister of State for participating in this debate.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We witnessed a very significant volcanic eruption over the weekend which obliterated the south Pacific island of Hunga Tonga. The eruption generated a tsunami and ash cloud which has devastated the island nation of Tonga. We heard this morning that the first aircraft with relief supplies has arrived from New Zealand and according to the UN, about 84,000 people, more than 80% of the population, have been badly affected by the disaster with the supply of safe drinking water being one of the top issues. Can the Tánaiste please confirm what efforts Ireland, and indeed the European Union, are making as regards the financial aid, and indeed COVAX, to support the population of over 100,000 people on the island nation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle. I welcome the publication of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022. At the outset I thank the Minister and his officials for progressing this important legislation. It has been discussed many times in this House, has been demanded not only by Members but by the public, has been long-awaited by many and follows decades of attempts to amend the Adoption Act 1952, which in many ways copper-fastened a culture of distrust and secrecy around adoptions in our society. This legislation will provide a clear and guaranteed legal right: the right to a birth certificate; the right to birth, early life and care information; the right to medical information; and the right to documents like baptismal certificates to everyone who was adopted, boarded out, subject to those illegal adoptions or who resided in a mother and baby or county home, which I hope will also be addressed in time. I was contacted by a constituent not too long ago who told me a story of where in school, she dreaded every time a baptismal certificate was requested because of the rigmarole she had to go through and of the fear that it instilled in her. In fact, the publication of the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes prompted her to make contact with me to tell of her story and the trauma that it all brought back to her as a child. The Bill establishes a statutory tracing service, a statutory contact preference register and, importantly, provides for the safeguarding of adoption and related records. The legislation also addresses the issues facing people who are the subject of an illegal birth registration, providing a legal mechanism for the registration of accurate information. I know the Minister has accepted many of the recommendations proposed during the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which is very welcome. There are, however, still a number of points I would like to raise in the time available. The text and language around “illegal adoptions” is less than satisfactory and I hope the Minister would consider recognising the reality of the situation and strengthening the language. A number of issues have been highlighted, by people who were adopted and representative groups, including around the need for mandatory information sessions before details can be released in circumstances where a birth mother has expressed a no-contact option. Speakers have noted that the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, provides a right to access to personal information and they have suggested that a legislative framework may be unnecessary. As noted by some speakers, including my party colleague Deputy O’Callaghan, the courts have upheld the right to identity but they have also noted the rights to privacy. In my view the right to identity is a principal right, particularly the right to medical information. While I accept GDPR may vindicate this right, it also creates a situation where individual data controllers are assessing applications and interpreting rights. I have personal experience of constituents who were adopted being passed from the institutions to Tusla and back to institutions, time and again. This is very frustrating given the ordeal that these people have already had to endure. There are other cases, such as that of another constituent, Susan Kiernan - I raise her name because it is in the public domain, a Cheann Comhairle - who was illegally adopted. She and her daughter Lisa Kiernan had dreadful difficulty establishing information. Their case has been well-highlighted to date. This situation is completely unsatisfactory and I welcome the standard legislative format established by this Bill.  Speakers from across the House have raised many other important points. In the general spirit of cross-party support for the legalisation I ask the Minister to give these suggestions detailed consideration as this Bill progresses. Gabhaim buíochas.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I join my colleagues in extending my condolences to the family of Noel Treacy, who, as a Member of this House, represented Galway East for almost 30 years. In my time knowing Noel and campaigning with him, I was always amazed by his ability with names and his connection with people up and down the country. He will be fondly remembered in this Chamber by all people of all parties and none. He made a significant contribution to public life as a Deputy, a Minister and in his leadership role in Galway GAA. I offer my sympathies to his wife, Mary, and their children. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam. I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for introducing the Higher Education Authority Bill. I will be supporting this piece of legislation which will reform how our higher education institutions operate. The Bill seeks to reform the supervision and regulation of HEIs and to modernise the regulatory role of the HEA. The Bill introduces a number of welcome requirements, including obligations on third level institutions to engage in strategic planning, enhanced engagement with students, improved access to higher education, comprehensive collection of statistics and other measures to ensure a consistent approach to governance is ensured across the sector and country. We are lucky in Ireland to have a number of outstanding third level institutions. Trinity College Dublin, TCD, and UCD are well known throughout the world. Academics and students from TCD and UCD, and of course UCC, NUIG, UL and Maynooth University have made a significant contribution to Irish society and internationally over the years, noting, of course, James Joyce, one of UCD’s most prominent graduates, who published his masterpiece Ulysses on this day 100 years ago in Paris. In recent years we have seen the development of the higher education sector with even more students than ever taking up third level courses at traditional institutions and also the new technical universities, such as the Technological University Dublin. I welcome many of the proposed governance arrangements in this Bill, particularly the changes to ensure the unique and historic arrangements at Trinity College are respected. I thank the Minister for taking on board the feedback from academics at the university. Academic freedom is a core principle and nothing in this legislation will impinge on the academic freedom of higher education institutions or their staff which must continue to be protected in legislation.  It is apt that the Minister of State with responsibility for skills and further education, Deputy Niall Collins, is in the Chamber because I also welcome the provisions of this Bill that will further develop opportunities for apprenticeships. As we deal with the housing crisis and the challenges of climate change, including the need to retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes, we will need a new generation of skilled, educated workers. This Bill will help further that critical objective. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Professor Andrew Deeks, the president of UCD, who is due to take up the post of president of Murdoch University, Perth, Australia. Professor Deeks has ably led the university since 2014, introducing many changes and overseeing a transformative programme at the institution. I wish him, his wife, Dr. Linda Deeks, and their daughter, Pearl, all the best as they depart.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	He would get away with it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware of the significant impact that inflation is having on individuals and families across this country. The budget's increases in the fuel allowance were welcome, as are plans to give householders €113 credit against their electricity bills. However, these measures will only go so far. We know that inflation is likely to be higher than what was anticipated at the time of the budget. Will the Taoiseach consider increasing the electricity credit beyond €113 and rolling out an improved retrofitting scheme for minor improvements, for example, attic or other home insulation schemes?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Workers have returned, and are returning, to offices across the country, with many now working on a hybrid basis. Some work some days in the office and others work remotely from locations either at home or within the local town or village. However, the increased cost of fuel is having a significant impact on those workers. As part of efforts to combat climate change, promote modal shift and support workers, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to consider introducing free or discounted public transport options on a trial basis, perhaps here in the capital? This could include free or discounted fares for 90-minute journeys for all commuters across DART, Luas, bus or intercity services.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Tánaiste will be aware from his time as Minister for Health of the challenges faced by children with spina bifida and their families in their daily lives. One such family, Tanya and Colin Boyce from Dún Laoghaire, recently shared the story of their four and a half-year-old daughter, Cara, and the impact the waiting lists and delays are having on her health. Children and adults with spina bifida and hydrocephalus need to be prioritised. I am aware of the recent multi-annual funding of €4 million from the Government, along with an additional €1 million to Children's Health Ireland. However, the medics and parents are unsure about the allocation to spina bifida specifically. I ask the Tánaiste to raise the matter with the Minister for Health and to engage with Professor Connor Green from Cappagh Hospital, who has a plan to clear 80% of the waiting lists. I ask the Tánaiste to raise that matter directly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Government's cost-of-living package is very welcome, particularly the €200 household electricity credit along with the €125 lump sum to those in receipt of fuel allowance, as well as the 20% reduction in transport fares for the 19 to 23-year-olds, along with the reduction in the drug payment scheme threshold to €80. The €200 household electricity credit will be applied to more than 2.1 million homes across the State. A number of people have been in contact with me who are on prepaid meters and are seeking clarity around those arrangements for them. Will the Taoiseach raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and request that arrangements be put in place to give prepaid customers a credit for their meter, not just to the underlying account, in order that they can get the benefit of the credit right away and not have to wait for the adjustment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for that update. The census is due to be conducted on Sunday, 3 April. Can he provide us with an update on its preparation? The census will provide a snapshot of post-Covid Ireland at the start of the 21st century. If arrangements have not been finalised, I ask the Minister of State to consider introducing indicators and questions in respect of the impact of climate change and biodiversity. Perhaps questions regarding the use of pay-as-you-go meters could be obtained as it is a strong indication of financial strain on households. While we are discussing census 2022, I ask the Minister of State to consider accelerating the publication of the 1926 census. This is an issue I have raised previously in the Chamber. It has the potential to drive an interest in Ireland from diaspora. I take this opportunity to thank the visitors from the US who are in the Public Gallery today. The early publication of the 1926 census could be a boost for Irish tourism.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an outrageous attack on an independent country. It is a proud, peace loving nation with a rich history. The attack undermines the rule of law, breaches the UN charter and has the potential to create another humanitarian crisis across Europe. Ireland and Ukraine have strong political ties as well as social ones. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and our diplomats are working in Ukraine to evacuate Irish citizens caught up in the conflict. However, there are many Ukrainians here with ties to Ireland, who have family there, who are very worried about their safety. Will the Government waive the visa requirements and offer them humanitarian assistance to come to Ireland in the coming days and weeks?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his update on work of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, particularly with regard to climate and biodiversity, housing and the shared island initiative. Like all Deputies across this House, I have been appalled by the war of aggression being waged by Russia and now, it would appear, Belarus, against the people of Ukraine. News last week that the Irish visa requirements will be lifted is very welcome, as is the €10 million relief fund. Families in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire are making arrangements to host friends and family from Ukraine. Will the Taoiseach provide an update on Ireland's short- and medium-term plans to accommodate people fleeing Ukraine? Will he appoint a Minister to co-ordinate efforts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	He does not know the answers to them.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his update on the implementation of his Department's Strategy Statement 2021-2023. This morning, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made an impassioned plea to the European Parliament during which he called for support from his European neighbours as his country resists Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine. It is disappointing to see reports of a number of Irish MEPs, including Mick Wallace, Clare Daly, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and Sinn Féin's Chris MacManus, supporting an amendment before the European Parliament that would delay Ukraine's accession to the EU. Will the Taoiseach advise whether Ireland will support Ukraine's accession to the EU and indicate what practical supports Ireland can give as the Ukrainian people fight for their lives and their independence?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I concur and support much of what has been said by my colleague, Deputy Lahart. Like all Deputies across this House, the Irish people and almost everyone around the world, have been shocked and truly appalled by the illegal war of aggression being waged by Russia and now Belarus on the people of Ukraine. The war is a clear breach of the United Nations Charter. It is causing untold suffering for the people of Ukraine and it is creating a human catastrophe in Europe. Over 650,000 Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, families have been split, people have lost everything. We are hearing stories of men in particular being asked to remain, choosing fighting over their families. It churns the stomach of the Irish people that this could happen again on the Continent of Europe when we thought we were living in a time of peace. Russia’s prosecution of the war has been appalling. The use of cluster munitions and other weapons on an indiscriminate basis against residential areas constitutes war crimes. These crimes must be investigated. I support the calls of other Deputies in that regard. The international community and particularly the European Union cannot stand idly by while a democratic state with a rich cultural and social history is snuffed out.  I welcome multilateral sanctions against the Russian regime by the EU and other nations. I welcome commitments today by several party leaders across the House with regard to the need to facilitate Ukraine’s membership of the EU. Efforts earlier today by some Irish MEPs to frustrate the process for reasons known only to them were bizarre and shameful. On a practical basis, Ireland should do everything it can to assist the people of Ukraine in their hour of need. I welcome the lifting of visa requirements for Ukrainians coming to Ireland, the establishment of a relief fund and plans to support Ukrainians fleeing to Ireland in a special refugee programme. Efforts by individuals and groups across Ireland should also be acknowledged.  It would be remiss not to recognise those brave Russian citizens who have come out to protest the illegal war against their neighbours in Ukraine. Like all of us, they are disgusted. I support this motion. It demonstrates the resolve of this House and the Irish people. Even at this late stage, like all Members of the House, I would like to see Russia and Belarus do the right thing. They can and should do that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have been contacted recently by a number of constituents who have reported that some insurance companies are asking landlords to provide details on the status of their tenants. Questions they ask include whether they in receipt of the housing assistance payment, whether they are employed, whether they are refugees and whether they are professionals.The response to these questions by the landlords could impact on the insurance premiums. This practice strikes me as extremely discriminatory and has the potential to further distort our housing market and to make it more difficult for many individuals and families to secure much-needed rented accommodation. Is the Tánaiste aware of this practice, which seems to have spread from the UK? Will he ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to contact the Central Bank of Ireland to investigate it and revert to me? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for taking this question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who I know cannot be here. This is a very important and pressing issue in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's ongoing efforts and engagements with the families, the staff and service users of Dunmore House and Carmona Services, particularly throughout the pandemic. She has been very generous with her time, engaging on Zoom and attending on-site meetings with those involved. However, parents, guardians and friends of Carmona Services have been in contact with me in recent days and they are very concerned. Not only were they concerned prior to this latest twist in respite care locally, but they were concerned about the waiting list for respite care generally in community healthcare organisation, CHO 6. They were advised through written correspondence from the HSE and St. John of God that a respite house in Wyattville Park has been allocated solely to one individual, which is as a result of a court case. While we acknowledge and understand the need to allocate that property to one individual, it is obviously needed, there is now a situation in which 88 people are waiting for respite, as well as an additional 33 people on a waiting list. Many of their respite hours are in jeopardy because this property was a key tool in respite within the area and for those families. It is the only respite house available to those 88 people with intellectual disabilities. This is causing extreme distress and hardship to families. Some have been offered alternative respite 130 km away in County Wexford, which is obviously not suitable. I know the Minister of State recently committed €9 million for the provision of respite care, which is very welcome, but we have a situation in CHO 6, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin south-east and north Wicklow, whereby we have lost key respite services. It is causing significant distress to parents and families. Just as we are beginning to return to some level of normality, they have no clarity on respite services. Will the Minister of State engage with officials in her Department, the HSE and St. John of God to expedite the purchase of a new respite property? I know this cannot be done overnight, but the letter is quite vague in that regard. It alludes to the purchase and provision of more respite services, which were needed anyway, but this problem has exacerbated the issue facing these families and the individuals with intellectual disabilities. Can we fast-track the purchase of a property and all that entails with planning and retrofitting? It is an issue of real urgency and that is why I raise it today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for her reply and for a copy of her statement. I specifically did not mention Ravenswell initially because it is part of the problem but that was before the latest news about Wyattville Park. The challenges that have faced Ravenswell have been there for quite some time, and recruitment was an issue long before it became an issue generally in every sector in society. I will come back to that again directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is aware of it. In her statement, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said that, occasionally, respite services must be temporarily curtailed, which is understood and, unfortunately, families have witnessed that over the years. She said that the HSE has requested information from St. John of God Services about creating a list for priority. That is welcome but her statement goes on to say that, over the next six months, communication will issue to all individuals outlining the detail proposed for supported holidays, including any transition plans that are required. I ask, through the Minister of State, that the Department of Health make urgent contact with the HSE specifically around speeding up that process. There is no lack of resources within the Department of Health or the HSE to try to assist St. John of God's. This is having an enormous impact on families in south-east Dublin and north Wicklow. This news came as a bolt from the blue to them but, as I said, they have been impacted for so long by the impact of changes in respite care that many of the families cannot even plan six days in advance, let alone six weeks in advance, because they do not know when respite is coming. They do know one thing for sure, which is that respite is not coming for the foreseeable future for any of the individuals who were allocated to Wyattville Park. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, through the Department of Health, to try to speed up the process as much as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this initiative by the Government to tackle the skyrocketing rate of inflation we are witnessing, as all consumers are right across the globe. It should be recognised by all Members of this House that this is yet another constructive measure by this Government to assist those struggling individuals, households and businesses at this difficult time. Everyone is affected, not least those on low income and social welfare. For those in jeopardy of falling into a poverty trap, this year's budget, which was announced just last October, contained more than €1 billion in significant tax and social welfare measures to assist those middle- and low-income earners. Those measures were recognised by the Economic and Social Research Institute as progressive but I would be first to say they cannot be stand-alone measures and they must be kept under constant review over the coming weeks and months. It is true to say that nobody could have foreseen what the world would be facing in early 2022 last October, with the rate of inflation far exceeding what was anticipated at that time. The worry at that time was simply the post-pandemic supply chain disruption and inflationary cycle. Sadly, as we exit the pandemic, we are confronted with the invasion of a sovereign state of Ukraine, which presents many challenges not only to Ireland but to other nations too. It presents challenges on several fronts domestically from a humanitarian, educational, energy, health, food and financial perspective. As was said last October and earlier today as well, this volatile inflationary period in which we are currently locked is being kept under review by the Government, which I welcome. All levers of the economy are being examined and they should be kept under constant review. It is not good enough for some Members of the House to just use sound bites. We need solutions and we need the Opposition and the Government to work collaboratively. Last week, President Higgins signed into law the legislation for the emergency benefit scheme for electricity costs. That will see an important package of more than €500 million to allow for a €200 energy credit for more than 2.1 million homes across the State, along with a much-needed lump sum payment of €125 for those in receipt of fuel allowance. Tonight, the Government is bringing forward a €320 million package on excise that will see, if it is passed this evening, a price reduction in petrol, diesel and marked gas oil from tomorrow until at least Wednesday, 31 August. The public expects the Members of this House to work together. We are at an early stage of an extremely volatile time internationally and it is incumbent on all Deputies to work together and do what we can. We must try to quell the inflationary cycle we are in and the Government must work with all Deputies. Price gouging and any profiteering must be investigated. Those steps must be taken sooner rather than later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The risk of flooding for several large swathes of County Dublin and other coastal communities is a genuine environmental threat of which I know the Minister is acutely aware. I am sure he is also aware of the joint report on the status of Ireland's climate, which was produced in 2021, that shows sea levels have risen by 2 mm to 3 mm per year since the 1990s. Will the Minister provide an update on the multiannual investment for flood relief schemes contained in the programme for Government? Will he support using such flood defences for the purpose of completing the coastal route of the Sutton to Sandycove cycle path, which he, I and others have long supported and campaigned for.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We are very grateful in this House for the efforts of our front-line healthcare workers during the pandemic. They put themselves in danger and went above and beyond what was expected. The Government recently agreed to pay a €1,000 bonus to front-line workers in recognition of their extraordinary efforts. However, following recent media reports about the payment structure being considered, many part-time nurses have been in contact with me. They are worried that the proposed payment structure will see their bonus reduced to just €200. Everyone across the House recognises the need to be prudent with public money, but there is also a need to be fair and do right by people. Will the Minister engage with his colleagues and ask that a generous approach be taken, one that recognises the sacrifice made by all front-line healthcare workers, whether full-time or part-time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this opportunity to discuss the latest amendment to the Bretton Woods agreement. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing this Bill before the House. My party, Fianna Fáil, will be supporting the Bill. As the Minister of State has indicated, this legislation facilitates Ireland's continued involvement in the IMF's new arrangements to borrow and implements the decision adopted by the executive board of the IMF on 16 January 2020. The Bill facilitates Ireland's participation in the 2020 NAB decision, and future decisions, by means of a credit arrangement with the IMF that will be provided by the Central Bank of Ireland, acting on behalf of the State. The Bill amends the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Act 1999 to reflect the renaming of the ESAF Trust as the PRGT and increases "the aggregate amount of grant contributions that the Minister for Finance may pay". The Bill also amends the Bretton Woods Agreement Act 1957 "to provide for the payment of grant contributions by the Minister for Finance in respect of the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, CCRT, and trust funds established or to be established by the IMF in accordance with Article V (2)(b) of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund". These measures are important in order to ensure that Ireland can fully participate in the programmes of the IMF. The PRGT is an opportunity for low-income countries to access interest-free loans for capacity-building activities that can boost domestic revenues, manage public finances and regulate financial systems, while progressing towards the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs. The catastrophe containment and relief trust supports low-income countries impacted by the most serious of natural disasters, such as those we have seen in recent years. It also assists countries battling public health disasters, such as infectious disease epidemics, with grants for debt service relief. As of December 2021, $976 million of funding support was approved for 31 countries to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The fund was previously accessed to support Ebola-afflicted countries such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Given the current post-pandemic uncertainty and Russia's despicable war in Ukraine, international organisations like the IMF provide an important safety net for many countries and make an important contribution to the rules-based order. Undoubtedly, the recent increases in energy prices and input costs to food and materials caused by the war in Ukraine will have an impact in Ireland and other EU states. However, EU states have the capacity to deal with these crises. Increases in the costs of energy and food, in particular, may have a significant destabilising impact on lower income countries, causing great suffering for millions of people. International bodies like the IMF provide an important safety net in these circumstances. I should say, however, that their role and their financial assistance in those circumstances must be reviewed and it must be ensured that the finance provided is used for the correct purposes. That said, I welcome Ireland's enhanced participation in this programme and I will be supporting the Bill.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I also express my condolences to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on the passing of his mother. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could update the House on the Government's insurance reform agenda and the work being carried out to ensure the benefits are being passed on to consumers.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	We have seen those reductions particularly in motor insurance. People have experienced them. There has been good feedback from younger drivers in particular. That was a perennial issue for many years. Reducing the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses is critical, particularly when we see costs increase in energy, retail and other areas. I welcome the priority given to this issue by the Government. I acknowledge the work done in this area by the Ministers of State, Deputies Fleming, Troy and James Browne, and also by the Ministers for Finance; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Justice. I commend them on their efforts because from the get-go they have engaged with the insurance companies and we are seeing the benefits. The personal injury guidelines are clearly having impacts on the size of awards. Some 20% of awards are now under €5,000 and 29% are between €5,000 and €10,000, which means nearly half the awards are under €10,000. That compares with just 12% in 2020. Will the Minister of State give an indication of progress on the remaining actions in the Government's action plan on insurance reform?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Given the very significant reduction in the cost of awards, as I outlined, and the introduction of other measures, consumers and businesses will expect proportionate reductions in premiums to bring them into line with EU averages. I think we are seeing that. Consumers are certainly feeling that when they renew or examine other policies. If that trend continues, we will be in a very good position and more aligned with our EU counterparts than before. The work being undertaken is being felt by consumers at a critical time given the rise in costs in other areas.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister will be aware the National Transport Authority, NTA, has licensed Aircoach to operate six routes connecting Dublin Airport with Dublin, Cork, Galway and Belfast cities. It must be acknowledged that management and staff, particularly the drivers at Aircoach, deserve great credit for keeping the service running during Covid-19. However, I have been contacted by customers who use a free travel pass and who find themselves disadvantaged as they cannot book an Aircoach ticket online. It is the only way of guaranteeing a seat on a particular service. Since passenger volumes have returned to normal, this has caused great anxiety. I am aware Irish Rail provide an online booking system for customers with the travel pass, which is very convenient. I have contacted Aircoach about this issue but have not received a reply. Will the Minister raise the issue, asking that the matter would be raised with the NTA, which is responsible for regulating, supervising and licensing the service, to ensure people with a travel pass are not disadvantaged?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government’s efforts to support people fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine. According to the UNHCR, more than 5.5 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine since the Russian invasion on 24 February. As of yesterday, 27,372 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine. A total of 18,661 people have sought accommodation through the international protection accommodation service scheme. I welcome confirmation from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that they have been offered safe emergency accommodation while long-term arrangements are being finalised. I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. I also thank his colleagues, the Ministers with responsibility for children, education and justice and other Departments and agencies for their efforts to date. I know staff have made a tremendous effort over the past few weeks to deal with this unprecedented challenge. I also commend local authority staff on their efforts. In Dún Laoghaire Rathdown we have seen fantastic initiatives and efforts made in recent weeks. As have other speakers, I highlight the tremendous welcome provided by the Irish people to people fleeing their homes in Ukraine and the efforts of local volunteers who have stepped up to support Ukrainians in towns and villages throughout Ireland. Given the extent of the situation, the State has done well to date, but there are longer-term issues. One can foresee pressures and challenges and the Minister might consider a number of suggestions. I have spoken to people who have offered homes or are considering offering homes, particularly on a more long-term basis. They feel guidance or standard arrangements for essentials such as insurance and terms of licences would be helpful. A modest payment to families hosting people to cover underlying costs might also be helpful. A modest grant, linked with appropriate terms and conditions, to bring housing stock up to standard might be a quick way to unlock long-term vacant stock. The Minister is examining this. Having visited Lithuania in March I am well aware of the feeling in the EU, particularly in the Baltic states which are subject to ongoing hostility and threats from Russia. Europe must continue to stand united against Russian aggression and sanctions must continue until Russia ends its war and occupation in Ukraine. In the meantime, Ireland must do everything we can to support the people of Ukraine. As noted by their ambassador to Ireland, H.E., Gerasko Larysa, Ukraine and its people are fighting for their existence in Russia's barbaric illegal war.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware that medical scientists in many HSE hospitals are due to strike tomorrow, which will have implications for patients and hospitals alike. Medical scientists provide 24-7 services in hospitals, and most of them have a science degree or a master's qualification. The action is in frustration over long-running pay and career development issues that are affecting recruitment and retention in the sector. The medical scientists will of course provide emergency cover, but elective surgeries will likely be impacted. Many of these patients have been waiting years for surgery.One multiple sclerosis patient who is attending the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is terrified that he will lose a hip replacement appointment for tomorrow. I ask the Taoiseach to raise this issue as a matter of urgency with the Minister for Health, ask for a fair settlement for medical scientists and ensure that any patients who are impacted will have their procedures rescheduled to the earliest possible date.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government's progress on delivering a just transition as Ireland implements a low carbon future. At the heart of the policy is recognition that families and communities must be supported and protected against the negative impacts of the transition away from fossil fuels. Key to supporting these initiatives is funding and we have seen €84.5 million secured from the EU's just transition fund for investment in longer-term transition over the coming decade. The fund will be complemented by Exchequer funding, which is welcome. I have been a long-standing supporter of retrofitting schemes and I welcome the Government's national retrofitting scheme. However, I am concerned about the delays in progress and about the capacity of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to roll it out at scale. I am also concerned about the lack of progress in retrofitting and improving our local authority housing stock, particularly in advance of what will be a very difficult winter. I ask the Minister to redouble efforts in this area to ensure that the local authorities have funding available to implement quick fixes as they prepare for a more extensive programme over the course of the decade. Recent changes to the better energy warmer homes scheme to expand eligibility for home owners in receipt of the disability allowance for over six months and who have a child under seven are extremely welcome. I ask the Minister to make a concerted effort to highlight these new opportunities.  I ask the Minister to examine the effectiveness of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to ensure it has sufficient resources to police energy companies and to ensure that customers are being offered the best rate. I have had reports of consumers being told certain products or special electricity rates would not suit them when it is clear from any objective analysis that they would be better off. I would also ask for arrangements and regulations around the district heating schemes to be examined. I have had reports of some district heating customers receiving notice of a fourfold increase in natural gas rates but as district heating customers, they have no power to change supplier.  As we move towards a low carbon economy, it is critical that people at risk of fuel and energy poverty or communities at risk of economic disadvantage are supported. The Government's medium and long-term strategy is sound but I would like to see more ambition in the short term.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Bill 2021. I thank the Minister and her officials for bringing the legislation before the House. I will be supporting this Bill which will bring Garda compensation claims within the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, process. The Bill is aimed at decreasing the length of time it takes for disposing of a Garda compensation claim from initial application to award by providing for clear time limits for each stage of the process. The new process is also aimed at ensuring that avenues for settlement and resolution are available at the earliest possible stage. Where cases end up before the courts, they can be dealt with at the appropriate level, not necessarily the High Court, which can speed up the process and reduce legal costs. Hopefully the Bill will simplify the system for gardaí who suffer an injury during the course of their duty. I want to use this occasion to pay tribute to gardaí for the work they do not only across the country, but in each individual community, particularly in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire where I recently had the pleasure of joining serving and retired gardaí and their families at events in Shankill and Dún Laoghaire Garda stations to mark the beginning of the centenary year of the first Civic Guards coming to Dún Laoghaire. Of course, the first policing presence in the area was established in 1836 with the founding of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, DMP, force. The first DMP officers in Dún Laoghaire were based at a facility on Cumberland Street, before moving to 100 Upper George’s Street in 1839. The police presence at 100 Upper George’s Street continued for over 150 years, when the Garda moved to its current station on Corrig Avenue in 1992. Over the years, hundreds of gardaí have served with distinction in the area. At last week's commemoration, we remembered the 83 fallen gardaí who made the ultimate sacrifice. We also remembered their colleagues who were severely injured in the course of carrying out their duties. Last week I had the great pleasure to meet the senior surviving garda from the old Dún Laoghaire station, Murt Gleeson, along with other former members who provided outstanding service to the community over the years including retired inspector Pat Neill and soon to be retired Detective Superintendent Martin Creighton and others. As we enter a very sensitive period of commemorations, I thank the Garda centenary committee in Dún Laoghaire for their efforts, led by Inspector Adrian Kelly, Garda John Paul Durkan, Garda David L’Estrange, Garda Caroline Sheridan, Garda Gemma Conway, Detective Garda Jim Mulligan and reserve Garda Kieran Browne, along with retired members, Eamon Hession, Angeline Conefry and of course Ed Ryan who did so much work researching the history of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire and Shankill. There will be other commemorations at Blackrock and other Garda stations, to mark the fantastic work done by gardaí over the past 100 years. As move to the second century of the Garda Síochána in Dún Laoghaire, I ask the Minister to raise the issue of facilities in the area with the Garda Commissioner. This has been discussed previously and considered by Garda headquarters in Phoenix Park. There has been exceptional population growth along the Luas green line, particularly from Carrickmines to Sandyford. It is estimated that almost 30,000 new residents will soon be living in this area. A new Garda station at Cherrywood is badly needed and I know it is open for consideration. So too is the need for a more modern station. The station in Dún Laoghaire was built in the 1990s. Given the increasing demographic in the area, it also needs modernisation. I hope the Minister will take that back to discuss with the Commissioner. I thank the Minister for staying for the full debate and listening to the views and considerations of Members. I hope all Members across the House will support this important legislation. It is not only important for the Garda but also important for the State.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Government’s strategic plan for the renewal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The plan sets out an ambitious timeline for a full organisational restructuring of the NPWS that I believe is much needed and long overdue. It provides a substantial €55 million additional investment in the organisation that will allow for the recruitment of 60 key new staff to critically important roles. The strategic action plan aims to deliver an NPWS that is more resilient, better resourced, and better equipped to play its part in Ireland’s response to the biodiversity emergency on the national and international stages. The plan will equip the NPWS with the organisational capability and supporting structures to enable it to deliver on its mandate in protecting our natural heritage. It is important to note that the plan fulfils a crucial commitment in the programme for Government, providing for a significant investment in and renewal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, and his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and their officials for preparing the plan and securing the necessary resources. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who is present, for his attendance. I will turn to our constituency of Dún Laoghaire for a moment.The National Parks and Wildlife Service, as the Minister of State would be aware, works closely with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to protect biodiversity at important sites such as Dalkey Island, where there is a significant Arctic tern colony as well as goats and all sorts of other wildlife that is all protected. Work is ongoing with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the local council.  The NPWS also supported efforts at Killiney Hill to expand the red squirrel population. Back in 2012, for example,15 red squirrels from the Raven Nature Reserve in County Wexford were released into the area to supplement the local population. This project has involved schoolchildren, which has helped promote awareness of the need for conservation and biodiversity locally. The additional funding being provided to the National Parks and Wildlife Service is very welcome. Hopefully, this will allow a greater focus on sites like the proposed natural heritage area at Loughlinstown Forest. This is an almost 20-acre forest and an important outpost of native broadleaf woodland in an increasingly urban area, but it has been largely overlooked for many years. The National Parks and Wildlife Service needs to not only work with local councils on issues such as forests, but also in relation to biodiversity corridors. Hopefully, with the additional resources it has been given, it will be able to work closely with those local authorities. Finally, as the citizens' assembly gathers to discuss biodiversity, it will make recommendations in due course, but in the meantime we need to take action and this national strategy is a very positive first step.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is worth asking.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I join my colleague in welcoming this discussion on the vital role of journalists in conflicts across the world. At the outset I pay tribute to the many very brave journalists and photojournalists who report and inform us from the many dangerous conflict zones around the globe. They carry out an indispensable and invaluable role. It is important that we stand in solidarity with journalists and continue to support their fundamental work. We must never take for granted the crucial role played by journalists, media workers and the free and independent media. At least seven journalists covering the war in Ukraine have been killed. There are ongoing investigations into the deaths of seven other journalists to determine if their deaths were work-related. One of those lost was Pierre Zakrzewski from Leopardstown in south Dublin. Most recently, on 11 May, there was the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin which must also be condemned. I welcome the Government’s call for a swift, thorough, and independent investigation. Her death and the subsequent appalling scenes at her funeral were disgraceful and cannot be ignored by the international community.  I understand An Garda Síochána is assisting its French colleagues in an investigation into the death in Ukraine of journalist Pierre Zakrzewski. Mr. Zakrzewski, who was 55 years of age and from Leopardstown, was killed when the car he was travelling in was hit by Russian shelling outside Kyiv on 14 March. He was working as a cameraman for the American channel Fox News. Two of his colleagues were also killed and injured. Mr. Zakrzewski held both Irish and French citizenship. The investigation into his death is being led by the French authorities with An Garda Síochána providing a supporting role. For now, this support is likely to be confined to the sharing of documents, including those related to the post mortem. Unlike in Ireland, French authorities have the power to investigate and prosecute the deaths of its citizens abroad. The French investigation is being led by the national counterterrorism prosecutor’s office, known as PNAT, and the central office for the fight against crimes against humanity, genocides and war crimes, which is a division of the French national police. Mr. Zakrzewski was born to a French mother and a Polish father and grew up in south Dublin, where he attended St. Conleth’s College and UCD. He was married to Michelle, a former BBC journalist, and covered conflicts in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. I wish to offer my condolences to Michelle and the extended Zakrzewski family. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, which is an independent, non-profit organisation that promotes press freedom worldwide, at least seven journalists covering the war in Ukraine have been killed. The CPJ is investigating the deaths of seven other journalists. Scores more have faced shelling, shooting and detention as they work to provide vital information about the invasion. It should also be noted that Russian journalists have been detained and threatened during Moscow’s crackdown on independent Russian media and many have fled the country. All states, not just Russia, must uphold basic standards to protect the standards of journalism and the safety of journalists while they carry out their work. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are raised regularly with me by constituents. On that note, I welcome students from Cabinteely Community School and their teacher, Mr. David Traynor, to the Dáil today. It should be noted that Ireland has been ranked sixth in a new press freedom index published by Reporters without Borders. While this is welcome, it is important that we redouble our efforts here in Ireland and use our influence abroad to continue to support the work of journalists and photojournalists.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have been contacted by many constituents who are very concerned about the situation at Dublin Airport. There have been regular reports of delays for passengers going through security screening, which have sometimes resulted in them missing their flights. Over the weekend, there were worrying reports about the airport failing the European Aviation Safety Agency audit and last night, we saw reports on social media of a brawl in the departure lounge. I know staff on the ground are doing their best in difficult circumstances but we were promised by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, that 300 new staff would be employed by the end of June. Will the Minister request an update from the DAA? Will he engage with it about the management of the airport?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I also welcome today's discussion about the Passport Office. At the outset, I acknowledge the work undertaken by the staff at the Passport Office. Like every organisation, during the pandemic it adapted its practices. It kept an emergency service going throughout the pandemic. Some of the Passport Office staff supported colleagues in the Department of Social Protection. I am sure all Deputies in the House are grateful for their efforts. With a relaxing of those Covid restrictions, more people need to get passports for the first time or renew existing passports. This, combined with issues relating to recruitment and staffing, has resulted in the backlogs and delays we are discussing today. We are now at a point where thousands of families are approaching summer travel dates and are very worried about having passports issued in time, particularly for children. To be fair, it is clear the passport online processing system for renewals is generally the best and most effective way. I welcome the Minister of State's statement on that today. We need to ensure that is communicated to the public. The main issue arises where people are making first-time applications, especially for children. The processing time for children's passports is having a significant impact on families as holidays loom. The process of checking the information on those applications can take several weeks, which leads to parents being alerted to problems weeks after the application, which they assumed was okay, becoming a problem. This can then result in a further delay for those applicants and is causing significant distress for parents. This is compounded by the difficulties people are encountering trying to get through to the Passport Office to get further updates on their applications. I ask for the procedure to be reviewed early, perhaps involving early checking of that documentation to resolve any issues relating to pictures, consent forms or other issues that may arise, especially with children's applications.The Passport Office needs more staff to clear these backlogs. I know the Minister prioritised this and staff are currently being recruited but we need to consider an immediate temporary redeployment of staff. I ask the Minister of State to look at the online tracking system and the information it gives applicants. It needs to be reformed because I am sure it actually causes some of the queries to the Passport Office. I also ask the Department to arrange a media campaign to raise awareness about the online service and to promote the urgent appointment service at Lower Mount Street. The one-day and four-day services are useful when people need a passport quickly for a non-emergency issue. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for being here today. I know he will take these suggestions back to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the Department and the Passport Office, which is ultimately responsible.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Deputy Ó Broin is sharing time with Deputy Gould.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Deputy McAuliffe for sharing time. I thank the members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, particularly the Chair, Deputy Matthews, for and commend them on their work. The 39 recommendations are interesting, to say the least. They cover quite a wide range of issues relating to urban regeneration, specifically dereliction and vacant properties. As my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, rightly stated, we are all aware of derelict sites that have been plaguing areas across the country for many years. Many of us have been local authority members. The Derelict Sites Act is often mentioned in replies from local authorities as being the instrument they can use. There are alleged pitfalls after that. One local authority I would like to commend on the work it has done is Monaghan County Council. It has used the Derelict Sites Act several times in town centres to issue CPOs in respect of land, sites and buildings. This is not necessarily about housing specifically. It can be about land or buildings zoned for commercial use. It can also be about individual properties. It can be complex or there can be financial concerns or issues within families or various entities, but ultimately, the site being vacant or derelict causes a problem. I agree with the committee's recommendation to establish a national register that is publicly available. We need to get to the bottom of it and to know how many sites there are. We need to segregate those that are derelict from those that are vacant. In Dún Laoghaire, there is a site that we have been in relentless contact with the local authority about. A colleague of mine on the council there, Justin Moylan, has taken up the mantle. Only after several representations about the matter did the council push the landowner to do something. It has plagued the locality for a long time. CPOs are the last resort. It should be a matter of using the carrot and the stick and encouraging landowners to utilise sites to the best of their ability. Ultimately, if regeneration of a site is required, so be it. However, landowners must maintain their sites. The committee has done an exceptional job at coming up with these recommendations. I hope the Department will be able to take action in respect of many of them. Housing for All allows for that. I thank the committee again for its contribution.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I ask the House to note that the amendments to the motion regarding energy security are displaying incorrectly on the Dáil website. The Regional Group's amendment to the Government amendment is displaying in two places as an amendment to the Government amendment and also as amendment No. 2 to the motion. It should be only displaying as an amendment to the Government amendment. The People Before Profit-Solidarity amendment, which should be displaying as amendment No. 2 to the motion, is displaying as amendment No. 3. With that in mind, I call Deputy Michael Collins, who will be followed by Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Nolan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As we gather here today, every 48 seconds someone dies of starvation in the horn of Africa. On Tuesday last Deputies were invited to a very stark briefing organised by Dóchas. We were addressed by the Dóchas CEO, Ms Jane-Ann McKenna, and four of the aid agencies operating in the horn of Africa, that is, Goal, Trócaire, Concern and Oxfam and were told that 181 million people in the horn of Africa face starvation due to food shortages, climate change and political unrest in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. The number of people facing extreme hunger has doubled in the last year. The UN estimates that 750,000 people across five countries are facing immediate starvation. I know that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Irish Aid officials are doing their best in very difficult circumstances but we need to redouble our efforts. The alarm for famine has been sounded in the horn of Africa. I ask the Tánaiste to provide an update on what the Irish Government is doing to assist people in the horn of Africa.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss and examine the supports available for people with special educational needs. As a society, it is critical we deliver an education system that is of high quality for all our children, where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach his or her full potential, and where every child with additional needs receives appropriate educational support based on his or her needs. Over the past 20 years, the system we are speaking about today was developed on a modest basis, and virtually all the Deputies who have spoken have made the point it is not fit for the purpose of the current day. While investment in the system is very welcome and necessary, it needs some sort of overhaul. I agree with Deputy Calleary’s remarks to the Minister of State. Special education is a priority for investment by the Government and I thank the Minister of State, along with her colleagues, the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for all their engagement and efforts to date. My constituency, Dún Laoghaire, has many exceptional service providers, such as the Carmona Services. People working in the sector go above and beyond to support people with special and additional needs and their families, which has to be acknowledged. This year, the Department of Education will spend more than €2 billion, or 25% of its budget, on providing additional teaching and care support for children with special educational needs, while last year's budget delivered significant funding for those with special educational needs. Over recent years, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased and stands at 2,148 for the school year 2021-22. The pandemic has, however, resulted in challenges for children with special needs and their families. As we all know in this House, the online learning many of them were offered was not suitable for some of their needs. Some of them could not engage and some of the physical, in-person activities and classes did not resume. In fact, some services still have not fully resumed and that is of great concern to the children in particular and to their families. While some efforts have been made to support them, we need to do more and, as we exit Covid, ensure services get back to full tilt this September.Budget 2022 provided for the creation 287 additional special classes for the year 2022-23 and some 269 new special classes opened for September 2021, with a further 33 opening during the 2021-22 school year. The remaining classes must be expedited over the next couple of weeks for September of this year. That said, some schools have informed me that the system is complicated and lengthy. It needs to be streamlined, mainly for the ASD units. I know the Minister of State is familiar with St. Mary's Boys National School in Booterstown. She will be aware that it tried to transform a local parish centre into an SEN unit. It should be remembered, however, that the principals are teachers primarily, not project managers. Greater support should be provided by the Department to allow them to focus on their school community and allow the project to work in tandem with that. SNAs should follow the child as well, which is something we heard earlier. I am aware of a number of cases where a child's much-needed SNA joins him or her in primary school and follows the child through his or her education, by and large. Come post-primary level, however, the child is left in the wilderness unless the school he or she is going to has the additional resources of an SNA. Even at that, some schools share SNAs, so there is no dedicated person who knows the children intimately and knows how to deal with and support them and their educational needs. The Minister of State will be aware of the work of the Parents, Family and Friends of Carmona Services in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has engaged with its representatives in recent months, which is much appreciated. I know they are eager to interact and meet the Minister of State again on the issue of residential care within community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6. As was said earlier about NEPS and SENOs, all the services that have developed over the last 20 years need to be reviewed, refined and tweaked to ensure children and their families feel the supports are there. The money going into these services is extremely welcome and necessary and it should continue but we also need to ensure it lands with those children who need it. While much has obviously been done for special education - I commend the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and her colleagues in this regard - we need to review and improve the processes for ASD and SEN units at all levels of education to ensure they are fit for purpose over the coming years.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would like to raise the issue of the lifetime loans being offered by some financial institutions. I recently raised the issue with the Minister for Finance by way of parliamentary question. I am asking for clarification on the number of lifetime loans being issued in this State. The Minister advised that the Central Bank regulates the product but it does not publish the data. I find this extraordinary. Perhaps the number of lifetime loans is so small that it is not a matter of concern but we do not know as the figures are not published. It does not tie in with the level of advertising the industry is conducting. Almost every time I turn on the radio, it feels like the products are being advertised day and night. According to one provider’s website, the cost of repaying a modest €75,000 loan taken out by someone at the age of 60 and repaid by the time the person is 85 is €292,000. Given the short- to medium-term economic outlook here and the implications this will have for older people, will the Minister for Finance contact the Central Bank asking for statistics on lifetime loans to be published?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I concur with Deputy Durkan on his remarks about hatred in particular. Unfortunately, we have seen too much of that, particularly in the recent past. I welcome the opportunity to discuss and debate the Government’s progress on supporting the LGBTQI+ community in Ireland. This debate is particularly timely during Pride month. I look forward along with other Members of this House to joining members of the LGBTQI+ community again at the annual Pride march this Saturday. This has been a challenging year for members of that community. I express my revulsion at the brutal murders of members of the community in Sligo and offer my condolences to their family and friends. Equally, we must remember people who have been attacked on the basis of their sexual orientation, particularly in this city and elsewhere throughout the country. There should be no place for intolerance in Ireland. The programme for Government commits to a series of reforms to create a fairer, safer and inclusive Ireland where people are supported to flourish and live inclusive, healthy and fulfilling lives whatever their sexual orientation or gender. Ireland’s first national LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022 is the primary policy vehicle to achieve this vision. It pursues objectives under four thematic pillars, providing a vision of an Ireland where LGBTI+ people are visible, included, treated equally, healthy, and feel safe and supported. It notes that many of the issues that prevent LGBTI+ people from achieving their full potential in Irish society are structural in nature and require a whole-of-government approach to devising appropriate solutions. The strategy contains a number of actions by An Garda Síochána to deepen LGBTQI+ awareness among front-line officers in order to better respond to the needs of victims of hate crime and the needs of the community in general. I commend the work of An Garda Síochána. Long before marriage equality, over many decades, gardaí have worked with members of that community hand in hand to ensure they felt safe and were safe in certain areas, particularly in this city, at a time when it was not safe to be a member of that community. Justice Plan 2022 commits to publishing the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill 2021 this summer. Strengthening our criminal legislation will be one element in a wider suite of measures across all areas of government designed to address hatred and intolerance in all its forms. The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The protected characteristics identified in the general scheme are race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, gender and disability. A review of the equality Acts is under way and legislative proposals are expected by the end of the year. A new strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is expected soon and recognises the need to provide support for all victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, irrespective of any characteristics they might have. It recognises the need to reflect the lived experience, particularly of victims and survivors, including LGBTI+, and acknowledges the additional risk factors created by overlapping forms of discrimination. My party, Fianna Fáil, wants to create a Republic founded on equality, dignity and opportunity for every citizen. Fighting discrimination in all its forms is one of the party’s core aims. We have committed to working for a fair and equal society for members of the LGBTQI+ community. The programme for Government contains a series of important commitments to support members of the community, including the implementation of a national youth strategy for the LGBTI+ community; a ban on conversion therapy; legislation to provide for adoptive leave; legislation to ban conversion therapy and the creation of a general health policy for transgender individuals. We have seen progress on many of these areas but support for trans healthcare is badly lacking and I would welcome an update from the Minister in his closing remarks. I would also like to see increased funding to support mental health services as part of the youth strategy. It is clear listening to the debate today that, unfortunately, homophobia still exists in Ireland despite all the progress that has been made for members of the community. As a society we must value every citizen and resident of the Republic. The ethos must be one of tolerance and inclusivity.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The programme for Government commits to supporting homeowners living with housing defects. I have been approached by residents of Carrickmines Green, an estate in Carrickmines owned by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.Construction at Carrickmines commenced in 2005, with many residents moving in shortly afterwards. However, the developer went under in mid 2009 and the residents were left living in a so-called ghost estate for many years until the receiver McStay Luby and NAMA began to complete the project. In 2015, there was a fire in an unfinished block. A subsequent fire safety report raised issues and recommended extensive repairs to fire-stopping materials across the estate. I understand some of these works have taken place but many remain outstanding. The issue is now urgent as residents have been advised they cannot renew their insurance. Will the Tánaiste raise this matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, asking NAMA to engage with the residents to find a solution?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	We join the Deputy in wishing him a happy birthday.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Government has made several welcome efforts to cushion families from the increase in energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine and Putin's attempt to use gas and oil as strategic weapons against the west. In April, the Minister committed to introducing a scheme to offer solar panels to people with high energy usage due to a medical need or to elderly people at risk of energy poverty. As he is aware, I raised this issue with him last month by way of a parliamentary question. It was confirmed at that stage that the issue was with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and stakeholders for review. I ask the Minister to provide an update as winter is rapidly approaching. Many of these families have contacted me. Many of them want to make arrangements for the months ahead. When will the scheme go live?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this legislation, which updates the substitute-consent regime provided in the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Bill's purpose is essentially to streamline the substitute-consent procedure in the planning system. Streamlining of the substitute-consent regime is required to increase the efficiency and utility of the process in order to safeguard confidence in the Irish planning system by eliminating a surplus step in the substitute-consent process. It will also ensure that the system is fully in compliance with EU environmental requirements and recent court judgments. In this context, it is proposed to provide for a single-stage application process under the remit of An Bord Pleanála, which would replace the current two-stage process. It is also proposed to amend section 37L of the planning Act, which currently allows simultaneous applications to be made for certain quarry developments for both future development and substitute consent to An Bord Pleanála at the same time, so that simultaneous applications will be open to all types of development. Amendments are also proposed to section 34(12) of the Act which will require planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to screen an application for retention permission for EIA and AA, and refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised development where either EIA or AA are screened in. While we are considering this legislation, it is appropriate to mention the current situation at An Bord Pleanála. Recent revelations have resulted in a loss of public confidence in the organisation. I know the Minister has ordered an inquiry, which is currently under way. Of course we await its publication, but it is clear the issue of public confidence in the board must be addressed. It is critical that the public and stakeholders can have confidence and faith in our planning system. Ireland's international reputation is at stake. I look forward to measures being taken quickly to restore confidence when the inquiry concludes. As regards, this largely technical Bill, I thank the Minister and his officials for introducing the legislation. I hope it will streamline the process and deliver a more efficient planning system.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Tánaiste for introducing this legislation, which provides legal protection for workers in respect of tips and gratuities. It will mean any tips received cannot be counted towards an employee's basic pay; they must be counted as additional and separate. The treatment of tips and gratuities has been a long-standing issue that is regularly raised by employees and trade unions. Historically, all good employers left it to workers to make their own arrangements around tips. However, with the advent of card payments, particularly contactless payments during the Covid-19 pandemic, employers and management became involved in processing these payments. In some cases, the distribution of electronic tips was facilitated but in many establishments, tips paid by card could not be processed. There are also reports of tips and gratuities being included as part of basic wages by some unscrupulous employers, as referred to earlier. The aim of this Bill is to provide clarity on the meaning of tips, gratuities and service charges, to place tips and gratuities, but not service charges, outside the scope of a person's contractual wages, to oblige employers to display prominently their policy on the distribution of both cash and card payments and to oblige employers to distribute fairly, equitably and in a transparent manner tips that are received in an electronic form, that is, through debit or credit card payments or by way of smartphones. This will provide a legal basis and certainty for employees in respect of tips. It will also provide certainty to the public. When paying for a meal, especially when paying by card or smartphone, many people are unaware of how, or whether, tips and service charges are distributed among staff. Once this law is enacted, all employers will be required to show clearly how tips and service charges are dealt with in their businesses. This will provide clarity for both customers and staff. Most establishments already treat their employees fairly with regard to tips. For them, these provisions will mean no change beyond having to display their policy clearly, which is extremely welcome. People working in hospitality and other service sectors have made tremendous efforts during the pandemic to keep services going. In many cases, they did so at some risk to themselves and, indeed, their families. This Bill will provide legal protections in respect of tips and gratuities and it is very welcome. I thank the Tánaiste and his officials for introducing it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the summer economic statement. Clearly, we have a challenging period ahead. The Government was not found wanting when it came to supporting incomes, jobs and enterprise during the Covid-19 pandemic. People recognise that the pandemic was handled reasonably well. However, the increased cost of living is having an impact on their standard of living. Inflation has moved beyond energy prices and is now impacting core inflation rates. The budget needs to be framed with this in mind. We need to see an increases to social welfare and pension rates to match that of core inflation rates. These costs are unlikely to reduce over the medium to long term. Core inflation is running at about 4%, so we need to see a €10 to €15 per week increase in social welfare rates.  Energy costs are a slightly different matter. They may fall back next year or over the medium term if the war in Ukraine ends or as we shift to more renewable energies. However, this winter the cost of energy will be a major factor, particularly in Dublin were most households use natural gas. Wholesale gas prices are up to three times 2021 rates. If they stay at this level, people will be looking at significant energy bills.  It is disappointing in many respects that more was not done over the summer to prepare Ireland for the winter. Many of us in this House called for a national effort to insulate homes ahead of the winter. I have raised the need half a dozen times or more to provide solar panels for people with high energy use, for instance, those with medical needs, to help to defray some of the costs. Unfortunately, I have no progress to report. This window is rapidly closing and I ask the Minister and his colleagues in the various Departments to step in to provide significant support for those vulnerable households over the coming months. The fuel allowance should be topped up by way of a temporary enhancement. We need eligibility expanded and a second band introduced for people earning slightly above the current eligibility limits. Pensioners with a modest private pension and people on carer's allowance also need to be looked after. The eligibility threshold for carer’s allowance needs to be increased and a second band created to support working families. These families are at the pin of their collar and do not have the capacity to make ends meet. Even a second band with a half payment for households that are slightly above the income threshold would offer some relief to them. If this cannot be done, perhaps the criteria can be loosened for appeals. We need progress in this regard. It is not possible for many carers to seek other income opportunities.  I welcome the recent allocation of funding to increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by €100. This will give families some relief as they prepare to return to school. Again, this is something I have called for in the recent past. There will need to be a significant tax package in budget 2023. The relatively high rates of income tax for people with middle incomes needs to be addressed. These households are struggling to deal with the cost of inflation.Tax relief in the form of adjustments to the tax bands is badly needed. It is ridiculous that people are being pushed into the higher 40% bracket with earnings of just €36,800. The equivalent in the UK is £50,271. I would favour some relief on USC or PRSI bands to ensure they are indexed for workers on lower incomes so they are no worse off. Others have mentioned health and education. I will not repeat what has been said, other than to support the temporary uplift in grants to deal with energy costs. We also need to closely examine pre-budget submissions from groups such as the Irish Cancer Society, Age Action and Alone to ensure their reasonable policy suggestions are given adequate consideration in advance of budget 2023.  The budgetary position for Ireland is relatively positive. I agree with many of Deputy Bruton's comments regarding the outlook for the budget and the expectation around the preparation for it. We expect to run a surplus and there is scope to manage things well. We need to be prudent and focused about what we target and where we target resources. I favour changes tied to core inflation rates with generous but focused emergency uplifts to help people deal with those energy costs. The focus must be on working families, pensioners, carers, workers on modest incomes and peoples on the margins.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State, and the Deputy for raising the matter. He has been persistent on the issue.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Seanad Éireann has passed the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged By the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022 without amendment.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As the Tánaiste will be aware, I have raised issues relating to Go-Ahead Ireland in this House on previous occasions, including the poor quality of bus service it is providing to users in Dublin and across a wider area. My office is inundated with complaints about the company from the public. It is not just routes 111, 63, 59 and 75 in my area; there is a problem with the service throughout Dublin. Yesterday, for example, the 9.05 a.m service leaving Prosperous, County Kildare was cancelled and the 10.05 a.m. bus was full, leaving five people behind. The 4.23 p.m. bus leaving UCD at Belfield was cancelled for the third day in a row, leaving students stranded. This morning, the route 270 service from Dunboyne to Blanchardstown was cancelled. When commuters asked about the next service, they were told it was also cancelled. Everyone understands there will be issues on occasion but there seem to be cancelled services by Go-Ahead Ireland every day. We were initially told the reason was the Covid crisis and then that it was due to staffing and operational issues. Last week, there was a cyberattack and, today, it might be the rain. Whatever the reason, it is not acceptable. There are too many issues and they must be resolved. Will the Tánaiste raise this with the Minister for Transport?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and Deputy Lahart. I fully agree with his remarks. We now turn to the final Topical Issue matter of the day. I call Deputy Andrews.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I apologise. Deputy Nash should have 15 minutes to speak first.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I did call the Minister after Deputy Nash moved the Second Reading. The Minister will have 15 minutes to speak after Deputy Nash.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Not ours.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Dealing with the cost-of-living crisis is the top priority in budget 2023. The Government introduced a very significant €11 billion package on Tuesday to support households and businesses. The budget will continue to invest in public services, particularly our education, health, childcare and housing services, while increasing social protection and pension rates, supporting enterprise and delivering tax relief for working people. The €4.1 billion cost-of-living package is very welcome and necessary as we face into a challenging winter. In particular, I welcome: the €600 energy credit, which will be paid in three €200 instalments in November, January and March; the €1,000 tax credit for renters, €500 of which can be claimed this year and €500 next year; childcare fees being reduced by up to €2,100 per child; a double payment of child benefit in November; a double payment of welfare payments in October as well as the normal double payment at Christmas; a €500 grant for carers and those with disabilities; a €1,000 reduction in college fees for all students; major expansion of eligibility for the fuel allowance to bring more than 80,000 households into the system in January; fuel allowance to include a €400 lump sum; a working family payment to include a €500 lump sum; and a double SUSI payment in one month, paid in December. All of these are extremely welcome. Many colleagues spoke about them earlier and it is good to hear the members of the Opposition also welcome many of the measures. Of course, I cannot fail but mention the much-needed energy supports for the SMEs which require support over the next number of months, with up to €10,000 per month being offered there. Working families with one child will save up to €4,500. A working family, for instance, with three children, one of whom is in college, will see a saving of up to €5,640. A pensioner living alone in receipt of the State pension will see savings of up to €2,375, while a person with a disability living alone will see savings of up to €2,460. It is also recognised that the cost-of-living crisis will impact every household. The €600 electricity credit reflects this. This direct payment will assist households to manage their bills over the winter regardless of whether they use oil, gas or solid fuel to heat their homes. The significant adjustment of tax bands to ensure people earning under €40,000 do not have to pay tax at the higher rate is extremely welcome. This recognises the fact many people earning between €35,000 and €40,000 and above are not eligible for many social supports such as the housing assistance payment, HAP, and social housing. I welcome the permanent increases in social protection payments, such as the broad increase in core rates. The budget will make a real difference in people's lives. Moving beyond the direct payments, we can see improvements in other areas that will improve lives also. For instance, in education, the Minister, Deputy Foley, is rolling out free school books to all primary level schools. This will benefit 500,000 students and their parents next year.The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 23:1 recognises the challenges facing children after the disruption of Covid. It should be noted that this is the third year in a row of tackling the pupil-teacher ratio. An additional 686 special education teachers and an additional 1,194 special needs assistants, SNAs, will make a huge difference for children and the learning environment. Parents with children in childcare will see a saving of up to €2,106 per child, a real difference which will help parents. There is a massive investment in health too, with 6,000 new staff and the removal of hospital inpatient charges for public patients, worth €800 per patient. There is a €443 million package to reduce waiting lists and a €9 million package to reduce oral health waiting lists. Those changes will make a real difference for hundreds of thousands of people in need of such care. There is also investment in mental health. Students will benefit from the reduction in fees, the bonus SUSI payments, which I have referred to, and the permanent increases in grants from next year. In the few moments remaining to me, I will touch on just one issue the Opposition has raised, namely, the capping of energy rates. We need only look across the water and at what happened even today to see that borrowing rates are going through the roof and there are serious challenges facing that economy, challenges which could have an impact on our economy too. We have to be conscious that if we follow that route, we too could be impacted in that way.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Deputy. Before I call the Minister of State, in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she is generally here for the Topical Issue debate herself, as Deputy Cahill knows.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	That is a fair point.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Select Committee on Justice has completed its detailed scrutiny of the Ban on Sex for Rent Bill 2022 and, in accordance with Standing Order 178, has recommended that for the reasons outlined in its report, the Bill should not proceed to Committee Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, for taking this matter. I am disappointed that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, was not able to make it. I have raised this issue previously, most recently with the Tánaiste in this Chamber in September and at committee meetings last year. Specifically on the Go-Ahead bus service, my office is inundated with complaints from customers. It is not just the 63, 59, 45A, 111 or 75 routes in Dún Laoghaire; it is Go-Ahead bus services across the greater Dublin area. Just yesterday, for example, the 16.56 and the 17.38 services on the 18 route to Palmerstown were cancelled. On Monday, a woman was left to wait for more than an hour for the 17.05 service on the 175 route, which was cancelled. Another man was left waiting for more than an hour in Kilmacanogue because the 13.10, the 13.30 and the 13.50 bus services to Dún Laoghaire on the 45A route did not show up. When he contacted Go-Ahead, he was told that the 14.13 service was also being cancelled and that he would have to wait until 14.33. That is a wait of more than an hour and a half for a service that is meant to run every 20 minutes. It is completely unacceptable. I could list a dozen more examples from this week alone. As I said, I am disappointed that the Minister is not here to take this matter. I wonder if he is aware of how bad the Go-Ahead bus service has become and the significant impact this is having on people’s lives, particularly those of his constituents in Dublin Bay South. My Fianna Fáil colleagues across Dublin and I will continue to raise this issue until we see a resolution and an improvement in the Go-Ahead bus service.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for the update, the majority of which was contained in the response I received yesterday from the Department, which is welcome. A parallel I would draw is the issue of Go-Ahead experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences. We wish Covid on nobody but I do not understand how that company seems to have a worse number of cases of Covid than any other operator. It is having a serious impact on commuters. From the Minister's perspective, there is a kind of a hands-off approach to public transport in Dublin in particular, and that is leaving it to the NTA. That approach is not working. I contrast that with the issues during the summer at the Dublin Airport Authority, which the Minister of State herself worked on. That political pressure resolved the issues. Between the NTA and the Department, pressure needs to be applied to ensure we do not wait until Christmas. People have jobs to get to between now and Christmas and they need to get there on time and to have a reliable bus service. It is very important that this is done, and done quickly. Furthermore, if the issues continue in regard to Go-Ahead, I and Fianna Fáil colleagues like Deputy McAuliffe will be back again. People need safe, efficient, high-quality bus transport.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Staying with the topic of Irish Water, is the Tánaiste aware of the earthy-smelling and poor-tasting water that is being supplied to homes and business in the south Dublin-north Wicklow area? I understand that complaints relate to supplies from the Vartry water supply plant, which serves customers in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin city and north Wicklow. Irish Water has assured the public that the water supply is safe and properly treated. It says the smell is harmless, however, and it is investigating the issue. I ask the Tánaiste - I am not assuming he has a note on this matter today - to furnish the results of that investigation and discuss it with the Minister concerned.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Seanad Éireann has passed the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, without amendment.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has completed its consideration of the Tailte Éireann Bill 2022 and has made no amendments thereto.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I will give some latitude; it is Thursday.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	There are six minutes left.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	It is a Thursday as well.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	It is the leak.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	For the benefit of the other Deputies who are here for the Topical Issues debate, I will tap the bell when it gets to one minute so they are aware of the time. We are a little bit lost without the clocks.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Deputy did not. He had a sixth sense. That is what comes with experience.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Minister has four minutes.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	They are very welcome.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the VIPs in the Gallery. They are intrigued. It is lovely to have them here. I wonder if they know they will be on the record forever more. That is important.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Deputy took the words out of my mouth.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The next speaker is Deputy O'Reilly, who is sharing time with Deputy Quinlivan. Deputy O'Reilly has 15 minutes and Deputy Quinlivan has five minutes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Deputy should invite the whole House and we would all be there.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome this debate. As my party's spokesperson on Dublin, I welcome the need to improve safety, services and the environment in Dublin city and the wider Dublin region. Dublin is a world-class city with thousands of years of history and a rich architectural and social culture. Dublin should be a wonderful place to live and visit and most of the time it is. However, as other speakers have said, the welcoming atmosphere of Dublin has been overshadowed by antisocial and criminal behaviour by a small minority. Antisocial and criminal behaviour can have a devastating impact not only on the victims but on communities as well. Incidents of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable and can never become the norm. We all want people to be safe and feel safe living in the capital city and to be able to enjoy its amenities, activities and surrounds. Antisocial and criminal behaviour must be tackled with a multi-agency approach. We have heard many suggestions in this debate about how that can be done. Some Deputies have suggested it is for local government and others that it is for State agencies along with Departments. It will be for a myriad of those and more. Stakeholders include businesses as well as the local community themselves. I agree the current structures of Dublin are not working. There needs to be structural reform of local government, policing and other agencies to make them more effective. Fianna Fáil recently conducted a survey to assess the impact of antisocial and criminal behaviour on public transport users. We received 1,395 submissions. Some 83% of respondents indicated they did not feel safe on public transport. Taxis were perceived to be the safest form of public transport, with 60% of people who answered the question indicating they felt safe. The Luas was perceived to be the least safe mode of public transport with 49.8% of respondents indicating they did not consider it safe. The proportion of participants who indicated they had witnessed antisocial behaviour on public transport was 93%, with 53% indicating it was a regular occurrence. Some 26.4% of respondents reported incidents of antisocial behaviour but only 3.6% received a follow-up. This suggests 96% of those incidents went unreported. The proportion of participants who indicated they had been a victim of antisocial behaviour on public transport was 36%. That is a shocking figure for the level of public transport crime and intimidation. Some 78% of respondents indicated they favoured a dedicated Garda public transport unit and I support this too. A number of other Deputies indicated the same earlier, which is welcome. It seems there is going to unanimous support for this measure in the House. Garda members patrolling public transport services, particularly around hotspots of antisocial and criminal activity, would act as a deterrent, just as it does in other European cities. Many of those cities have dedicated public transport police units. The UK operates the British Transport Police, which is primarily funded by the public transport providers. I do not favour that model. The unit we are talking about should be a dedicated unit of An Garda Síochána. We recently met the new Garda assistant commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region, Angela Willis, to discuss the results of the survey and the general issue of anti-social behaviour in the capital. She agreed high-visibility policing is crucial and briefed us on her plans to expand that operation. That expansion has been announced in the form of Operation Citizen, which is very welcome. It involves targeting certain hotspots within the city, as well as reopening a Garda station presence on O'Connell Street that is set to be dedicated to the operation. The €5 million additional funding for Garda overtime provided by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in budget 2023 will support the expansion of high-visibility policing. However, there must also be a focus on community policing and youth diversion projects. The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, visited our local youth diversion project in Loughlinstown. These projects and their workers and volunteers are critical tools to support young people. Local sports clubs also play a critical role in supporting young people. I mention Monkstown Boxing Club. It was in the news recently because it had issues accessing its own training facilities in a community centre run by the council. I pay tribute to JP, Tommy, James, Darren and many others in the club who have brought it from strength to strength over the last number of years. The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently allocated significant grant funding to help clubs like Monkstown, but there needs to be urgent progress from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to ensure the club facility is built. Local representatives such as my colleague, Councillor Justin Moylan, will work closely with the club and officials to prevent that reoccurrence. I met Dublin Chamber earlier to discuss the issues its members perceive to be prominent within Dublin city and the greater Dublin area. There are challenges around the public realm. We saw many of these during the pandemic in particular. There is a lack of amenities in the core of the city centre, there are transport issues and crime, there is the night-time economy and the challenges it presents for businesses, shift workers and others and then there is planning and housing. There are a plethora of issues we could discuss. I do not want to be negative about Dublin city. There has been so much positive reform of the heart of the city but we as legislators must ensure we play our part in this Chamber, along with our colleagues on the council, to ensure the development plan is fit for purpose, enhances the city centre and makes it a more vibrant and inviting place than the headlines might lead you to believe. On the public realm, we have unfortunately seen an epidemic of plastic street clutter since the pandemic. The latter has brought its own challenges, especially when you look at the condition of some roads and footpaths that have fallen into disrepair. Local authorities must play their role in ensuring the rich architectural environment of our city, and indeed our county, are maintained. The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach and other Deputies mentioned the problems with taxis. Difficulties with Free Now and the lack of availability of taxis are real issues facing the city centre and have been going on for months. As we head into the Christmas period, nobody wants to see people being stranded. The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach highlighted the particular issues with females feeling unsafe in the city and if there are no taxis available that presents its own challenges and must be avoided. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, for being here for the debate and ask him to raise that with his colleagues at the Department of Transport. It is a very important issue. There are many issues we wish to see addressed for Dublin city. As I said, I do not want to be negative and there have been plenty of good things done and good initiatives taken. During Hallowe'en we saw various initiatives being undertaken by the city council to encourage good community spirit and a positive experience of Hallowe'en. That is to be welcomed and applauded. It needs to be expanded across all other local authorities. This debate is welcome and timely, given the challenges we have faced in the city and greater Dublin area over the last while. I ask the Minister of State to raise those various issues with his colleagues in the Government.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the members of the Hillery family, particularly Professor Hillery's wife, Miriam, to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. The late Professor Brian Hillery served, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, as a Deputy for the constituency of Dún Laoghaire between 1989 and 1992. It is wonderful to have so many of the Hillery family with us today. This is the 85th anniversary of Professor Hillery's birth. Brian James Hillery was born on 22 November 1937 at the family home in Miltown Malbay, County Clare, to a strong Fianna Fáil family. He attended school locally before going to St. Flannan’s College in Ennis for his secondary education. He then took a bachelor of commerce degree from UCD. After graduation he worked with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, in Dublin, before winning a Rotary scholarship to the University of Georgia in 1965, where he earned his master of business administration, MBA. A distinguished academic, he joined the faculty in UCD in 1967, where he became the first professor of industrial relations in 1974. He was called upon several times during that time to help mediate several disputes, of which there were many. Widely published, he was visiting professor in industrial relations at the University of California, Berkeley, in spring 1977 and also a guest lecturer at the University of Warwick and the Wharton School. Professor Hillery married Miriam Davy in 1970. She is the daughter of the distinguished Irish rugby player, Eugene Davy. Together, Brian and Miriam had five children, Conor, Eugene, Cliona, Brian Patrick and Gavin. I welcome them, along with his sister, Joan, his brother, Tommy, and all the extended Hillery family, to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. Brian and Miriam celebrated their golden 50th wedding anniversary on 18 July 2020. As the Taoiseach said, Miriam was a determined supporter and adviser to Brian who travelled the country with him and ensured his election to the Seanad in 1977 and 1983. With her support, he was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1987 to represent the Dún Laoghaire constituency, alongside former Deputy and Minister, David Andrews, in an exceptionally competitive and exciting campaign with former councillor and cathaoirleach of the county, Betty Coffey, which members still recall 35 years later. That tells us how exciting that was. Professor Hillery was appointed by the Taoiseach to the Seanad in 1993, where he served until 1994 when he stepped down as a Senator to take up an appointment as executive director of the EBRD, representing Ireland and Denmark until 1997.In later years he had a distinguished business career, serving as a director of many public and private entities while continuing his long history of public service as a director of the Central Bank and financial service regulator as well as chairman of the Independent News and Media, in which role, it has to be said, his mediation skills were called upon yet again. Speaking to colleagues who served with Brian here in the Oireachtas, they always remember him as a warm, intelligent and courteous parliamentarian, great company and a man who made a distinguished contribution in his life. On behalf of all the members of Fianna Fáil in Dún Laoghaire, I extend our deepest sympathy to the Hillery family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Social Welfare Bill 2022, which gives effect to the changes announced in budget 2023 as announced by the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, on 27 September last. This cost-of-living budget will help families to cope with the impact of rising costs of living. There is no trickle-down side to this. There will be a direct and substantial aid to those most in need. This month alone will see people on half a dozen schemes receive lump-sum payments such as the €400 cost-of-living fuel allowance payment to all households getting the fuel allowance, the €200 cost-of-living lump-sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the living alone allowance, the €500 cost-of-living lump-sum to all families getting the working family payment, the double payment of child allowance to support all families with children, the €500 cost-of-living lump-sum payment for people getting the carer's support grant as well as the €500 cost-of-living lump-sum disability support grant which will be paid to all people getting a long-term disability payment. The single biggest measure, costing nearly €900 million, is the permanent increase in the social welfare payment of €12 - the largest ever increase in these payments and part of the largest ever social protection package. In Fianna Fáil, we reject the Opposition's proposal to give less to pensioners. Pensioners deserve our support and we will continue to oppose the idea that they should be treated unequally. These increases will apply to all people who receive a principal social welfare payment. More people will qualify for the working family payment, the qualified child allowance and the fuel allowance, which is being increased, as are the payments to carers and people on CE schemes. Of course, this is on top of benefiting from the other once-off measures addressing inflation which I have mentioned. The one-off payments to people are welcome and necessary. I will single out one change as important. The expansion of the fuel allowance scheme to people over 70 years of age is extremely significant. A couple over 70 with an income of up to €1,000 per week will be eligible for fuel allowance for the first time ever from January 2023. This significant change will benefit thousands of households, not only in my constituency in Dún Laoghaire but across Ireland. I raised this issue of people with a modest pension being locked out of the fuel allowance scheme during the summer, when I called for that threshold to be increased. I thank the Minister and her colleagues in government for taking that suggestion on board. I would ask that a publicity campaign be launched to ensure that people are aware of this significant change and that there is sufficient staff within the Department to deal with the increased volume of applications that no doubt will follow. It is important that people get that. Finally, I join my colleagues in expressing concern about the community welfare office system. Recent changes have led to community welfare officers being one step further removed from the individuals who are most in need of financial support. Emergency appointments are extremely hard to obtain for people. Those physically present in the community welfare offices are not dealing with a much larger volume of calls, callers or those seeking their assistance. Certainly, the recent changes need to be evaluated to ensure we keep that kind of direct contact. All public representatives in this House are receiving a higher volume of requests from people who are in dire straits of various different degrees, be it financial or otherwise, and need to avail of the community welfare office system, which is a fantastic system. We need to ensure it is front-facing and welcoming to those most in need.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the recent revelations of abuse in schools by the Spiritan Order. The details of the abuse and its handling by the order are deeply disturbing. It is heart-breaking to see so many people impacted across all the order's schools and through so many generations. It is important to remember that crimes have been committed and should be investigated by the An Garda Síochána. This process must not be compromised. I am conscious of this while discussing this matter today. However, given that many of the individuals accused of abuse are deceased, it will be for another form of investigation to deliver transparency and accountability for the victims. Earlier this month, the Spiritan congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers, disclosed that 233 men have made allegations of abuse against 77 Irish Spiritans in Ireland and overseas. Of that number, 57 men have alleged they were abused on the campus of Blackrock College and Willow Park in Dublin.The number of people who have made allegations of abuse at Spiritans schools has since risen to almost 300. The Spiritans run three other colleges in Dublin, St. Mary’s College in Rathmines, Templeogue College and St. Michael’s College, as well as Rockwell College in Tipperary. I have been struck by the courage of the survivors who have spoken out, particularly David and Mark Ryan, as well as John Coulter, Corry McMahon, Louis Hoffman and Philip Feddis. I thank the former pupils of Blackrock College and Willow Park for their engagement over the past few weeks. It has been extremely difficult for the individuals who have come forward, those who have yet to come forward and those who may never do so. This is traumatising for those who have been victims of abuse at any stage of their lives. I know they have been stunned by the extent of the abuse, with groups meeting up as far away as Sydney to discuss the situation. There is a deep sadness and outrage among these groups about what their fellow pupils have endured. They are clear there is a need for transparency and for the truth to come out. They have questions about how this could have gone on unabated for such a long period. There is concern about how individuals with a history of abuse could have been in positions of authority in Willow Park well into the 1990s. It is clear the Spiritans were aware of the situation. They need to provide transparency around their handling of the abuse and the perpetrators. Parents, equally, have been shocked by the extent of the abuse. Many worked hard to send their boys to Willow Park and Blackrock College. It is important to identify the most effective way to conduct an inquiry while ensuring it is survivor-centred at every stage. I welcome the Minister's comments and the Taoiseach's assurances on this. It is also important to consider previous inquiries, statutory and non-statutory, and the lessons we can take from these, including in respect of length of time, findings and challenges. We have seen a number of formats for inquires into historical sexual abuse over the past 20 years in this country. The Ferns report, for example, was presented to the Government in October 2005 and was the result of a non-statutory inquiry established by the then Minister for Health and Children. The report identified over 100 allegations of child sexual abuse against 21 priests made in the period 1962 to 2002. It also set out a number of recommendations which have since been implemented. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was a statutory inquiry that presented its report, known as the Ryan report, in 2009, after ten years of work. The commission consisted of two committees, a confidential committee for those who wished to tell their story and an investigative committee with powers to investigate. The confidential committee heard testimony from more than 1,000 people who had experienced sexual and other forms of abuse. The full implementation of the Ryan report’s recommendations will be completed with the establishment of a national centre for remembrance and research, which will contain a national archive of historical records relating to institutional trauma in the 20th century. The Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin was established on a statutory basis in 2006 and its report, the Murphy report, was published shortly after the Ryan report in 2009. It examined over 320 complaints of child sex abuse by Dublin clergy and how these allegations were handled by the church and State authorities. The Commission of Investigation into the Catholic diocese of Cloyne was established on a statutory basis in March 2009. Its report was published in July 2011 and examined how allegations of sexual abuse of children against 19 priests in the diocese of Cloyne were dealt with by the church and the State authorities. The report of the interdepartmental committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen laundries, also known as the McAleese report, was published in 2013. The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes was established in 2015 to provide an account of what happened to women and children in mother and baby homes during the period 1922 to 1998. Its final report was published in January 2021. We are all aware of the difficulties with the report published by that commission. The extended nature of some of the inquiries needs to be considered, as noted by colleagues across the House today. It is important that any inquiry would produce a report in a reasonable timeframe, giving consideration to the needs of victims. It is also important to note that very strong child safeguarding procedures exist in all schools, the Department of Education and the Garda. Reflecting on the revelations, I note the motto of Blackrock College, "Faith and Strength". It is clear the survivors of abuse at the college have shown great strength and courage in coming forward. It is imperative that the Government and authorities work with the survivors and their families to deliver truth, transparency and accountability. The staff, pupils and wider school community in Willow Park and Blackrock College have been there to support each other and discuss these horrific revelations but it is imperative that we try to establish a conclusive inquiry with the victims at the centre to ensure we uncover the truth, that justice is served and that this is done speedily.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I am sure he will not criticise Deputy Bruton.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I welcome the opportunity to examine the outcome of the most recent UN Conference of the Parties that was held in Sharm El-Sheikh from 6 to 20 November. I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier update on the conference. I congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on their work at COP27. I particularly welcome the Taoiseach's comments about the need for urgent delivery and a swift transition. The breakthrough at the conference to support least developed countries through a loss and damage fund is particularly welcome. Island nations such as Vanuatu, as referenced by the Taoiseach earlier, are at extreme risk as are people across Africa and Southeast Asia. It is important that developed countries support these nations as they transition to net zero. While the full details of the loss and damage fund are to be finalised, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to ensure that the fund includes very robust controls to ensure the monies are directed to those most in need.Here in Ireland, the focus must be on a fast transition and we need to see far more urgency in areas like solar, retrofitting and upgrading the public transport network.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will be aware that I have raised in the past his own suggestion that solar panels be installed on the homes of people obliged to use additional energy as a consequence of a medical illness. Unfortunately, progress has been far too slow in this regard. Likewise, there has been slow progress on ensuring people with solar panels can sell surplus power back to the grid.  I would like to see further action on shallow and full retrofits. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire, the retrofitting of council homes is moving far too slow and it will take 50 years to retrofit the 4,500 units there.  As I have raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, equally in the past, we need to see an accelerated roll-out of improvements to public transport services, particularly in Dublin, with a continued focus on rail and Luas extensions. These projects are critical for the new communities being developed as part of the Housing for All programme.  Unfortunately, my time is limited here today but I also would have liked to touch on wind power, forestry and food security. I welcome the additional funding announced in announced in budget 2023. It is clear that funding is available. Now we need to see delivery as neither Ireland nor the world cannot wait.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware that the Garda and private security organisations have been calling for the introduction of body cameras to improve safety and transparency.The general data protection regulation and other data protection rules, regulations and related guidelines limit or prohibit the use of body cameras. There was some revised guidance from the data protection officer recently. However, uncertainties remain and primary legislation is required. Will the Taoiseach advise as to when he expects Second Stage of the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 to be taken? Will he ask the Minister for Justice to examine extending the use of body cameras to private security staff?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Seanad Éireann has passed the Water Services (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022, without amendment. Seanad Éireann has passed the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2022, without amendment.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Select Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2022: Votes 26 and 45.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	We are under time constraints.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Through the Chair.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Go raibh maith agat, a Theachta.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The next session will be questions to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. While we await his arrival, I welcome our guests to the Visitors Gallery. Good morning to everybody. You are all very welcome. There were other visitors during the debate earlier, too. It is great to have so many visitors to the House today. It is an historic day, with the President of the European Commission coming to address the House, which is why the rostrum is here beside me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister is aware that many doctors signed up to category A consultant contracts during the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic. Alongside their colleagues in the health sector they were on the front line throughout the pandemic. We in the House are extremely grateful for all of their efforts. Will the Minister provide an update on the progress to date of the incremental credit applications for these doctors? I know this issue is somewhat complex and has been going on for quite some time but they would be very grateful for any indication of when it is expected to be finalised.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has completed its consideration of the Local Government (Maternity Protection and Other Measures for Members of Local Authorities) Bill 2022 and has made no amendments thereto.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	First and foremost, I thank Deputy Bacik for bringing forward this Bill. Having heard what the Minister said on the collaboration that is going to happen from here on with this, it is important to bring into focus the issues that many of the Deputies have spoken about today and the need for us to work as a collective of Deputies representing all coastal constituencies across Dublin, and indeed those who do not but who have a great affinity with the amenity of Dublin Bay. I acknowledge and thank the SOS Dublin Bay group, among others. My colleague mentioned Flossie and the Beach Cleaners, an organisation that has done fantastic work along the coast, as has Ms Margaret Brown, founder of Sandycove Tidy Towns, and others. My constituency colleague Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the late Bob Waddell, who passed away, sadly, in January 2019. He was exceptionally good at communicating with all local representatives. His input into various community organisations is missed. Turning to the Bill itself, I note that section 4 states the authority will "propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment of Dublin Bay and of the natural habitats and wildlife in and around the Bay". As was said and as was alluded to by the Minister, a vast number of water quality notices are issued. Speaking as a representative of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I can say that it is frequent, particularly at this time of year, that water notices are issued and swimming is prohibited, unfortunately. As others have highlighted, swimming has become very popular. It became popular before the pandemic, but there has certainly been an explosion of interest and use of Dublin Bay since then. Deputy Bacik told us about her swimming group that meets regularly. There are many other such groups, some of which are formal. I know of groups in Sandycove, the Forty Foot, as well as in Killiney, Sandymount and Seapoint in my own area. There are many groups and the interest is there. Obviously, there is huge frustration when we see these poor water quality notices being issued, many of which are avoidable, and the impact they have on swimmers and people. While I welcome the €6 billion investment, there are still challenges that remain. It is not just purely about the waste treatment centres and the treatment of run-off from roads. There are a whole range of issues. We have spoken about the Dublin Bay biosphere. Mr. Dean Eaton was mentioned by Deputy Andrews. When I was on the council, Mr. Eaton was an employee of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and went on to work as Dublin Bay biosphere co-ordinator. He and his colleagues have a great passion for their work. The work they are doing is extremely commendable and is important for raising awareness. I note that in the proposed Bill the aim is to promote and support the strategic planning and sustainable development in and around Dublin Bay as well as promoting the various benefits of the bay. What is also important about the proposal around the Dublin Bay authority is how that organisation or structure is formed. That will be teased out on Committee Stage. We obviously have to be aware of the EU directives in place. That is known and recognised by all concerned. Ultimately, we want to work collectively with the various volunteers who have a great passion and love for the area and who have really championed this, to give them their due. We also want to ensure that, as political representatives, we bring together the various organisations and agencies involved, of which there are many, as the Minister alluded to earlier. We need to ensure the local authorities and the various agencies are working in tandem with each other to ensure we bring forward some mechanism to improve water quality all year round. I welcome that the Minister is committed to ensuring we get real-time information. That is sorely lacking. At the moment, there are some people who are not aware of the prohibitions that are in place. Swimmers have to search for that information before they go swimming. The information should be readily available. The results of all-year round testing should also be made public for the various bathing areas. Deputy Bacik has done a great service by ensuring we, as the Oireachtas, are examining what can be done for Dublin Bay to improve water quality, the benefits of which will be felt not only by those who swim in the but also by the rich biodiversity in our bay. I welcome the Bill and look forward to it progressing to Committee Stage shortly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is one of the last Taoiseach's questions in this Dáil term. We are now 12 sleeps away from Christmas. Many children, having written their letters to Santa, are anxiously awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus. I know Santa, Mrs. Claus and all the elves are very busy making all of the presents and the arrangements for them to be delivered across the world. Can the Taoiseach confirm that arrangements are in place for Santa and reindeer to enter Irish airspace on Christmas Eve? It is a tough question for the Taoiseach on his last day taking Taoiseach's questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Budget 2023 delivered significant emergency support to cushion households from the worst affects of the energy crisis. One key welcome change was the expansion of eligibility limits for the fuel allowance payment for people over 70 years. The income threshold for those over 70 years has been increased to €1,000 a week. That is a significant and very welcome improvement to the scheme. I thank the Taoiseach and the Minister for making this important change. Will the Taoiseach commit to asking the Minister to arrange for a publicity campaign to let people know about the positive change coming into affect in January?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Before the Minister responds, I call Deputy Durkan on the same issue.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	The Minister will have another minute to respond.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine and discuss the Human Tissue (Transplantation, post mortem, Anatomical Examination and Public Display) Bill this evening. This landmark legislation includes provisions around organ donation and transplantation, post mortem practice and procedures in hospital settings, anatomical examinations, and public display of bodies after death. The Bill will support organ donation and transplantation in Ireland and aims to make organ donation the norm in situations where the opportunity arises, thereby helping to increase the pool of organ donation here in Ireland. The proposed Bill will ensure the principles of protection of the bodily integrity of the individual before and after death. It enshrines respect for the dignity and autonomy of the individual, and the rights of the bereaved are enshrined in legislation. It will make consent for non-coronial post mortems compulsory and it will improve communication and information-sharing with families for all post mortems, including those conducted under the direction of the coroner. I welcome the proposed regulations around transplants. I thank the Minister and the Government for bringing this forward. This issue has been long discussed, not only in this House but in the other Chamber, the Upper House of the Oireachtas. I want, in particular, to put on the record my appreciation of Senator Mark Daly, who has been proposing such legislation for nearly a decade now. He, too, would also warmly welcome the progress of this Bill through the House. It is important to note that families will still be consulted ahead of donation and those individuals who object, for whatever reason, will be able to opt out, something the Minister highlighted very well in his opening remarks. The principle of consent is at the centre of this Bill. Transplantation is currently the only available treatment for end-stage heart, lung and liver failure. It is also the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage kidney disease, and it brings enormous clinical and social benefits to patients who would otherwise remain on dialysis. Last year, about 250 people had life-saving transplants. It is hoped the provisions of this Bill will help save more lives by providing for the first time a national legislative framework to support donation and transplant services in Ireland, helping to increase that donor pool. The legalisation introduces an opt-out approach. This will allow anyone to opt out of the scheme. It is important to note that families can also opt out if they would prefer their loved one’s organs are not donated for any reason.  The Bill will also introduces a new regulatory regime to ensure best practice is followed in respect of post mortem and organ retention. We have seen a number of scandals in this area, again highlighted by the Minister, with tissue being retained for years without the knowledge or consent of families. This was particularly distressing where the tissue and organs of babies were retained without the consent of mothers and fathers. This Bill will introduce regulations in this area, which are very welcome. The Bill also repeals the Anatomy Act 1832 and puts in place arrangements for the donation of bodies to anatomy schools together with provisions for the setting of standards to be met in the practice of anatomy. The new legislation also deals with the public display of deceased individuals, something which is not legislated for here in Ireland. It will require a licence for public exhibition. This will not impact funeral arrangements or religious ceremonies when someone is in repose, but is aimed at events such as the Real Bodies exhibition, which displays human remains to the public. I thank not only the Minister for bringing forward this legislation in a timely fashion in this current term of the Dáil but also the officials and many campaign groups which have been in contact with all Deputies across this House over many years, pressing to bring this very important and very welcome legislation forward.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to start by congratulating and wishing my colleague, Deputy McGrath, well in his new role and thanking him for all of the work he did in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I also want to formally congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, and wish her well in her new role. Turning to the question, I would like the Minister to outline his plans to undertake a review of the income tax system here, as committed to in the programme for Government. A Commission on Taxation and Welfare report was published in September of last year, entitled Foundations for the Future, taking a medium-term to long-term view of taxation in this country and I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on same.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister and commend him in particular on the work done in relation to the tax credits and the tax bands. The programme for Government commits specifically to developing a circular economy and legislation in that area is being progressed, as the Minister knows. The structural shift to a circular economy should be supported with taxation changes to support labour intensive sectors that underpin the repair of goods, particularly consumer goods, and retrofitting, in addition to the traditional labour intensive sectors such as tourism, hairdressing, and personal services such as home care, which will be needed to support an ageing population. Conversely, VAT and other taxes on IT and automated services should be reviewed to ensure that they are fit for purpose and effective in the modern era. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate the Minister's response and look forward to working with him and his officials over the coming months, particularly in relation to the base reform, PRSI, the tax credit system, USC and the income bands. I am sure we will flesh all of that out over the coming months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome today's discussion and debate around the opportunity to further analyse and scrutinise the new national forestry programme announced on 3 November 2022. I acknowledge the massive €1.3 billion investment in forestry, particularly for rural communities, secured by my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett. The forestry programme will help us to achieve many of Ireland's national environmental priorities. Forestry has a crucial role to play in meeting Ireland's climate targets, as well as addressing the decline in biodiversity. The recent national debate around Coillte has raised important concerns and questions about how we implement this new forestry programme. Coillte was established in 1988 as a semi-State commercial business. The organisation employs approximately 900 people and manages about half of the forested land in Ireland. While commercial forestry and the production of lumber for construction will be critical into the future to assist us to meet our climate obligations, national priorities around forestry have changed and Coillte's objectives must also change. As noted by other speakers, Ireland must increase forest cover by approximately 400,000 ha by 2050, as set out in the forestry programme. It is critical that at least half of this afforestation is in the form of native woodland. There is public benefit to this, which must be recognised by Coillte. The Coillte-Gresham House deal about which we have spoken at length today involves the planting of 3,500 ha for new forestry out of an overall objective of 400,000 ha. I understand the background to this deal cited by Coillte around EU state aid rules but I have concerns about the concentration of land ownership and the impact this would have on rural communities. If the deal cannot be reversed, it is clear from listening to colleagues, constituents and stakeholders that we do not want to see this format expanded. I welcome the commitment from the Minister that Coillte will re-engage with farming communities. Farmers should be at the heart of our forestry programme. It is essential, as Deputy Farrell referenced, that there is buy-in from farmers to attract people to afforestation. Increased subsidies are justified, particularly where there is public access to land and biodiversity is improved. I welcome today's debate. The national conversation that is taking place around forestry and the role of landowners and their inclusion is important. Now that the debate is happening, there is greater awareness around the role of Coillte and its intentions in respect of the forestry programme. The programme is essential. There have been calls in this House for a programme for a number of years. The Government has brought forward this plan. It is relatively new. I know the Minister and the Ministers of State are engaging and listening to various groups and stakeholders, which is important. I await the Minister's response.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware of the case of Bernard Phelan, an Irish citizen imprisoned in Iran. Bernard was born in Clonmel and raised in Blackrock, in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. He was arrested on 3 October last year and is one of a number of European citizens being held in Iran. I understand that Bernard has cardiac and other medical conditions. His elderly father and his family are extremely concerned for his health and well-being. I have raised this matter with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs but I would be grateful if the Taoiseach could raise it directly with President Ebrahim Raisi.
CormacDevlin	An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Deputy for that. Before we go to the Minister of State, I welcome the boys and girls from the primary school in the Gallery this morning. They are all very welcome to the House. There were a number of chuckles during the Deputy's contribution so I think there is agreement up there in the Gallery. I call the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.
CormacDevlin	An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Deputy Joan Collins was going to share time with Deputy Fitzmaurice. She now has ten minutes herself. Is that correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is Deputy Ó Cathasaigh.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Bill. The Minister will be aware that I raised this issue on several occasions in the past year. I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which has long been sought by gardaí and their representative associations. The Bill provides for the use of body-worn cameras by gardaí and the expanded use of ANPR technology. It also contains provisions relating to CCTV footage and the recording of phone calls. It is essential that good oversight of data protection be initiated from the outset. Body-worn cameras are widely used across the EU as an effective tool for evidence gathering in the investigation of crime. They can protect both the public and gardaí. The Bill does not deal with the usage of body-worn cameras by private security firms. The sector is eager for action in this area to provide protection for its staff and members of the public. I hope that matter will be examined in the near future. I thank An Garda for its efforts to prevent and investigate crime and antisocial behaviour. It is not an easy job and Garda members are on the front line. They place themselves at risk on our behalf every day. I am sure all parties across the House are grateful for their efforts and service. Thanks is not enough, however. As an Oireachtas, we need to provide legislation to support front-line gardaí. This Bill legislating for body cameras is such a measure. I welcome the commitment of the Government to enact this year the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will increase the maximum penalty for the offence of assault causing harm, from five years' imprisonment to ten. However, further action from the Minister is required to deal with the attacks on gardaí and first responders. Mandatory minimum sentences should be introduced. There should be no tolerance for attacks on members of An Garda Síochána, the fire brigade, the ambulance service and other first responders in our society.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Taoiseach will be aware the programme for Government commits to dealing with asylum applications as quickly as possible to ensure people seeking international protection here do not have to endure long delays to have their cases assessed or determined. Given the significant increase in applications over the past 12 months, it is clear the Immigration Service Delivery, the International Protection Office and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, will need extra resources. For example, I understand that IPAT fees to barristers determining the appeals have not changed since 2011 and this may have an impact on recruiting sufficiently qualified personnel for that. Will the Taoiseach advise what measures are being taken to support these institutions which are responsible for determining these cases?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the treatment of historical nursing home charges and disability allowance payments. I might focus on the nursing home charges first. As I understand it, this issue originally arose out of the Health Act 1970, which granted people with a medical card free access to inpatient services. This was later determined to include long-stay nursing home care. However, in 1976, the then health boards withdrew medical cards for those in long-term care. This resulted in those patients and their families making contributions for long-term care between 1976 and 2004. In 2004, the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, introduced the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 in an attempt to resolve the issue. However this Bill was referred to the Supreme Court. The court found patients who had been unlawfully charged for services had the right under Article 43 of the Constitution, which deals with private property, and Article 40.3.2°, which deals with the vindication of rights, to sue to recover damages. In its judgment, the court found that elements of the Bill represented an unjust attack on the property rights of individuals and therefore were repugnant to the Constitution. However, in its judgment the court only dealt with patients in public care homes. The court did not deal with medical card patients or people eligible for a medical card who could not secure a bed in a public facility and had to go to private nursing home care. In response, the then Government introduced the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 to provide a legal basis for the repayment of long-stay charges which had been imposed on persons with full eligibility since 1976, that is, those persons who had a medical card or who were entitled to a medical card and in a public facility. The scheme entitled people in a public facility since 1998 who were still alive in December 2004 to recoup payments back to 1998, that is, within the six-year Statue of Limitations. Estates were given similar status. The HSE was also given power to reclaim funds to third-party institutions for people in their care with no families. The deadline for submitting claims under the health repayment scheme was 31 December 2007. I understand approximately 35,000 applications were received under the health repayment scheme and almost 20,000 claimants received a repayment. This issue arose at the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member last week where we engaged with the HSE on this matter. A total of €486 million was paid out, with an average repayment of approximately €22,000. As I previously noted, the repayment scheme did not make provision for medical card patients, or those with eligibility who could not secure a bed in a public facility and had to go to access a private nursing home. Individuals and their families who accessed private nursing home care during the period from 1976 to 2004, had to take legal action if they wished to press their case. I understand proceedings were issued in a number of cases. In each instance, it has been reported the case was settled at discovery stage. We have advice from the Attorney General now that defends previous Government policy in dealing with the cases. The issue raises important questions, however, about the rights of vulnerable individuals and their families and the need for the State to protect the public purse to safeguard funds to provide important services. I understand almost all historical cases have been settled at this stage and the health repayment scheme is close to winding down. Of course, the fair deal scheme deals with the current arrangements. We all engage with that on a regular basis. In these circumstances, the issue is one of examining how we deal with current and future instances of citizens' access to courts and how the State vindicates the citizens' rights. Personally, I believe an ex-gratia or administrative scheme would have been fair but I recognise this issue came to a head from 2009 to 2011, a period when public funding was extremely tight. Notwithstanding this, it is important the State examines how it treats citizens and service users right across its Departments and agencies. A stand-alone inquiry is not required but it should be dealt with as part of a wider exercise. We need to provide additional funding to the Office of the Ombudsman. On another committee of which I am a member, we deal with the Ombudsman's office on a regular basis. Some of its staff would highlight the fact that there is a need to broaden their scope somewhat. This case highlights that need clearly. We also need to overhaul civil legal aid to support citizens and service users who wish to vindicate their rights. I appreciate the Minister's attendance here today. I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will make closing remarks. There have been discussions and debate, both in this House and outside, over the past couple of weeks on this sensitive issue. It is one that people obviously feel strongly about. I welcome the candid nature of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in terms of dealing with this issue. It is not easy looking back on historical issues, as we know in this House all too well. Nonetheless, the Minister and the Minister of State are determined to see it through and to ensure that there is a more transparent way in future for those who are in those positions. Obviously, legislation itself has changed, which is most welcome.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the opportunity to examine the Civil Defence Bill 2023, which will replace the current suite of laws relating to Civil Defence. The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure a modern and comprehensive legislative basis for Civil Defence matters. Currently, the legislative basis for Civil Defence comprises the Air-Raid Precautions Acts 1939 and 1946 and the Civil Defence Act 2012. The current suite of legislation dating back to the 1940s does not adequately reflect the current role of Civil Defence and, consequently, there is a requirement for new legislation. The White Paper on Defence in 2015 set out the need to replace the existing legislation and to provide for more modern legislation governing Civil Defence matters. The White Paper also stated that the future of Civil Defence will continue to be developed around its central strategic objective of supporting the principal response agencies, that is, An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and local authorities, in a variety of emergency and non-emergency situations.The Civil Defence was established in 1951 and its volunteers have played a prominent role in supporting front-line responders during significant emergencies such as Covid-19 most recently, Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001, and the Stardust tragedy in 1981 in which 48 people lost their lives. I pay tribute to the many volunteers of the Civil Defence, both past and present. It is a remarkable organisation. I acknowledge in particular the volunteers from my constituency of Dún Laoghaire who play an active role in supporting the Garda, the Irish Coast Guard, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, and the local authority. They were prominent during the Covid-19 response, and also during significant events and tragedies, such as fires within the county, incidents at sea and regular community events such as the Kilbogget community run. I highlight, thank and recognise Lar Griffin of the Dún Laoghaire Civil Defence for his work and that of his colleagues who do tremendous work in our area. Civil Defence volunteers are at the heart of all communities. They have a proud history and they should be supported in their work. This Bill provides for a modern and comprehensive legislative basis for Civil Defence matters. It is welcome but it must be underpinned with financial and budgetary supports. I look forward to seeing those in the next budget.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I nominate Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Close for his remarks. He raised two issues. He said that there is the certification of the UK institutions in the area of F-gases and also referred to the free-of-charge process to convert to the Irish, EU certificate. Is there any difference between the two certifications? What volume of applications has Mr. Close seen to date for the Irish certification?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for attending. I have several questions on the opening statements. I will start with Dr. Ryall, who mentioned the Climate Change Advisory Council and its need for independence and oversight. She touched earlier on the ideal composition of the council and the importance of funding it. However, she might elaborate on the issue of its make-up. With regard to Ireland's climate action Bill, when it is ultimately adopted, how would she see it intertwine or complement our EU obligations? I will have questions for Dr. Torney next.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Ryall. I have two questions for Dr. Torney and, as our time is limited, he might come back to me on these. First, he referenced the draft text of 2015 and said there were pieces missing from it. I heard both witnesses state there should be some sort of attachment or document, separate to all of this, for the public's engagement with it. He might elaborate on what he has come across that is missing. Second, in terms of setting climate targets, would he propose setting targets for specific sectors within the economy and could those sectors offset their targets to other sectors?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman for allowing this second round. How broad should the just transition be, in the opinions of both witnesses, to protect those on low incomes? There is a fear of these targets and of changes to public policy on climate change, particularly among those on low incomes or of limited means.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As I have not spoken before, I shall start with Professor Sweeney who referred to the UK Act in his opening statement. I ask him to elaborate on the big differences between what is proposed in this Bill and what the UK has adopted. The professor referred to language in his opening remarks and one of his observations recommended the use of the sentence, "The State shall achieve the transition to a climate resilient and climate neutral economy by the end of the year 2050". I understand the reason for his recommendation as it would bind future Governments to decisions. What happens when targets are met and achieved?  Dr. Jackson referred to the Climate Change Advisory Council. Who does he suggest should make up the CCAC?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their testimony, for highlighting various aspects of the Bill and for their own experiences. The debate has been very interesting. By this point many of the questions have been asked so forgive me for any repetition.I was taken with the point in the opening statements about the need to tighten up the language in the Bill. Both witnesses spoke about that in some detail. In terms of the differences between what is being proposed here and what the UK has done given its experience in climate action for nearly 12 years, what are the main differences between what is being proposed here and the witnesses' lived experiences of what the UK has introduced?  Mr. Church spoke about the indications of the carbon budget not being met and it was only two years away. What sanctions are built into that Act? What implications will it have for the UK Government if those targets are not met?  In his opening statement, Dr. Muinzer spoke about the UK Act and its performance and involvement. We heard about the need to tighten up the language in the Bill before us, the commitments in that Bill, its impact on future Governments and the sanctions it could bring. Deputy Sherlock asked about the role of local councils. That is an important element when one is speaking about the impact it will have on local authorities. Regarding the advisory committee about which both witnesses spoke, what kind of make-up should it have? Would it have members from youth and community groups? I think both witnesses spoke about the Dutch and Scottish models. Could they delve into the advisory councils in the Netherlands and Scotland and how they possibly differ from each other or which has the better make-up? Mr. Church spoke about public participation in the Netherlands as an example of best practice. Was that on a continuous basis or was it at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Professor FitzGerald's opening statement referred to the composition of the council. He said that in addition to any formal qualifications, members need to be people who have qualities of judgement and independence. Other witnesses have spoken of their experience of other advisory councils in other jurisdictions and many have spoken of the need to have a young voice on the council. Depending on the age group one goes for, they might not possess those formal qualifications. Someone could be ex officio, it depends on how one looks for these individuals. How does Professor FitzGerald propose that we deal with ensuring a young voice or young voices are on the advisory council or in its work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Professor FitzGerald's opening statement made the point that the legislation should not be overly-prescriptive on the composition of the council or on additional functions for the council that could serve to distract from or dilute its core mandate. Is Professor FitzGerald aware of any sections in the Bill, as drafted, that would do that? Does he suggest that we remove anything or is it a warning against being overly prescriptive about the council?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Professor Buckley and Dr. Glynn have made some important points and we have had a good discussion. Professor Buckley touched on offshore wind farms and their appropriate location.I think Professor Buckley mentioned soil types as well. Is she saying onshore or offshore is a more appropriate place for wind farms or is she just highlighting where they are placed, irrespective of whether onshore or offshore? She also referenced the national biodiversity action plan. What are her thoughts on the role, when this Bill is passed, of the local authorities in actioning the national plan and in actions from this Bill? I have two questions for Dr. Glynn pertaining to his opening remarks and the recommendations he made. He highlighted Irish territorial waters in the definition of "sink". Will he elaborate on that point? He acknowledged the role of early dialogue and societal buy-in. I think that is crucial in anything we do. He said behavioural change and demand reduction will be required and the national objective is unlikely to be met by technological means alone. Will he expand on that point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My first question relates to NESC. We have had a large discussion about just transition. In his opening remarks, Dr. O'Connell made reference to a NESC report, Addressing Employment Vulnerability as Part of a Just Transition in Ireland. He went on to say that a request in the climate action plan asked NESC to identify steps that could be taken to address the vulnerability arising from the transition to low carbon and a more digital or automated future. Given that, is NESC willing or able to make a recommendation around just transition for this committee? Dr. O'Connell went on to refer to the interim report of the just transition commission and he might send to the committee a link to that report because it would be helpful. In terms of his engagement and his advisory role, would it be possible to consider making a recommendation on that to this committee? I heard what he said about his belief about referencing just transition in the Bill and that will be considered by the committee in a short while. It is wonderful to have Ms Finegan here and to hear from the climate action unit within the Department of the Taoiseach. My questions relate to climate action plans and the role of the climate action delivery board. I think there were 183 actions referenced in the climate plan. How are we progressing on those actions? That will give us an indication as to how we are going to proceed and achieve, going forward, with the new Bill. If and when the new Bill is passed, what role would Ms Finegan see for her unit? Would its role expand? All the various Government Departments need to be stitched together. I welcome Ms Finegan's remarks about the involvement of Comhairle na nÓg, particularly in relation to the jargon on the climate change section of gov.ie. I have suggested that Comhairle na nÓg might be considered for the Climate Change Advisory Council because we need to have a future's voice on climate change. There was a lot of food for thought in Professor Anderson's remarks, particularly around our commitments under the Paris Agreement. What oversight or monitoring system would he recommend, post the implementation and adoption of this Bill?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their time this morning and for their input. I have a question for Mr. Carroll and will focus on two elements. He referred to the just transition in his opening remarks and there were some questions around it. From his experience does he believe it is something that should be stated explicitly in legislation or should it be referred to and then fleshed out subsequently? He might give us his thoughts on that. He made a comment a few minutes ago about the review set for 2023. I believe that is the European Green Deal but he might elaborate on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is that NECP due for review here in Ireland in 2023?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for being delayed. I was at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, which I am sure Mr. O'Rourke is glad he was not at. That will be for another day. I congratulate Mr. O'Rourke on his appointment. It is lovely to have him here. I have read his opening statement. On the decarbonisation of the sector and the ESB's contribution to it, I commend Mr. O'Rourke. I heard a presentation from his public affairs section some weeks ago and it was very informative. What supports has the ESB given over the past year to both residential and business customers in the face of the pandemic? While that is slightly off topic, I would like an answer since Mr. O'Rourke is here. On the ESB's Brighter Future strategy, I am aware from Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, from which I hail, that the council has worked closely with the electricity suppliers to change sodium lights to LED lights. Is Mr. O'Rourke familiar with this? Will he enlighten the committee — excuse the pun — on how many public lanterns have been changed across the country? Mr. O'Rourke said 240,000 new meters are being installed across the country, resulting in efficiencies. He might delve into this a little. With regard to energy security overall, I would be interested in hearing Mr. O'Rourke's thoughts on Ireland's energy security in the face of Brexit and the impact it may have on energy efficiency in Ireland. I join Senator Higgins in commenting on No. 29 Fitzwilliam Street. I welcome Mr. O'Rourke's comments on righting the wrongs of the 1960s and the destruction of the terrace, but there should be scope within the redeveloped complex to house a museum.He said the ESB is working with Dublin City Council, which I welcome. There should be some museum after the works are completed. It is imperative. He also said his own children saw the museum. As a child, I went to see it. Anybody in an educational facility, particularly in the east, will have gone to see it. It was a wonderful asset and I do not want to see it lost to the city.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their time today. This is a topic I could speak about all day but I will not. I know the Chair will make sure that does not happen. As a representative of an urban area, I want to ask Dr. O'Mahony and Mr. Murphy about the Dublin bikes scheme, which was referenced in the opening remarks. It has been a great success and it has provided that shift. Unfortunately for the region of Dublin, there has not been a bike sharing scheme to cover the entire area. This presents limitations to the benefits one can enjoy from this type of scheme. Will the witnesses touch on the regionalisation of bike and car sharing schemes and the benefits that would accrue from them? My next question is for Mr. Cussen. I thank him for his opening statement and remarks. With regard to the guide to the planning process and the document he gave to us in advance of this meeting, I compliment his office on the information that has been given to the public about the planning process. The new leaflets are very beneficial and I compliment everyone involved. In saying this, recently we have witnessed a large volume of strategic housing developments, which I hope will come to an end quite shortly. Mr. Cussen spoke about sustainable planning. Does he have enough resources to deal with the large-scale developments, which, it has to be said, are mainly infill sites in urban areas? I am interested to hear his thoughts on this. Mr. Cussen also spoke about the role and responsibility of the regional assembly. Taking in context the role of the regional assembly, and of the councils with regard to the climate action plans that each local authority is working through, what is Mr. Cussen's view of how we could reform or strengthen their role in all of this? At times, local authorities, particularly in Dublin, have their own individual climate action plans and on top of all of this is a regional strategy. I know they are all meant to intermingle at various levels but I find it cumbersome. Mr. Cussen might touch on this. Mr. Cussen also mentioned the brownfield land register and that it is his intention to have it complete. By when will this be done?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I bid the witnesses a good afternoon and thank them for their time. If I could pick up on some of Dr. Caulfield's opening remarks, he referred to equity and just transition. I heard his responses to some of the questions on electric vehicles and also on car sharing. Where is the best balance between the two? The just transition is required but we want people to look at and explore alternative modes of transport, including the targets that we have set for electric vehicles? Where does he think the best spot is in terms of delivering on our targets?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Caulfield. If I may, I will ask a few questions on BusConnects and other issues. Ms Graham mentioned that there was a review of the transport strategy from 2016. When is that likely to be concluded? Will it be this year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Sticking with that, we have seen a major change in public transport and other modes of transport since the start of the pandemic, will that be taken into consideration in the context of BusConnects which has been extensively discussed this afternoon? Does that change the model in any way given that people are working from home and changing their patterns?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What was the original target for the reduction in emissions if BusConnects, as proposed, was delivered and how does that vary across the spectrum?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know the NTA is reviewing it at present, but what is the timeframe for the delivery of BusConnects now given the pandemic and have the costs changed for the overall scheme?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I wish to comment on something Mr Creegan said in terms of the routes going to An Bord Pleanála. Are they going collectively? I had thought there was consideration for a staged process. Are all 16 routes going together?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good luck with that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The discussion has been fascinating. I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions. Dr. Sloman spoke very passionately about what has happened in Wales. One of the elements we are talking about is the use of electric vehicles and how that can be facilitated, particularly in major towns and cities in terms of the infrastructure that is required, such as through the provision of charging points. I ask her to allude to how much work has been done and progress made on that to facilitate the transition to electric vehicles. I thank Professor McKinnon and Dr. Windisch for their contributions. Professor McKinnon mentioned freight and I want talk about regional aspects for the greater Dublin area, Leinster or whatever. How do policymakers look at challenges on a regional basis rather than just in the context of one local authority or municipal area? I ask because, to me, that is one of the challenges that we would face. For instance, car- or bike-sharing schemes are very popular but sometimes different areas want to do their own thing. They are not all matched up on a regional basis so I would like to hear their own thoughts on that issue. In terms of public transport, the issue of bus priority and carpool lanes has been touched on. What do the witnesses think of public service vehicle lanes? Do they think they have a place in our transition?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the contributors for their time and comments. They mentioned that onshore wind accounted for about 38% of our electricity last year. What percentage do our guests estimate offshore to account for, given the number of projects in the pipeline over the coming years? In my constituency, there is the Kish Bank basin proposal, which is a rehash of a previous plan that did not get very far, thankfully. I note what our guests said about wind turbines and all the technological advancements. There are now fewer turbines and the plan has changed somewhat. Nevertheless, after the public consultation, things have gone quiet and people are unsure as to what the next stage is. Mr. Moran spoke about communication. It is important that the public are aware of the next phase when the consultation is complete. Mr. Cunniffe stated "more than 10% of renewable generation was lost because the grid could not accommodate it." What measures could prevent that loss of energy? Does the technology exist? One issue I have come across relates to the energy cloud. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently launched a scheme with Clúid Housing. To me, it seems to be a really good and efficient use of potentially lost energy in the grid. Mr. Cunniffe stated that we will not decarbonise our electricity system without new overhead lines or underground cables. Is the preference of Wind Energy Ireland's members for overhead or underground? It is a controversial issue and I am interested in hearing our guests' views.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will be brief. I know we are limited in time. I thank Mr. Foley and his colleagues in EirGrid for the presentation. I understand an estimated €50 to €75 million worth of electricity goes to waste each year when wind turbines are powered down or energy is dumped because more has been produced than can be used. I raised this issue with the Wind Energy Ireland representatives earlier. The Minister, Darragh O'Brien, launched a new initiative with Clúid Housing, in partnership with EnergyCloud, which allows for excess energy to be used to heat hot water and homes and alleviate the risk of fuel poverty - about 460,000 households are at risk of fuel poverty across the country. About 50 houses in the Clúid scheme are using EnergyCloud. What are the thought of EirGrid on utilising that excess energy across the grid? Does it view it as a realistic option that could be rolled out with local authorities? I refer to point one of the summary. In terms of electricity security for the island, how does Mr. Foley envisage the threat to that? Are there any blackspots across the grid currently? He said the grid generally talked about "most". Where are the most prevalent blackspots, i.e. threats to electricity security across the island?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for the information they have provided today. Their statements have been very engaging. I will start with Dr. Lysaght. He provided statistics regarding impacts on biodiversity and the loss of biodiversity. I note that, in his opening statement, he included statistics regarding decreases in the numbers of fish and birds. If he has any further information in that regard, I ask him to forward it to the committee after today's meeting. I am sure it would be of great interest to members. I represent an urban area in south Dublin and I homed in on an issue Professor Stout raised. She mentioned street trees and other green spaces being encouraged in urban areas. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is one of the local authorities in the country that has a biodiversity officer, which it has had for quite some time now. That is probably one of the reasons it was one of the first councils to have a pollination plan. It is very important that we see more biodiversity officers at a local level. With regard to Professor Stout's vision of more trees and open spaces being retrofitted into the urban landscape, will she elaborate further as to how she sees this being done? Would it be through the development plan process, local area plans or some other method? How would it be achieved? Mr. Fogarty mentioned the climate and biodiversity crisis and highlighted the issue of untreated sewage in our rivers, lakes and streams. I have previously raised issues regarding the misconnections that frequently occur. Is Mr. Fogarty of the view that the waste polluting our waters primarily derives from agriculture or is part of it residential, industrial or commercial? I am not saying that it is only a matter of misconnections. Some of this issue is the result of run-off from land use. Does Mr. Fogarty know the percentage that arises from misconnections or does he have any detail as to the number of these misconnections that are impacting on our biodiversity? With regard to the biodiversity Act Mr. Fogarty mentioned, if such an Act were to be introduced, who would he see policing it and how?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Lysaght.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. The question was directed to Professor Stout.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	As Deputy Bríd Smith stated, it is very hard to ask any new questions but I will do my best in the limited time available. I thank the speakers for their contributions. It illustrates the level of interest in this matter that we are only now getting to the final questions. In her opening remarks, Dr. Tienhaara she spoke about fossil fuel phase-out policies and the issue that governments may have in overcompensating sectors in an adversarial legal process. Is any other method possible? In the previous contribution she spoke about phasing out treaties but how else could this be done? There have been exciting prospects for green hydrogen, and I stress the green element after we heard the previous contribution. I note Dr. Carton leads the HyLIGHT advisory group so what does he see as the biggest challenges and obstacles facing the expanding roll-out of hydrogen here? Many of the questions I wanted to put to Dr. Bresnihan have already been asked. However, he stated that the 70 data centres in Ireland use approximately 11% of grid capacity at present. EirGrid estimates this will move to 28% by 2030. I read Dr. Bresnihan's remarks in The Irish Times that it may be up to 70%. That is quite a considerable differential. Will the witness elaborate on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Tienhaara. Does Dr. Carton wish to comment?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the guests and to those who are returning. My question is for the CRU and its opening statement on energy security, which I have raised previously with the Department and in the Dáil. The CRU said that delivering the regulatory framework to support the new interconnectors Greenlink and the Celtic link. What does it foresee as the stumbling blocks, if any, in that process? Could the witnesses outline them from the CRU perspective? On LNG, reference was made to the review of energy security by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. Will the CRU elaborate a little more on that from this standpoint? On data centres, the CRU has said there was a consultation on a draft direction on the new data centre connection policy. I may be wrong, but I thought this was published in July. How many people engaged, took part or were consulted in that consultation? I found the comments by the EirGrid witnesses to be positive and welcoming considering the debate in the public domain on energy security and supply over the next couple of months in particular. EirGrid highlighted that Ireland had achieved 43% of all electricity in 2020 from renewable sources, which was ahead of the target. I commend EirGrid and others on securing that, which is very welcome. Mr Foley said the market must evolve if we are to achieve our collective decarbonisation goals and he highlighted the right technologies, on time and at a fair price. We are all trying to achieve that and we want to see it come on stream. He outlined the outlook for the winter, which I touched on, and he was quite positive about that, which is reassuring, particularly people watching in. He referred to EirGrid's generation capacity statement and the need for a robust plan under direction from the regulator and the Department to deal with the issues in the short to medium term, notwithstanding the unpalatable nature of some of those contingency measures. In the time we have left, he might outline those contingency measures. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On that point, is that the consultation that closed in early July or am I thinking of the consultation on data centres?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms MacEvilly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Foley.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Carberry and his colleagues for the information they supplied. First on the circular economy and the Bill, to me this is a missing piece of the puzzle. We are talking about reducing our emissions but we obviously must encourage and incentivise the public to do what they can and many people are doing what they can without any need for legislation. This committee has spoken about packaging in particular and the need to do what we can to reduce packaging and recycle it appropriately etc. Deputy Cronin was talking about social enterprise and how we can encourage that. There was an upcycling website, its name escapes me, which had information on how to reuse and share discarded items. I think it had problems with funding about a year and a half ago. I hope that the levies that are to be collected will help towards funding these initiatives. Mr. Carberry spoke about that earlier. On the heads of the Bill, Mr. Carberry's opening statement mentioned the national food waste prevention roadmap. We need to reduce our food waste by 50% by 2030. How will the Bill incentivise the proper disposal of food waste, while also discouraging the discarding of food waste? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Will that roadmap go out to public consultation once the various agencies and organisations have looked at it? Is that the idea?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I think that would be a good thing. Staying on food waste, I hear what Mr. O'Donoghue is saying about commercial waste and his point on the three-bin system is fair. Within Dublin, waste management was trying to look at the by-laws about people disposing in the wrong bin in the domestic waste sphere. There was talk of fines, levies and everything else. No enough information campaigns are being conducted on the green, brown and grey or black, or sometimes purple, bins. There needs to be education around both commercial and domestic waste disposal and people need the benefits of segregating waste explained. Hopefully that will be done. I will leave that with the officials. Mr. Carberry mentioned the Minister having the power to introduce new environmental levies. Head 6 makes a proposal around regulations, which Mr. Carberry said was quite a small list. Section 3 goes on to say the amount of the levy will be specified in the regulation but should be no more than €1 per item. Will Mr. Carberry elaborate on section 4 and whether it refers to an individual producer having to pay the levy but if it is sold by a multiple, then it will be collected by them?Section 3 of head 6 concerns the €1 cap on the levy and was included to indicate the absolute theoretical maximum. We expect the levies that will be set by the regulator will be much lower, and further detail will be set out on how and when the rate of the levies can be increased. Head 4 concerns businesses selling or supplying leviable items and sets out that the person who carries out that business is responsible for the collection and payment of the levy. There may be multiple businesses carried out in the same outlet, such as a department store that has a concession area within it. An example of this would be a department store that has one till for its main business, with a concession area that has its own separate till and supplies. The person running the concession area is equally responsible for the collection of the levy for his or her business.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This would be similar to the plastic bag levy.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will conclude and come back in later as I am sure other colleagues would like to contribute. Under head 6, I note it states that section 72 of the Waste Management Act will be repealed. Is the reason for that because there will be an amalgamation of the various waste Acts?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	From our perspective, the broad parameter of the legislation is one matter while the regulations may be of more interest to us, although that is for a different day's work. I will come back in after colleagues have contributed.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On head 8, the witnesses spoke of fixed penalty notices. What is envisaged there? Would the local authorities maintain those records, issue the notices and pursue them? On head 10, Mr. Carberry spoke earlier about data protection issues, which I have been aware of since September of last year. Hopefully this legislation will address those concerns. Is it envisaged that the local authorities will be the data controllers? If that is the case, I would go back to the issues of the lack of litter wardens and resources that local authorities do not have. I am thinking about their ability to maintain and issue fixed penalty notices and monitor CCTV footage, as well as the number of litter wardens available in each local authority's administrative area. Maybe the circular economy fund could assist in that regard. My final question is on head 11. Could Mr. Carberry outline what the rationale behind that particular section? In terms of investigating, detecting and prosecuting the offences, I assume that the local authority will be responsible. Mr. Carberry might elaborate, however.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before we move on, from what the Cathaoirleach said earlier and on the basis of my experience in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, we do not have enough litter wardens. If we took a vox pop of the committee, we could all speak to our local authorities and say there are not enough litter wardens, particularly in rural local authorities which have vast areas. Senator Pauline O'Reilly referred to the laneway that is regularly dumped in. Nobody can see it but the local authority is charged with cleaning it up. It is all well and good having legislation which states that it is the responsibility of the local authority to issue the penalty notice and to do all that, but if, under the legislation, we are not looking to fund it through collecting levies, that is missing a key part of this. We have to be realistic. There is no point in having the legislation if we cannot enforce it. Enforcement is a requirement, unfortunately, in certain local authority areas because of the volume of waste that must be dealt with on a regular basis.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I accept that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Hurley. We certainly need to give serious thought to this. I accept what Mr. Hurley says about the fixed-penalty notices. That assumes that the individual can be identified. One of the biggest issues, aside from whether it goes to court or not, is whether you can identify the culprit who is dumping a vast amount of stuff. I would say that, between the fixed-penalty notices and the circular fund, we need to examine how we could fund many of these positions that the local authorities will need. Finally, someone might elaborate on head 11. They might confirm that we are sticking with the fixed-penalty notices and CCTV under this head.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. That is fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I see. Okay. I thank Mr. Hurley for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their insights into this issue. I get the sense from my colleagues on the committee that we could spend all day talking about it. The whole topic is fascinating because of the breadth of issues it covers. I note both witnesses stated they watched the committee's discussion last week. From my perspective, and as Senator Higgins just said, this is about manufacturing. We want to reduce the volume of unnecessary waste at whatever stage of its life it is discarded and, hopefully, reuse it in many different ways. If that is not the case, we need to ensure that the manufacturing industry is thinking about the longevity of the product it is manufacturing and, ultimately, how it can be reused, recycled or repurposed. I would like to hear both witnesses' thoughts on how, in the circular economy, we can tackle that aspect in the proposed legislation, bearing in mind that, realistically, much of the stuff we are talking about is probably imported. While it may be a moot point for some manufacturers, those that are located here would have to abide by that. I agree with the witnesses' comments about strengthening the wording. I believe Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about this last week and I totally agree. We owe it to the next generation and the generations that come after it to ensure this is strengthened. Ms O'Brien made the point that legislation must be for down the road; it is not for the here and now. This committee, of all the committees in the Oireachtas, is of that view. Ms O'Brien also mentioned setting a percentage target for achieving this. I would be interested to hear, for instance, about manufacturing and reusing or repurposing products. Ms O'Brien said initially that she did not want a paltry target of 2%. I ask both witnesses to talk us through the various elements and what kinds of targets they believe we need to aim for to make meaningful change. The other aspect I would like to touch on is contamination. By and large, the majority of people, regardless of their family make-up or product consumption, are eager to play their part. Unfortunately, contamination is not necessarily an act they are carrying out on purpose. Some of this is the result of misinformation. We are all aware of what kinds of plastics can be recycled. Contamination happens across the board, be it in what we would call our general waste bin or our compostable and recycling bins. That must be tackled, so we will have to be strong on education and fund it in the legislation. On the issue of contamination, Ms O'Brien spoke correctly about the lack of compostability of some products that are labelled as such. That is a broad issue to discuss but she is right. The Houses of the Oireachtas should be leaders in that. I hope that VOICE Ireland will continue its engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas to try to tackle that issue. I will address a few other points made by Ms O'Brien. I note she is from Michigan. I am not sure which part but I must commend her on that. That is good news and I would like to hear more about it. She mentioned people who retain products. She is speaking to somebody who has a cupboard full of plastic containers that are kept for lunch boxes and God knows what else. Friends slag me over the number of Calpol medicine spoons I keep. I do not know how sick I going to be but I retain these things for a long time. What that points out, however, is the volume of excess products that we collect, which could either go for recycling or be repurposed at home. Ms O'Brien mentioned that "producers must take responsibility for designing out waste in products and packaging." I mentioned the medicine spoons purely as an example for people who may be viewing this debate. We do not have an option to buy the product in question without a plastic spoon. That is where we need to get to with this legislation. Ms O'Brien also mentioned her friend with bananas in a bag. I wonder if she is still a friend after Ms O'Brien accosted her in the shop. As Ms O'Brien said, however, her friend made a comment about the cost and said it was cheaper to go for that option. As with our discussions on previous legislation about just transition, we must look at the cost of this. Single individuals and the elderly try to buy as few products as possible to ensure the products stay fresh but sometimes that is simply not an option. We need to look at that. Senator Higgins's made a point about the waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, return scheme, which has been a resounding success. If we were to model our circular economy on that system, I believe it would work very well. Mr. Schweitzer said he watched our discussion last week and I commend him on doing so. Will he elaborate a little on extended producer responsibility? Touching on what I was saying earlier about manufacturing, I believe that is something we need to examine further. I might come back in later on the deposit return scheme.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	He just does not want to be asked again. That is all he is doing.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Thank you.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I want to come back in on the DRS. The waste strategy has changed over the last three years but when we explored it in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council three or four years ago we found that there was not an appetite for it among the Dublin waste management authorities. They were not too enamoured with the idea of a DRS. Things have thankfully changed and our level of recycling in Ireland is quite high relative to our European counterparts. I want to ask Mr. Schweitzer and Ms O'Brien their views on how a DRS increases participation in recycling. Is it an absolutely necessary element of the circular economy or would people comply without it?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It goes back to labelling again.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have family members from Midland.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Schweitzer might send in a note on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for my late arrival. I was next door at another committee meeting.I will not go into other matters because I do not want to go over ground I presume my colleagues have covered. However, I wish to ask about the connection between ETBs and the need to train technicians in order that we can facilitate people who, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, want to reuse more and extend the lifelines of products. There is a willingness across the country to do that. If we could supply technicians to help with that, it would be important. Dr. Brennan referred to the WEEE scheme and the White Goods Association working together on how best to efficiently recycle goods, where necessary, and support those who want to extend the lifetime of products. We had a great discussion last week about innovative ways to support communities which do that. My local repair shop is, I think, busier now because people are thinking like that and looking at the volume of items disposed of unnecessarily. The next generation may believe that the previous one was crazy to think of everything as being disposable. Maybe that was a marketing ploy over the past decade or so. Hopefully, this legislation will encourage industry and, more importantly, the public to think and act differently. Dr. Brennan said it is about encouragement if nothing else. The legislation is necessary but it is also about a bit of carrot and less stick. I thank Dr. Brennan and offer my apologies for not being here from the start.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I add my appreciation for the witnesses' statements, comments and answers this afternoon. I begin with Dr. Dunford and Dr. Moran, and the Burren Project specifically. The Burren is some distance from my constituency of Dún Laoghaire but, nonetheless, it is a place I have loved visiting in the past. I am reading from the evaluation of the Burren programme. One of the comments that stood out in Dr. Dunford's opening statement was on bureaucracy, the need for the flexible administration of a similar system which needs to be responsive to farmers' needs as opposed to farmers having to respond to the criteria or systems that are put in place. I hear Dr. Dunford on that. Giving that flexibility would probably be difficult for us as legislators but I can certainly understand the need for it. The statement notes that as "a flagship agri-environment scheme, the Burren Programme also maintains strong links with environmental organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGO) in Ireland and Europe." The REPS was introduced a number of years ago. In that context, how do the witnesses envisage a programme similar to the Burren programme being rolled out on a more national scale? Will they elaborate on the need for flexibility? I do not have any questions for Mr. Traas but I thank him very much for his responses. I hear Mr. Sheehan, especially in relation to dairy farmers, the pressure they are under and the perception that has been created. I heard news coverage on COP26 this morning which referred to the pressure on farmers. In a way, it is pigeonholing agriculture as a whole sector. That puts off people who I believe genuinely want to work with the land. It is in their interests to work with the land and ensure it is viable for future generations. There is an eagerness to improve processes. Mr. Sheehan's opening statement was honest and frank and one I felt needed to be heard. I hope we see similar projects to his own BRIDE Project evolve right across the country. My questions were focused on the Burren programme and I ask the witnesses to respond on that. Maybe Mr. Sheehan will have a comment or two of his own. I thank all the witnesses for their time this afternoon.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those are very positive remarks as we approach the end of the meeting.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am conscious of the Minister's time. I apologise; I had problems with the broadband here in the office, but I am on the campus. I ask the Minister about his comments about microgeneration and selling back to the grid. When does he hope that individual properties will be able to avail of that type of scheme? The Minister touched on energy security earlier. I ask him to elaborate further on the two interconnectors which are due on stream by 2027 if I am not mistaken.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was on the interconnectors.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My apologies to the witnesses. Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I was also in the Chamber, so I missed the first section and the opening statements. I have some questions. I apologise if they repeat my colleagues' questions. This question is probably specifically for the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. Regarding the electronic vehicles and the supply chain, what level of supply is there for second-hand or used electric vehicles? Is there a good supply chain into Ireland given Brexit and all the challenges it has posed to the economy and to the country? My second question is about the need for more electric charging points, whether at garages or on street. The witnesses mentioned that some local authorities are better than others. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is good and proactive. Maybe this is more a question for ESB. I am thinking about public lighting doubling as a charging point. I am sure there is an additional cost to such infrastructure but it is about being imaginative in our public spaces to transform the available charging points automatically and quite easily. One of people's biggest causes for hesitation when buying electric vehicles is whether charging points will be available on their journey. Documentaries often show charging points in garages being in use when people pull up, which delays their journey. It is all about efficiency. The witnesses might address what can be improved about the infrastructure for charging points, both from a local authority and an industry point of view. My third question is on car and bike-sharing schemes. One regression in Dublin was when four local authorities all had individual tenders for a shared bike scheme. There is no uniformity for car-sharing schemes either. There might be one car-sharing scheme in one local authority in the greater Dublin area compared with another local authority. It is not so bad for cars but it is problematic for bike-sharing schemes. I thought it would have been better to have an all-of-Dublin contract, like the bike scheme to which Dr. Ó Tuama and others referred, across all the Dublin local authorities to ensure there was uniformity and ease of use to encourage people to use them for whatever reason, whether it is because they do not have storage for bikes or it is more convenient for them. Those are my questions. If there is any need for clarity, people might come back to me.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there hesitation from customers to buy second-hand electric vehicles? What is the life expectancy of the battery given it is probably one of the most expensive parts of the car?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for all their work to date. As a precursor to their work, we had to navigate the Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny so we feel their pain over recent months. The fact they had met more than 15 times by September, despite the pandemic, is to be commended, because I am sure it is not easy with everybody coming from across the country. I apologise for not coming in earlier, I had another meeting. Professor Ó Gallachóir mentioned the issue of transition and monitoring the pace of change in various sectors and Departments. I apologise if this has already been asked, but will he outline how that will be monitored for the purposes of the annual review? He mentioned in his opening statement the offsetting of targets within sectors and how that might be done. I think he mentioned negative targeting. Will he elaborate on that? With regard to just transition, will Ms King speak on how the monitoring of potential displacement within sectors will be done and how it might impact on workers?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Moore and Ms Garvey for their attendance today and for their opening statement. I will touch on the opening statement and the National Economic and Social Council's obligations under the climate action plan. Ms Garvey mentioned NESC's role in that plan and that it has been requested to continue to provide strategic advice, research and analytical support for a just transition. It is on that basis that my first question is formed. It is to elaborate on the research and analytical support NESC has already conducted over the past year or so. The witnesses might elaborate a little bit on that for the committee to outline what they have uncovered and what their advice is with regard to just transition. I note their definition of a just transition is "one which seeks to ensure transition is fair, equitable and inclusive in terms of processes and outcomes". The difficulty, however, is what we have all heard to date about that just transition and, indeed, the supports that are in place for people who might need them. My second question is about one of the key elements the witnesses pointed out in their opening statement. I refer to the second key point about the need to "adopt a proactive, managed and participatory approach to transition at national, regional and local levels". On that, obviously, there is agriculture and we accept and are aware of that. Have the witnesses delved into research on a sectoral basis and, say, gender and age cohorts? If so, they might share that with the committee. I can see that just transition impacts on all different strands, spheres, individuals and communities, and while agriculture is the obvious one in the room today, we all know there will need to be transitions of many different sectors of different types. The witnesses might elaborate on that, please. Again, I thank them very much for all their work and for their participation today.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their contributions thus far. In response to Dr. Healy's last point, we have been discussing climate change, carbon budgets, just transition and many other issues today and over the last few days at this committee. Today's session in particular, given the breadth of the organisations and sectors that are represented, is akin to the social partnership process of the past. The Government must ensure that partnership engagement happens across all sectors because this will require the input of all sectors across society.Given the number of organisations and sectors involved in today's meeting and the time, I will keep my questions brief. I acknowledge the positivity and constructive engagement from Chambers Ireland and the IFA in particular, because of the discussion around farming far in advance of carbon budgets being set, as well as ICTU and other union organisations in the way they have approached this. As people have said, it is easy to say "No" to any change but there is a recognition in society that we need to change and there is a willingness to change across the organisations I have mentioned and many others in various sectors. Whether they are willing to change to the extent required by the carbon budgets that will be set in those respective sectors remains to be seen. Going back to Dr. Healy's point, the key element will be that dialogue among all the sectors in order that we can have a very rich discussion about how it can be done. I would like to know what all the organisations consider to be the top three challenges in achieving the targets in their respective areas. I also ask them to say a few words about just transition and how they see it being rolled out for their specific sector or organisation. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would like to ask about that last point on energy and farmers' input to that. The IFA might send the committee a note on how farmers feel they are not engaged in that process. That would be beneficial. I thank all the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their engagement thus far. My questions would come under some main headings relating to the witnesses' contributions, namely: Mr. Ó Raghallaigh's consideration of the resources to deliver, which I will touch upon shortly; Mr. Mahon's contribution on the local authority's role in all of that; and Mr. Carroll's points about retrofitting. My first question is for Mr. Ó Raghallaigh. On the overall targets that need to be achieved across Departments, what kinds of physical and human resources would be required? What changes are being made currently across Departments to ensure that those are targets are met? In the context of the 31 local authorities, Mr. Mahon spoke of fostering and achieving those targets and engaging with various stakeholders. Colleagues on the committee have mentioned the public participation networks and other local organisations with which to engage. I did not hear much about youth in this context. Young people have really driven this agenda. One of the reasons we are all talking about climate targets in different sectors is, arguably, because young people have for many years been ahead of the curve on this and have demanded change. This is commendable, but the local authorities are at the coalface of responding to this challenge and I am not hearing a lot about that engagement. Yes, there are those plans that must be reviewed every five years, but I wonder how the local authorities will engage with young people and those organisations such as Comhairle na nÓg, and others we have spoken about before. From what I heard, there has been very little reference to the engagement with, and the onus on, the regional authorities. There are some challenges, which we have spoken about before, such as car sharing, bike sharing, scooter schemes and other types of schemes where local authorities will need to act together. The regional authorities play a pivotal role in that regard. Perhaps Mr. Mahon will comment on this matter. On retrofitting, Mr. Carroll mentioned a target of 36,000 by 2030. With regard to his plans for local authority housing, he mentioned a 40% target in connection with local authority dwellings not performing to the level required for a B2 rating. Has the review started? How advanced is it in determining how many dwellings do not hit the target or will require retrofitting? If it has not started, when will it be completed? Mr. Mahon mentioned in his opening statement the retrofitting of the national public lighting stock and the local authority fleet. What are the percentages for each? What is the percentage for the success regarding national public lighting? How many vehicles do the local authorities have that are of renewable stock?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In a nutshell, are we talking about additional staff or redeploying staff to the climate action units?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Mahon. Perhaps he will send us a note on the public lighting. It would be nice for the committee to have a baseline of how many lights are converted and how many are to be.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Lemass for that. If I can, Chair, very briefly address a point to Mr. Carroll about the private stock, there is a huge demand for that, particularly under the better energy warmer homes scheme. We all need to do our best to achieve the target. There is a willingness from the public. We just need to ensure the resources are in place.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Coyle is very welcome. I am sorry I was delayed for the opening remarks. I note Mr. Coyle mentioned the Maritime Area Planning Act in his opening statement. I am from a coastal community in Dún Laoghaire-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----and obviously there is a lot of opportunity on the east coast. The east coast is the priority area for offshore wind. Given the events in Ukraine and the need for our energy independence, how does Mr. Coyle foresee the development application and subsequent permission for wind farms on the east coast? I apologise if Mr. Coyle has gone over this ground already, but I am interested to hear his thoughts on it. Our need for our own wind energy and how to utilise that have come into sharp focus now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Coyle mentioned the floating apparatus in Scotland and Wales. That has been mooted here. The technology has evolved over the last couple of years and, as Mr. Coyle correctly pointed out, the large-scale investment in this industry is coming on stream and improving all the time. Mr. Coyle also mentioned the shallowness of Dublin Bay and, I presume, the attractiveness of that section of the east coast.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The floating wind farms are slightly different in the sense that the visual amenity is always going to be an issue. We saw it in Arklow and anywhere that offshore energy has been mooted. For the Dublin area, the proximity to the coastline is the biggest issue. If it is too close to the shore, people will object.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It has to be towards the horizon.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our guests. I represent Dún Laoghaire, and I am sure they are very happy for Shannon Foynes Port to be a tier 1 port as opposed to a tier 2 one, given we went through that process previously.I also congratulate the Shannon Foynes Port Company on the funding it has drawn down from the Connecting Europe Facility. Mr. Keating mentioned channel depths of up to 32 m and specifically referenced consistently floating offshore. Is any consideration being given to fixed wind farms? Is there a reason, such as cost or an infrastructural basis, for only floating being explored? In 2013, Shannon Foynes was exploring wave energy, which has not been mentioned yet. Mr. Keating might elaborate on that. He mentioned that the Shannon Foynes Port Company had commissioned a report and €12 billion in supply chain investment was earmarked. A copy of that report might be useful for committee members following on from today's engagement. My third question relates to the other infrastructural projects mentioned in the opening remarks, which is the need for the completion of the Limerick to Foynes Adare bypass road scheme and the Foynes to Limerick railway line. Those two projects in particular are big asks and are running separately to what the port company will ultimately need. How are they progressing? Fibre-optic was also mentioned. Connectivity is obviously very important for the cluster to develop. Education was mentioned. Mr. Keating might give us an update on that. The identification of offshore grid connectivity points is crucial if we are to have floating or other types of wind farms in the estuary. What potential exists for connection to onshore grids?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I also mentioned fibre-optic connectivity and grid connectivity. Will Mr. Hallissey or Mr. Keating reply regarding those items?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses very much for that discussion and for their opening remarks. It has been a really useful discussion for us and certainly extremely interesting. I have three questions, one of which is about energy security and relates to EirGrid specifically. It is good to have its representatives back before the committee. This is something we discussed during their previous time at this committee. Specifically, EirGrid mentioned there is a temporary emergency generation plan for the next three winters, which is extremely welcome considering where we were last October. There was concern about that winter. EirGrid stated then in the opening remarks, however, that this would be operated by relevant market participants outside of the electricity market and only run as required for system stability and system security purposes. The witnesses might elaborate on that to give the committee a sense of what is proposed for the next three winters. Many witnesses referred to gas as a transitional fuel only. Do witnesses foresee gas being used post 2030 in our energy mix for energy security on the island? In terms of the up-front costs and outlay, many of the technologies we discussed today are somewhere in their infancy and others are expanding their capabilities. Will this ultimately mean a reduction in cost for the consumer? I know it is a bit early to say but given the plans that are before us, if it all pans out the way it should, could consumers ultimately see a reduction in the bills?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On a needs basis.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Senator Pauline O'Reilly. I want to pick up on the heat pumps. Mr. Hoyne mentioned a fair point. When we are talking about retrofitting, one-stop shops and all of the various workers who are needed to facilitate the volume of retrofitting, a fair point was made that some of the contractors are trained by the manufacturers of many of those products, independently of a national training programme. This is something we should consider when we talk about the retrofitting scheme. Reference was made to the apprenticeships and the need for those. It is incumbent on all of us in the Oireachtas to ensure that we encourage more apprenticeships. This has not been done for quite some time. I was at an event yesterday where this was being done. We need to see more of that to encourage people to take up apprenticeships. On the one-stop shops specifically, from our perspective and given the popularity of the retrofitting scheme, it has been oversubscribed. There is an inability to respond to the volume of queries. Mr. Hoyne mentioned the assessors. I already have had contact from people who are unhappy with assessors' reports and want a mechanism by which to feed back in to try to liaise or negotiate certain elements. Specifically, these are issues around older buildings and how to retrofit those. Some of those buildings present certain challenges, as I am sure Mr. Hoyne would appreciate. How does Mr. Hoyne believe we can get around that? Straightforward projects may, for example, be the semi-detached home that was built in the 1950s and the 1960s. When one goes back further than that, and the other witnesses were talking about the 1930s and 1940s buildings, it presents a challenge. The low-hanging fruit is straightforward but I would welcome Mr. Hoyne's views on the more complex buildings. In his contribution Mr. Hoyne pointed to the pipeline and the guarantee of work. There is a guarantee here for companies that specialise in the area of retrofitting, given the investment. Also in his opening statement, Mr. Hoyne referred to a digital academy for the sustainable built environment and how it was validating programmes on residential energy, retrofitting, management, and energy renovation of traditional buildings. Perhaps Mr. Hoyne will elaborate a little bit on that for us. I realise that the time remaining to me is zero, and I ask the Chairman for one second please. We could speak about this all day. The inputs and suggestions from Dr. Daly and Dr. Engel Purcell around this are very interesting, including the research project mentioned in their opening statement, which was the Climate Heritage Network, HiCLIP, study of nine different countries and 17 thematic activities. Perhaps the witnesses might elaborate on that for us please. If they could send a note on to the committee, that would be of interest to us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome our guests. It has been a good engagement thus far. There have certainly been many good answers coming back from the officials. I begin with the various schemes outlined in the opening statement. It is useful to hear how certain schemes are progressing. I caution against the use of acronyms because while I am aware that there are many schemes, we are trying to take people with us here and there is a lot of similarity between those acronyms. People could get lost. For the benefit of the committee, will our guests outline the difference between the community energy grant, the sustainable energy communities grant, the renewable electricity support scheme, the community benefit fund and the microgeneration scheme? I ask because some of them, as I heard in the opening statement, are ones people can apply for. Local communities were mentioned earlier in a response to one of the other members. Some of the organisations and groups have already come together. They are very familiar with making these applications and that is true. I am more conscious of the ones that are new to the whole idea. Dr. Byrne also mentioned the community energy officers in his opening statement. Are they going to be there to assist with all these schemes or is it specifically around microgeneration? Are they there to assist the local authorities in delivering on the authorities' own plans? That is my first question. Mr. Somers spoke about the renewable electricity support scheme. He highlighted there were parameters. I think he used the word "handcuffed" about European legislation on-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	-----state aid rules. How do we fare against our European counterparts on this? What we are talking about here is not innovative, per se. Many EU jurisdictions are way ahead of us and we are trying to play catch-up on that. I do not want to waste time - and we do not have it to waste - to try to catch up to where some of our counterparts are at. Turning to the Department, Mr. Deegan referenced the national retrofit plan in his opening remarks, thankfully. I heard what the Chairman said but I am going to ignore that and ask three points on it. One is the one-stop shop. We have spoken about that before but by my reckoning things have not improved on that. There is a great willingness to participate from the public. Mr. Deegan might provide an update. People who were previously approved for schemes were mentioned earlier, I think by Deputy Bríd Smith. That could have been the new 80% scheme announced earlier this year or indeed a previous scheme many years ago. Where do those people stand in regard to applying for the new 80% scheme? Let us say they made an application last year. The terms have improved, so can they avail of that improved scheme? The final point concerns the people who have actually had the assessments done. I think Deputy Bruton spoke about them earlier. We might refer to this cohort as the low-hanging fruit. These are simple, semi-detached houses, or maybe end-of-terrace ones. They are the ones that are easy and straightforward. However, what of more complex properties? What method is there for those property owners to engage to try to alleviate the concerns raised in the report?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I know.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. How long does Ms Buggie reckon it will be before a definitive model is found?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to know.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, primarily.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Older houses specifically.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Ms Simson and thank for her remarks, particularly as regards the REPower EU plan. Obviously, the emphasis of the plan has changed, given the geopolitical events Europe is facing. I am particularly struck by the need to protect and support Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic states. I had the opportunity to visit Lithuania recently. I saw what it did long before the Russian aggression in Ukraine began. It kind of had a prelude to the use of energy as a weapon. We have now come to see that right across Europe. Ireland is facing a skills shortage, as is the whole of Europe. Ms Simson mentioned that issue, which I welcome. Although it is not specifically under her remit, it has a direct impact on that remit. I ask her to address how Europe will provide, support and attract those necessary skills. We can do nothing without them. All the great plans cannot be dealt with if we do not have those skills. Ms Simson touched on solar. She is welcome to Dublin. I assure her that the sun shines here the odd time and we will be able to use solar power. Europe as a larger entity has great plans in that regard. I ask Ms Simson to expand on that issue in the context of the EU solar strategy specifically. As Ms Simson rightly pointed out, the committee and the State have been working in recent years to improve our credentials in terms of better energy security for the island and, ultimately, as the Chair stated, seeking to export in order to help support colleagues across the EU. I again thank Ms Simson. It is great to have her here with us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Like Senator Higgins, I will stand as otherwise our guests will not see me. I missed some of the contributions until the speakers stood up. I thank the Chairman, Deputy Leddin, for all of his work in organising today's meeting. In particular, I thank the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, a colleague of mine whose brainchild it was to open up the Seanad and ensure we heard at first hand from young people across the country. I thank all our guests for their contributions. I know some of our invited guests could not be here because the date of the meeting changed. I hope they will be able to participate when we engage with other groups in the next while, just as our guests have this morning.I am struck in this engagement by the passion demonstrated by the witnesses for the topic we are discussing today and how competent and confident they are. Mr. Galvin is the only Dub here and it did not faze him at all to go first. He was controversial, if I may say it, in raising the question of nuclear energy but it is a discussion we must have. It will happen in this Chamber and the Dáil Chamber. It will happen around Ireland. The debate on energy security has moved on now, given the events of the past couple of months, and particularly those starting 100 days ago in Ukraine. We must look at all options for energy. It was not just the question of energy that people have raised. They spoke about packaging, for example. Mr. Mustafa spoke about packaging and there is no choice for many of the products we purchase in shops. It is something that we as a committee have discussed with the circular economy legislation. We must try to take measures, both domestically and in Europe, and I was pleased to see so many MEPs sitting in the Gallery to listen to the contributions. If I were 16 and was invited to the Chamber, it would have been a great privilege for me. This demonstrates the engagement that is at the disposal of young people, whether it is through Comhairle na nÓg or Foróige. Today is a unique day and the witnesses rose to the challenge without any hesitation. Each and every one is very passionate about this topic and the witnesses spur us on because they engage with us. Let this not be the only engagement, and I know it will not be for many of the witnesses. We look for ideas and suggestions, including when new legislation is coming or there is public consultation for various initiatives being run by the Government. I ask each and every one of the witnesses to try to engage with the process. No matter how small, large or costly the ideas may be, we must hear them. Today should not be their last day to have their voices heard. Despite what Deputy Farrell has said, many of them may sit in this beautiful Chamber or the Chamber down the hall, elected in their own right. I hope they are and that many of them consider a life of public representation. It is really necessary that we hear their thoughts and ideas and that they get to implement them in times to come. I can feel the stares so I am sure I am over my two-minute allocation at this point. I mentioned energy and I was also struck by the biodiversity question posed to us. It is something the committee has engaged with quite a bit. My colleagues, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan and Senator Timmy Dooley, would have liked to have been here today but could not be. With regard to public transport, Mr. Thomson mentioned how he got here and I am very impressed by it and the fact that he managed to get here, given all the challenges we have heard about in Dublin Airport over the past couple of days. He raises a very good point about rural transport and options that he does not have. Somewhere like my constituency in Dún Laoghaire, on the other hand, has plenty of public transport, although that does not mean everybody uses it. It is yet another challenge we must face. I will end with a question for Foróige, whose members mentioned its Ecollective. I wonder how often it meets as a group. The members mentioned its main role involving climate justice, for which I commend them. How do they engage with individuals that they perceive to be at the fore of climate action? Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has a very active Comhairle na nÓg and I engage with it from time to time. I ask each and every one of the groups to engage with local representatives because today is unique and historic. Well done to each and every one of the contributors but let it not be the last occasion.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Lynn for her presentation and for outlining some of those elements. The key thing for me is the 60 new staff she mentioned and the additional funding of €55 million, which will have enormous benefits for the NPWS. I know there will be an internal review to improve the service that is there. I want to compliment Dr. Lynn and her colleagues within the NPWS for the work they do on a daily basis. Its remit is quite broad, as Dr. Lynn outlined in her opening statement, but I want to touch on a few matters. One of the issues that have been mentioned was the MPAs and the special protection areas, SPAs. That was interesting to me because I represent Dún Laoghaire, a coastal constituency, and one where we are familiar with the SPAs. There has to be a balance between the SPAs and other uses of land adjacent to the SPAs. We need to find that balance in order to try to make progress on various schemes. I was glad to hear Dr. Lynn's emphasis on biodiversity. The pollination corridors are a key function for some of the Tidy Towns groups. I know that some officials in the local authorities, such as Anne Murray, the biodiversity officer in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, are keen on promoting them but we can never get enough of them. I hear what Dr. Lynn is saying about open spaces and Deputy Alan Farrell referred to that as well. They cannot all be manicured to within an inch of their lives either. We have to let nature grow and we have to protect bees and other wildlife, such as birds, which Dr. Lynn referenced. How does Dr. Lynn envisage that we can expand pollinating corridors and other such initiatives to ensure that is a crucial element in the next national biodiversity action plan? We need to see progress being made, not just in rural areas but in urban areas as well. In Dublin in particular we need to see greater progress on that. I also agree with Dr. Lynn that there is great buy-in from the public on this. They want to be informed so they can co-operate on and facilitate this, be that in their back garden, their estate or their community. I mentioned biodiversity and Dr. Lynn will probably be familiar with Killiney Hill. I have spoken here several times about the red squirrel project that was launched in 2015. It was quite innovative at the time but again, local authorities are supported in this way to try to encourage greater biodiversity and protect certain species. Dalkey Island has an Arctic tern colony and I know the NPWS has been greatly involved in that. Dr. Lynn mentioned water quality and rivers. We have to make a greater effort to the ensure the quality of water in our rivers. They have improved in recent years but things like missed connections, particularly in urban areas, are a big issue. It is amazing what one missed connection can do to the quality of a river in an urban area. Dr. Lynn might speak to that point. We need to see greater progress on reforestation too. We need to protect the forests we have. Again I am speaking from an urban perspective because we need to ensure we do everything we can under the next plan to safeguard the forests we enjoy, which are used by the public as great amenities. I thank Dr. Lynn for her presentation.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Those red squirrels originate in Wexford, so Dr. Lynn is correct about this.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would also like Dr. Lynn to comment on river water quality.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay. It is more an issue for Irish Water. That is fine. I thank Dr. Lynn.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman and welcome the guests. It is good to have them in again. Obviously, our discussion is far more crucial now, given the timeframe we are in. As has been said earlier, Ireland, like most of Europe, is facing a difficult winter. Energy prices, particularly of natural gas, are a multiple of previous years. Many of us in the Dáil, as the Minister will be aware, have warned about this situation arising and it is a pity more quick fixes were not initiated, particularly for households as we face the winter, particularly in respect of small-scale retrofitting. I note the Minister's statement about the figures having doubled on 2021, particularly for those on low incomes. However, if one looks at my own area in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, only 80 out of the 4,500 local authority-owned homes have been retrofitted. The window-and-door replacement programme is on hold until 2023. While progress has been made in terms of active travel, funding has gone back to the Exchequer in that county. That is merely an example of that area, as opposed to others. The Belgian Prime Minister said that we could be facing this crisis for five to ten years. I hope he is wrong but we obviously need to support retrofitting urgently over the next couple of months. Businesses and households are facing are enormous costs and increases in prices and that is why there is much emphasis placed on budget 2023. We need to see greater increases and supports for those on fuel allowance and the continuation of reductions in VAT and duty. In terms of additional consumer protections, while the existing ones are welcome I have serious concerns regarding what was being approved by the CRU. For example, people are being told that they should reduce their peak-time usage. That is understandable, given what we have been discussing. Suppliers such as SSE Airtricity plan to increase their off-peak rates by an eye-watering 62%. There is an anomaly in Ms MacEvilly's statement. At one point, Ms MacEvilly mentioned "an accelerated decline in the availability of the current generation fleet;" and yet she went on to refer to "the retention in service of older generators". Which is it? Is it that it is crumbling and cannot be used or is it going to be saved and continue to be used? On the absence of smart meters and day-and-night meters in most households, the issue of peak and off-peak is problematic. Most consumers are on 24-hour electricity meters. It might be worthwhile considering a standard monthly allowance or tariff priced at a reasonable rate and give people the opportunity of a basic supply with graduated tariffs beyond that. I have three questions for the Minister, two questions for the CRU and two for EirGrid. For the Minister, what is the Irish gas storage capacity at present? In the event - what we heard from EirGrid - of the gas rationing in the UK in the coming winter becoming a problem and considering exports through the Moffat pipeline to Ireland are likely to be rationed as a result, what emergency measures do we have here to mitigate any gas shortages? Today's edition of the Irish Independent, raises the issue about the Corrib gas field possibly continuing until 2036 and looking at renewable options.Has the Minister met representatives of the indigenous industry since coming to office? I have some questions for the CRU and EirGrid. EirGrid indicates the annual generation capacity statement is coming in the next couple of weeks and its representatives also highlighted that since 2017, EirGrid has identified via that statement increased tightness between supply and demand and inadequate generation capacity challenges.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	How has that fallen on deaf ears for so long? I can come back in a second round of questioning.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I asked about gas storage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	There were two questions for EirGrid.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, there was the question of the 300 MW of emergency generation.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I very much thank Mr. Fenlon and his colleagues for attending. The issue of the standing charge has come up quite a bit. I ask for a note to be sent to the committee on the calculation of that charge. I have received feedback, as have colleagues on the committee, regarding people who are extremely apprehensive about having no wriggle room in respect of that charge. It has increased over the past while, so a briefing note on it would be most welcome. I will turn to an issue also raised by my colleague, Senator Dooley, namely, that of customers being told to use appliances at off-peak times - we have seen those rates increase over the past while - and what was said about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. being the hours for the cheapest rates for some of the tariffs Electric Ireland is offering. That has, for example, implications for multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, where everyone is running machines. We then get complaints regarding noise. We obviously have to consider more social hours. However, people who are trying their best to consume less energy, and at the most beneficial times as regards charges, feel snookered right now because they are being told to use energy off peak but off-peak rates are going up at a rate of knots. I ask for an answer to that. I note that €3 million has been set aside for the hardship fund. How many customers does Electric Ireland expect to avail of that? The company has earmarked that amount. It would be interesting to hear what its expectation is in that regard. Equally, on smart meters, I know that Electric Ireland works with many of the charities in the context of pay-as-you-go meters, but sometimes the problem with them is the delay in getting them installed. How many requests for pay-as-you-go meters are outstanding with Electric Ireland right now? If I have time, I will come back in later.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there an approximate figure? Electric Ireland has set aside a certain amount, so it must know, or even have a guesstimate, of how many customers it is looking at.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have just a minute left. The difficulty during Covid was that people were still in receipt of money and, in the vast majority of cases, were still working. This is a cost-of-living crisis. People may be working but they do not have enough set aside to cover the cost of energy. That number may exceed what Electric Ireland earmarked for Covid.Mr. Fenlon made a point about individuals being reluctant or maybe unable to move over to a smart meter. What is Electric Ireland doing for its existing customer base? This is a problem for all utilities. A customer who is locked into a traditional tariff does not get a call to say that there is a cheaper rate. What is Electric Ireland doing to incentivise, encourage and inform its existing customer base, notwithstanding those customers it will inherit from Panda and others that have exited the market? What is it doing to ensure that those who are already with Electric Ireland know that better tariffs are available to them?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Electric Ireland is promoting that externally. It is promoting that to all customers. What is it doing for its existing customer base? Is it doing any direct mailing or targeting to inform the existing customer base?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them very much for their engagement this afternoon. I compliment the engagement that ESB Networks has with us in the Oireachtas through the company's Oireachtas team, which is very proactive and responsive to queries. That is appreciated. In the opening statement it was mentioned that ESB Networks plans, builds, maintains and operates the electricity distribution network. It was further stated that the system is evolving and it is to become a low-carbon electricity network where 80% of the electricity generated in Ireland will come from renewable sources by 2030. We have a national target to meet and ESB Networks has a target to meet by 2030 and onward to 2050. What progress has been made to date, in particular on solar panels? What are the plans in the short term as well as the long-term strategy? I have a few others questions but I ask Mr. Tarrant to respond to that question first please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for interrupting, but is the last scheme to which Mr. Duignan referred a community-based scheme or does it relate to businesses and so on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Duignan might send on a note on those different schemes for the benefit of the committee. This is probably not in the ESB's remit and our guests might or might not be able to go into detail, but in light of recent events such as sabotage or attacks on energy systems and given the ESB is developing networks and protecting its own ones, has it reviewed its security? I am not asking our guests to go into detail but they might comment on the process in the background. What kind of security methods are there and have they been improved or reviewed in recent times given what is happening in the world?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Turning to substations, our guests mentioned earlier that 5 GW of renewable generation is connected to the electricity system and that during this year, between wind and solar, they expect that to increase to 5.4 GW. It may be EirGrid space but, in regard to the substations, is that the ESB's call for a development or proposals to go to EirGrid if it proposes that a new substation be built, or is that EirGrid coming to the ESB or another provider to say it needs a substation in a given location? Whose responsibility is it and how does that work?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Our guests mentioned solar and wind energy. I am wondering whether for offshore there needs to be a connection with a new offshore scheme. I am not sure whether it is a matter of distribution or transmission, because it could be either. Whose call is that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On the smart metering programme, it seems the ESB has made a lot of progress, with 1 million meters supplied to the market. By the end of 2024, it hopes to have the vast majority of its customers on smart meters, quite an ambitious target given the volume of customers it has. Current events will lend themselves to people requesting them, as we saw in our previous session. What is the ESB doing to ensure that it will happen by 2024? Will it be at the start of 2024 or by the end of 2024?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My final question relates to a very local issue but one that is local to all of us. It concerns lampposts throughout the country. Some of them are owned by the ESB, I understand, while others are owned by local authorities. Do not ask me how or why that happened but that is the case, according to a reply I received to a parliamentary question. How do we go about getting one of them replaced? The council will automatically direct queries to the ESB, but I have got responses from the ESB stating that some of the lampposts are owned not by it but by the councils. How can this conundrum be resolved and can we resolve it at a meeting of this committee?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was a curveball. I could outline a stream of these lamppost numbers, but that will be for another day.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank all the witnesses for attending the meeting and for their opening statements. I will stick with the last item, the district heating system. The witnesses mentioned that the Department has started a working group. I am not sure when that began, but they are hoping to report by the end of the year. It seems quite late to me to have begun such a process. Can the witnesses give a bit more information on the scope of that working group? I know they said the SEAI is working closely with them.I am familiar with the report commissioned by Dublin City Council in August 2020 that looked to Poolbeg. Is Poolbeg constructed to facilitate and contribute to a district heating system in that area at this juncture? Will it also have to be retrofitted to supply the region with a district heating system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McCarthy. Is the SEAI aware of whether Poolbeg, as it is constructed, can contribute to such a system?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	They can be joined at a time in the near future, it is hoped.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I appreciate that and I thank Ms McCarthy. The committee might follow up on the district heating system and the working group. I am sure we will discuss it again. I want to turn to the issue of deep retrofits. On the previous occasion the SEAI was before the committee, the target was 500,000 homes with 75,000 homes per annum. If I heard correctly, 25,000 homes have been done so far this year. Is this correct?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	With regard to the one-stop shops, when we initially spoke, three suppliers had been earmarked, which was putting enormous pressure on the system. There are now 12 and ten are about to join. Even so, 22 is not sufficient to cover the country. What other methods are being deployed to try to encourage people to come into the one-stop shops? As I have asked previously, what are the biggest obstacles to getting suppliers into the one-stop shops?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The 80% grant was met with much fanfare and significant interest was expressed in it. What impact is inflation having on the 80% grant, specifically in respect of attic and cavity wall insulation?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Randles or one of the other witnesses may be able to answer this-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chairman and appreciate him letting me come back in. Apologies, I had to attend another meeting. Earlier I heard the figures relating to the warmer homes scheme. They stated that 3,200 homes had been delivered so far this year, 1,300 contractors were involved with 328 to join and there were 11,300 applications with 420 in progress. If my figures are incorrect, I ask for them to be corrected. There is a waiting time of 28 months with ten months for the survey delivery. Is there scope to improve those timeframes, particularly that ten-month delay? We are talking about people who are in dire need. Many of those houses have a low energy rating to begin with but they households also are on low income. How can that process be sped up? My second question relates to the retrofitting. I have had a few queries where people are concerned that the basic retrofitting was not done to the correct standard a number of years ago. Does it automatically preclude them from the 80% grant if their house is not up to a certain specification? If the witnesses could answer those two questions, I would appreciate it.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Dr. Byrne for his reply. If, for instance, a good few years ago - Dr. Byrne is correct in that this was under a certain scheme - somebody applied for attic insulation which did not bring the property up to a specific standard, due to fact they applied for it under the previous scheme, irrespective of how good or beneficial it was, is it correct to say that they cannot re-apply under the 80%?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay, I thank our SEAI guest speakers.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In fairness to our guests, they all stood. I compliment them on their contributions today. It is not easy. Doireann went first, and it was no bother to her. It is important for all members of the committee to hear the witnesses' voices, ideas and range of experiences. The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, welcomed some of the Deputies to the Chamber of the Upper House, but after hearing today's contributions, I have no doubt that some, if not all, of the witnesses will be contributing in the years ahead in either the Seanad or in the Lower House. It was a great privilege to hear from each of them and I thank them for their contributions. I wish to touch on a number of elements, the first of which has to do with other issues. Some of the witnesses may not be from Dublin, but people across the country will have heard about the failing water quality in Dublin Bay. We used to be renowned for our high water quality, and this change is cause for concern for everyone. It is happening because of the pollution in our rivers and streams, which is ending up in our water, including our drinking water. The Minister spoke about this yesterday and it is something that we are eager to tackle. Molly mentioned the topic of water refilling stations. It is a major issue. I represent Dún Laoghaire, where fountains have started to be installed. Just as Caitlin spoke about the lack of public transport in the north west, particularly Donegal, I accept that there are not refill stations everywhere, but there need to be. Someone mentioned electric vehicle, EV, stations. I acknowledge that we have a lot of catching up to do in the coming years, but that is not to say that we are not ambitious. Our committee has the same concerns that each and every one of the witnesses has articulated well today. We work collaboratively and across party lines. Garret's point on labelling was a useful one for us to consider. Comhairle na nÓg in my constituency invited public representatives to hear about the extent of the journey taken by food products. It was an eye-opener for us all, including the participants from Comhairle na nÓg. Garret was practical in acknowledging that small firms might not have the wherewithal or capacity where labelling was concerned. A voluntary scheme could work well. Customers, consumers and citizens all want to play their part in alleviating the worst effects of climate change. A labelling system could help with that and this idea needs to be explored. A number of the witnesses referred to the circular economy. It is an issue that I am passionate about and that the committee has discussed at length in recent months. There is a lack of awareness. As with EVs and water, people want to contribute and make things better. Molly mentioned a lack of awareness. People want to dispose of their waste correctly and for certain products to have better lifespans. Manufacturers, governments and consumers have a collective role to play in this regard to ensure that there is either an ending or reduction of fast fashion and people feel empowered to use and reuse products, including second-hand clothes and so on. That all needs to be done as a matter of course without any stigma attached to it. It bothers me to hear that there is still stigma. So many high streets now have charity shops and second-hand clothes shops. From my reckoning, there are doing well. I thank the witnesses for their contributions and for attending this meeting. I thank everyone in the Gallery. I also thank the Seanad for hosting us.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Acting Chairperson referred to Connecting Ireland, very important infrastructure the Government is focused on delivering. Nevertheless, I hear Doireann on the issue of cost, whether from Donegal, Bandon or anywhere else. It is astronomical. We are talking about an additional €10, on top of the €65, as well as the cost to get from the house to the station. It is astronomical and prohibitive. Our guests are the core bunch of activists who do not want to pollute the air. They want either to cycle where possible, to walk or at least to use public transport. We want to work with them and that is another benefit of this meeting. Where there is public transport, the costs have fallen but there remain huge gaps in the service, which we recognise, and we will continue to push for further connectivity. The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, a party colleague of mine, was in attendance earlier and he speaks about his constituency, Mayo, where there are huge gaps in service, along with Galway, which the Acting Chairperson mentioned. I do not want to cover only public transport, given our guests raised many different issues, but as a committee member, I will take away several of the points and we will see what we can do over the coming months to work either with existing proposals in legislation or to further their cause through other acts of the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Acting Chairperson is telling them that only now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise for my delay in engaging with the witnesses. I welcome them back. It is good to engage again. I will focus on one specific area, namely, the inputting of one's own data on the various portals supplied by the utility companies. Has the CRU had any complaints about the effectiveness of some of the portals? Some of them appear to be down. I have got information into my office here regarding the experience of some people who have gone to submit meter readings, especially around a deadline before Christmas when people were asked to submit their readings before a certain date to avail of lower tariffs. When they did go to do that a day or two before the deadline, some websites were down. Is this something that has come to the attention of the CRU? If so, what has and can be done about this? I have received quite a number of queries regarding this matter since our last engagement and I thought I would raise it here.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This was a particular pinch point for obvious reasons in respect of the tariffs changing. I have since had queries, however, about these portals being down. There is the ESB Networks' portal as well, but regarding the suppliers themselves it is important these services are maintained. This is why I am asking the regulator about this. It is something the CRU seems to be aware of. What can be done about it? A note might be sent to the committee with a response in terms of the extent to which the organisation is aware of this issue. Obviously, it would not be aware of the minute issues that the customer care service teams of the various utility companies would be aware of, but for those cases the CRU is aware of, I would like a note to be prepared for the committee and circulated after this engagement. That would be appreciated.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes. It is good to hear about the progress being made with the smart meters. It seems there has been quite a bit of progress made since our last engagement. It was projected that we would be around this point at this time, but it is good to hear concrete evidence that half, or more than half, of customers have availed of these smart meters. This is very good. I thank the witnesses again for their engagement today and for their opening statement.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses and the committee members for this slot. I will probably have another opportunity to talk to the EPA at the climate action committee about the new legislation on packaging, etc. However, today, I would like to raise a few issues, the first of which relates to noise and noise complaints. This is a frequent issue that constituents raise with us as public representatives. I wonder about the EPA's interaction with local authorities about the level - no pun intended - of noise complaints. Have they increased substantially over the last number of years? How does that fit in? Senator Garvey spoke about inland waterways, water pollution in general, foul water discharge and misconnections. In an urban area such as Dún Laoghaire, there is a large number of misconnections in small waterways. The witnesses might not have the information today, but they might correspond with the committee on the percentage of misconnections in urban areas, as it is an issue. Dr. Minihan mentioned Irish Water and its plans. Sea or bathing water quality is an important issue. As the EPA knows, Irish Water has plans to try to deal with some of the treatment plans. The water quality in Dublin Bay at times is not sufficient. I wonder how the EPA can work with Irish Water on that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Byrne mentioned Irish Water. I have a question about what happens when water quality is not sufficient and there is a "water off" notice. There was a recent experience in Blackrock where an area had no water for 12 days. I appreciate that this is more in the domain of Irish Water. However, I do not understand and am not happy that after 12 days residents were told that water was safe to drink again, but no explanation was given to them. From the EPA's perspective, surely that is not sufficient.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is correct, but the communication following the initial notice was poor. I would expect that the EPA would communicate to Irish Water that a follow-up to those consumers is vital to reassure them. Irish Water should also inform them of exactly what happened.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes, it does. I apologise to the Chairman for the delay, as I was attending another meeting. I thank the Minister for his time and it is good to talk to him again. My apologies if some of these questions have already been answered but I understand from Deputy O'Sullivan that perhaps the Minister has touched on this before. If he will excuse me I will ask the question in any event as I did not hear the answer. On the district heating and community energy type schemes, I was with a local group in my own constituency about three weeks ago and it was looking at renewable electricity support schemes. Those who have already taken the plunge and retrofitted their homes are looking to put power back into the grid. Where are we at with this possibility at present? How far off are we with that particular initiative?  The Minister spoke of when we get to certain point that there will be many people looking to retrofit their homes and rightly so. We are near enough to that point already and the skills are not there to deal with the demand. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the SEAI and I too have constituents who have been waiting for an enormous amount of time to be able to draw down the fund, let alone get the work done, and this is another hurdle for them. On the SEAI and its staffing levels, additional funding has been given to it to manage this programme. Can the Minister elaborate on the SEAI's progress in respect of its recruitment? On the practical side of getting all this rolled out, which is really important, how much co-operation is there between the Minister's own Department and, for example, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage? We spoke about local authority housing. In my own constituency in the county council of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the authority has done an enormous amount of work. All of the buildings are highly rated for energy efficiency. Some of the newer developments actually meet the standards for passive housing. Some of the housing is really old stock. The Minister is right about the cost-benefit analysis. It is really difficult to do one house because, for example, some in a terrace may have been purchased. We are really down to the bottom of the barrel, the expensive part, in trying to get as many of those houses as possible done. What co-operation or links exist between the Minister's Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, with regard to apprenticeships? Will the Minister touch on those points?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	With regard to the community energy schemes, those who have already done it now have excess power they want to sell back to the grid. Where are we in that regard? In terms of supporting communities that want to come together and support each other through energy sharing and so on, where are we with that at the present time?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Following on from Deputy Whitmore on river quality, I note the Minister has allocated €33.3 million in programme D, which is very welcome. Will the Minister outline the Department's involvement and the co-operation it has with Irish Water, the EPA, many local authorities and Waterways Ireland, for example? One of the big issues in urban areas relates to misconnections into the local rivers and there is also the grey run-off water matter from roads and so on because some of the older roads and gulleys still empty into local rivers. While river water quality has improved over the years, there remains a serious risk to biodiversity in and around the rivers. Will the Minister comment on future programmes of his Department designed to tackle grey run-off water waste from roads, factories and so on, and those misconnections? What is in the pipeline - excuse the pun - for the Department working with all the agencies I mentioned?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. I share the Minister's concern about Dublin Bay. He is correct that a capital programme by Irish Water is under way. I am wondering about the funding from the Minister's Department, particularly for the EPA, Waterways Ireland and so on. He might revert to me after the meeting to emphasise the issue. Local authorities do fantastic work monitoring river water quality but it is important that at every turn we try to prevent those misconnections and that grey water running into the rivers. That will also prevent from happening what the Minister described happening in Dublin Bay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On programme E, I welcome the €50 million allocated for the EPA. This touches on the issue we discussed under programme D. Remediation of landfill sites is an issue, particularly in urban areas. The €26 million provided for this is very welcome. I will focus on the sum of €10.2 million for waste management initiatives that seek to increase awareness of the necessity to minimise waste and increase recycling. What is the Government doing to reduce packaging? It is key that we reduce packaging before we talk about recycling. Excess waste through packaging must be tackled. Will some of the €10.2 million go towards initiatives in that area? If not, what funding will be provided for this purpose? Is the Government talking to manufacturers here and abroad to reduce packaging? The public do not want so much packaging when their packages arrive because they must pay the cost of disposal. We would do ourselves a favour if we tackled the issue of packaging before products reach supermarket shelves.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Before we get started on that, I wish to ask about a procedural issue. I confirm that I am in Leinster House. What happens if the proposers of amendments are not present? Do the amendments fall or can they be discussed later?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I concur with my colleagues and thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your stewardship. I also thank the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, for their engagement. I thank all my colleagues, not only the members of this committee but everybody who contributed to Committee Stage. It was robust in terms of the volume of amendments that was proposed but it was a good day's work in terms of getting through it. Well done to you, Chairman, for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Cathaoirleach agus an Aire Stáit. I thank him for the run-through of these estimates. I refer to subhead C6 which is the waste management programmes. I see a near doubling of that fund. Will the Minister of State elaborate on what the additional increase is and what it is due to be spent on?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Okay.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and I appreciate that. I will explain the reason for the question. The Minister of State will be aware from our constituency of the issue of the north beach in Bray, as indeed will Deputy Whitmore, and the funding that has been required to maintain that particular former landfill site. When she asked her question on landfill remediation it prompted a concern about the waste management programme and what that entailed when I saw an increase. However, if it is a reallocation, that is fine. Let us just hope the funding continues because it is much needed for those sites.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 9, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:"(c) contains more than 10 per cent plastic,".At the outset, I am pleased that the Minister of State is engaging with the amendments and is willing to accept some of them, although my first one fell at the first hurdle. Let us hope there are other opportunities for inclusion in the Bill. In terms of utilising our time, it would also be helpful to know which ones the Minister of State is going to accept if this is feasible because it will help us have a debate around the ones that are not going to be accepted about why they should be included. This amendment is self-explanatory. While I hear what the Minister of State said about my first amendment, this is similar but I do not propose to defer to the EU single-use plastic strategy on this. We must be realistic in our outlook regarding what might materialise in terms of being manufactured. We could be walking ourselves into a bigger problem down the line irrespective of what legislation comes from the EU. This is a sensible amendment and I ask the Minister of State to consider it. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Basically, I am in agreement with Deputy Bruton regarding the compilation of many of these products and the materials used. I will speak to the three amendments together. They are from the same area of the Bill on page 16, just on different lines. Ultimately, this is about stitching in a kind of a polluter pays principle. My big concern is potentially seeing manufactured products such as single-use cups that are not actually reusable in the long term or are keepable by the consumer. We are walking ourselves into a bigger problem here. We have to be cautious, particularly in respect of amendment No. 35. The Bill currently provides for a sum of not “less than €0.20 or more than €1.00”. I am a little bit dubious about whether we should be so prescriptive in primary legislation. However, that said, we should perhaps put in what is in the amendment, which is “less than €.01 or more than €1.00, which would be determined by the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item.” We have to be conscious that manufacturers may look to substitute for alternative goods, which in the long run is actually not environmentally good, and was said earlier, may have unintended consequences. I ask the Minister of State to consider those amendments, along with amendments Nos. 34 and 36.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, but I might reintroduce it on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 16:"In page 10, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following: “(b) reductions in plastic single use items according to the waste hierarchy within EU Waste Directive 2008/98 and Commission Implementation Regulation (EU) 2020/2151 Single Use plastic Directive,”.I will withdraw the amendment. I might reintroduce it on Report Stage. The Chair might read out the amendments that the Minister has given, so that we know which ones have been accepted or are going to be accepted. That might help.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I do not think it would be that big, in fairness.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 16, line 23, after “available” to insert the following:“and if the levels of material wastage of the single-use item do not adhere to the principles as outlined in EU Waste Directive 2008/98 regarding lifecycle justification and the best overall environmental outcome in regard to achieving the lowest carbon dioxide emissions and freshwater consumption”.I will return to the amendment on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 16, line 32, to delete “less than €0.20 or more than €1.00” and substitute the following:“less than €0.01 or more than €1.00, which will be determined by the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item”.Likewise, I intend to return to this amendment on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 36:In page 16, line 32, after “€1.00” to insert the following:“and be applied on a pro-rata basis according to the total percentage of plastic content within the material of the single-use item”.I also intend to return this amendment on Report Stage.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Amendment No. 41 will change the wording from "suitable" to "recyclable", which will encourage and create what the Minister of State is hoping to do, namely, to have the circular economy fully operational. It is a matter of wording. Similarly, amendment No. 42 seeks to encourage better outcomes than those that flow from the existing single-use alternatives. The Minister of State might outline what kind of engagement has happened with industry and business. While there were no amendments under the levies, there are concerns about the full implication and impact the Bill will have, on both manufacturing and disposal.There really is a need to ensure that any levies are pro rata to discourage the disposal of products that have a longer lifespan. I heard what the Minister of State said about the paper versus plastic cup, for example, but my fear is that the consequence of some elements of this Bill would be that products would be advertised as reusable but their flimsiness would be such that they would not actually be reused or retained by the customer but would be discarded. That is not something that I, the Minister of State, or anyone else on this committee wants to see but there is a genuine fear within the sector. The Minister of State said he would engage with café owners but many of the elements of this Bill will come as a surprise not only to business owners, but also to consumers, given the speed with which it has come to this committee. In that context, I ask the Minister of State to outline the engagement he has had with industry and business. I also ask him to respond to amendments Nos. 42 and 43. Separately, I cannot find the list of amendments that the Minister of State proposes to accept. Is it available on Microsoft Teams? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 41:In page 21, line 3, after “suitable” where it firstly occurs to insert “recyclable”.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 21, line 4, after “wastage” to insert the following:“that provides a better environmental outcome demonstrated through life-cycle thinking compared to the existing single-use alternative”. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State for his comments on industry and businesses. While I heard his welcome remarks in respect of IBEC, Food Drink Ireland and other organisations, on the other end of the circular economy, has there been engagement with waste disposal companies? If so, how recent was that engagement? He referred to the levy going to public consultation and whatever else. As regards other charges relating to the waste industry, will a similar approach be taken with waste contractors? I refer to levies in respect of certain materials going to landfill rather than incineration, etc. Is that kind of engagement going to happen? I am looking at some of the proposed charges. Is there going to be change in the context of keeping that parity between the various waste streams?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What impact will that have on the Bill? Will there be changes to the legislation in respect of items going to landfill rather than incineration or being recycled? At the moment, there are different levels of charges for different materials. If that is going to change, will that engagement happen after the enactment of the Bill?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	If they send me a note, that will be fine.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	Apologies have been received from the Cathaoirleach of the committee, Deputy Brian Leddin, and Deputy Alan Farrell. The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29. I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex. In this regard, I ask all members to confirm prior to making their contributions that they are on the grounds of Leinster House. In accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate. I call on the Minister of State to make his opening statement, which will be followed by questions and answers.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister of State and open the floor to any members who may have questions on the Supplementary Estimate.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I call Deputy Bríd Smith.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I thank Deputy Bríd Smith. As I was giving Deputy Leddin’s apologies earlier, he walked through the door. He is welcome.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	While some of my questions have already been asked, I will seek clarity on certain aspects. On the €90 million savings, in response to a few questions, the Minister of State outlined the forecast of €23 million in savings from the one-stop shop and the community energy schemes. I also heard his comments about the target perhaps not being met this year due to supply chain issues but that it will be caught up with in 2023, which is understandable. In terms of the retrofitting schemes, we heard about solar panels going into homes for those who have medical needs and, obviously, a higher energy requirement, as well as for those on lower incomes. Does the Minister of State have any specifics or data from his officials -I realise that this is not his portfolio - about the number of houses in respect of which progress has been made with solar panels, even down to attic insulation and draught excluders, and anything to try to improve the energy efficiency of homes in the calendar year 2022? Does the Minister of State have data on that?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	From our perspective, it is frustrating that we are trying to discuss the Supplementary Estimate and yet we do not have the information we require. It is not the Minister of State's fault-----
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	I know. I refer to the better energy warmer homes scheme specifically for the elderly. I and every other member of this committee have constituents who have applied for these initiatives, which are very welcome, but there is a backlog in that specific scheme. I am sure if that is the Minister of State's experience too. Does the saving that we are talking about, the supply chain issues, relate to that scheme as well? Is it all the schemes operated by the one stop shop in the SEAI or is it a particular scheme?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	It has. Unfortunately, even after the briefings we still do not get a result. After the announcement of the improved grants, which was very welcome, the public responded with gusto because they wanted to avail of them, only to find that there was no capacity in either the one-stop shop or the subsequent suppliers. There are other issues curtailing the roll-out of those schemes so we hope to see an improvement on that in late 2022 and early 2023. To return to the solar panels, this is something I raised with the Minister last week in the Dáil,. I hope the officials will refer it back to the Department. There is an expectation on the part of people, particularly those who are hard-pressed in advance of winter, to avail of improvements to their homes. We need to prioritise that. I will turn to the electricity grant. The Minister of State highlighted the grant in the context of subhead 11. He indicated that the remaining unallocated funding by the suppliers must be returned by ESBN to the Department by the end of July. Was the amount €20 million?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	It that because there was an overestimation in respect of the grant? People could not avoid availing of it. It was there in their accounts. I know that some could gift it back. Where did that €20 million come from?
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	To go back to the point about the sub-meters, there was a fair point made about halting sites and other multi-unit developments. Some people did not actually get the credit for one reason or another. Perhaps they had moved house or they live in these multi-unit developments or dwellings. What is the process for them? Do the officials have any advice for how they avail of that credit? Some of them have not received it yet.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	There is a lot of information to come back to the committee following its examination of the Supplementary Estimate. Obviously, more detail on the 450 MW of additional generation capacity would be very helpful. There are no further questions from Deputies for the Minister of State. I thank him and the officials for their engagement.
CormacDevlin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Cormac Devlin)	2020-02-08	None	In accordance with Standing Order 101 the following message will be sent to the Dáil:The Select Committee on Environment and Climate Action has completed its consideration of the Supplementary Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2022: Vote 29 - Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Regarding the €7 million mentioned, there is concern about the money that has already been given to local authorities for active travel in the context of those local authorities that have not spent it. A great deal of money has been returned to the Department, as he is aware. What is being done to bulk-up the number of staff to ensure local authorities have the correct resources to spend the money being allocated to them? It is unfair that this money is being allocated to them and they cannot spend it. In situations where some local authorities do not spend money, I think I heard the Minister say the money will be spent by other local authorities-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am sorry. The €7 million was referred to in the Minister statement and I thought this related to active travel. Perhaps it is related to climate measures instead. It was actually climate mitigation that was referred to, but I do not have a copy of the Minister's statement. I ask him to elaborate on what is being done in respect of resources for local authorities. I am conscious of situations, and using the analogy of active travel, where money is given to local authorities but then some of that money is being returned nearly as fast to the Minister's Department. Turning to group schemes, where several tenants are on such a group scheme, what is being done to relieve the pressure on them under the current measures? In addition, and similar to the point made regarding the Traveller community, what can be done for people living in situations where they need assistance and they may be on a shared meter in multi-unit developments?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	What can be done for those in group schemes and multi-unit developments that share a meter?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I understand why the Minister does not want to detail the two sides that are earmarked for the emergency generation, but in the briefing note that we received it is obviously up to the winter of 2025-26. Does he envisage that we will need additional capacity after that if the circumstances continue between now between now and then?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Returning to the emergency power generation scheme, I note that there is €150 million allocated to it. There is another €150 million added to subhead B13, which is the energy transformation programme. On something we spoke about previously, has the Minister explored and engaged with the existing infrastructure to try to keep what we have already, expanding the life span of existing sites around the country to ensure that there is a supply of gas and other materials? Has that happened in tandem with looking at new sites for energy generation? The Minister might come back on that and then I will have other questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thought the Minister mentioned the Corrib gasfield in one of his responses earlier. Has that been explored with a view to extending it? Is that being considered?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fair enough. The Minister mentioned a plan for maritime development and climate action, including the establishment of a marine and climate directorate. He said his Department is committing €1 million. It is envisaged it will be €3.5 million in a once-off fund for this year to support the setup of that function. Will the Minister elaborate more on that marine and climate directorate?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the establishment of that directorate, if only €1 million is being committed to it this year, does that jeopardise the applications for offshore wind? Obviously, from what the Minister is saying, An Bord Pleanála does not possess the skills right now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Minister.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. I am substituting for a committee member. I have a number of questions on Vote 34 specifically. Some are for the Minister and others for the Minister of State. I note a further €275.8 million in capital has been carried over from 2021. I am assuming that is related to an underspend caused by the pandemic. It is also noted that a little over €92 million will be available from the Local Government Fund. Turning specifically to the €2.53 billion allocated for expenditure, there is, I believe, a figure for programme B, which is water. The Chairman mentioned Arklow but I am also conscious of water quality in Dublin Bay. Irish Water has a particular programme under way for refurbishing and improving treatment plants. Is funding provided for that in programme B, under capital to Irish Water? Programme F deals with conservation. There are various conservation funds, including the historical structures fund, the architectural structures fund and the annual funds administered by the local authorities. Are they included in programme F. Subhead F11 deals with climate adaptation. Is there an increase in funding under that subhead?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank our guests for their statements. The arts and culture sector will probably be one of the last to reopen and it has faced a number of challenges, like many other sectors. Some of the supports the sector is receiving were outlined by Ms Licken in her opening remarks. I would like to focus on the arts and crafts and cultural sectors and what supports there will be for them. I welcome the confirmation from Ms Licken of the €20 million allocated to the Arts Council, as requested by the National Campaign for the Arts, NCAF, and that recommendations have been achieved. Could she expand on what is being done in that sphere? Ms Banotti mentioned the work and creativity of the local authorities. The work done by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I was a member, on libraries and creativity in the arts was innovative. We need to see more of it and the support will be welcome. Ms Banotti stated there was funding for care homes. Will the social day care centre be included in that, if and when it is up and running? There are different settings for older people who need entertainment or require a change in their day-to-day living, and the arts are a very important aspect of that. Ms Banotti might expand on that. I turn to Ms Licken in respect of the production and performance arts sectors. As far as I am aware, there is no clear pathway for those sectors and they are worried as of today. While the funding through the Arts Council is welcome, more clarity needs to be given to those in that sector. The crafts sector, which I mentioned earlier, also seems to have been forgotten about. Much work has gone into Creative Ireland and the funding has been welcome. It is great that it has been repurposed so quickly but, again, there may be some questions as to how that funding will be rolled out. On the actions recommended by the NCAF, Mr. Falvey stated the officials were analysing the reports from the Arts Council expert advisory group on the NCAF and that some recommendations have been achieved. Will he elaborate on that? Mr. Kelly mentioned the tourism recovery task force in his opening remarks. He might comment on the implementation of the plan. Much of the discussion, even this morning on national radio, has been about holidaying at home, rightly so, and the supports for the domestic tourism sector. I welcome the advertising campaign and the quick response to the need to encourage staycations. Will Mr. Kelly expand on the capacity in the system? Summer has been truncated a little into just July and August in Ireland, and there will be challenges with accommodating everybody who wishes to stay at home this summer.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Kelly was to respond to some questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is good to hear. I thank Mr. Kelly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Makhlouf and Mr. O'Connor are very welcome. I have three questions for Mr. Makhlouf. The Central Bank's quarter 3 bulletin shows the bank's anticipation of a 9% contraction in GDP for 2020 but a return to growth of 5.7% next year. My first question is on whether Mr. Makhlouf, as Governor, considered the impact of a potential second wave on the stability of the financial system. Has stress-testing been done for the banks? Is Mr. Makhlouf satisfied that they have robust capital reserves?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The issue of insurance policies has been to the fore over the past number of weeks, particularly business interruption insurance. We are hearing widespread reports of insurance companies failing to pay out for claims on business interruption insurance. What is Mr. Makhlouf's view on this and what is the insurance supervision directorate of the Central Bank doing to ensure insurance companies act fairly? Will the Central Bank review this policy?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I applaud the Governor's efforts. Hopefully, they will continue. I thank Mr. Makhlouf for that because, as he states, it is a real issue facing many businesses. It has come to the surface more as they start to reopen and go back into operation. The Governor outlined two scenarios: a return to growth and that of a more pessimistic view. What is the Governor's view about the impact of both on the housing market here for the foreseeable future?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I will turn to Mr. O'Connor quickly. The recent bond issuance at a low or negative yield is welcome. I acknowledge the work of the NTMA, only made possible with the ECB keeping the interest rates low. Mr. O'Connor mentioned that he expected interest rates to remain low for the foreseeable future, with the risk of rates increasing in the future. What consideration is being given to very long-term bonds, such as 30, 50 or 100 years, to deal with this once-in-100 year event?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses today and thank them for their time and their opening remarks. I do not think anybody can underestimate the challenges faced by schools. The immediate question facing parents, in particular, in March when the schools closed was how long this was going to last. Ultimately, as it went on longer and longer, the question turned to how this is going to change and how the schools are going to reopen. I welcome the remarks and I heard Mr. Mongey this morning on radio outlining some of the challenges. I want to put on record my own appreciation for many teachers who have done exemplary work in these challenging times. Mr. Mongey mentioned in his opening remarks the issue of equity for schools. We have to recognise that not every school, not every learner and not every child has the same access, unfortunately, to the equipment required to have what Mr. Mongey termed "blended learning".Online is no substitute for the classroom and we need to get to the point of flushing out all those issues. The resource bundle dated July of this year includes 194 checks, many of which point to the school leaders looking for supports within the school. I get nervous when I see that because those are 194 reasons not to reopen schools. While I welcome the positive guarded comments about reopening schools, and it is important to start from that position, parents, in particular, want to know how and when it will be done. I speak as a father of three, but having been contacted by countless parents who have been in the position, either trying to work from home or maybe doing shift work from home, of trying to teach their children. The international evidence shows the continued closure of schools will have an impact on our children. That is why I emphasise the need to reopen, particularly, as I have said, where children do not have access to IT equipment. It is critical that schools reopen. In the view of each of the organisations, what exactly is required to open our schools come September?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Mongey is there on screen, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will ask Mr. Clerkin the same question. I will add to it what Mr. Mongey referred to, namely, the additional cost. Every business that reopened and any entity that has had to reopen to the public incurred additional costs. One would accept that, but there is also a requirement of additional space stated in the roadmap. Mr. Clerkin might touch on it. Certain schools had plans for school extensions that were due to be constructed over the summer months and that did not happen.Portakabins were also due to arrive, but that may not be happening. I would like the views of the witnesses on those issues. None of this can happen without funding. Can anyone put a figure on the funding being sought? Mr. Mongey referred to the cleaner, and I heard him speak about that earlier. I do not know how long a school with 1,000 students has had one cleaner. Covid-19 or no Covid-19, that does not seem tenable. Given the costs ultimately associated with all these documents and all the discussions that are happening, what kind of funding are we talking about? I ask Mr. Clerkin to answer those questions, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Clerkin and Mr. Mongey for their remarks. As long as that can-do attitude can remain, people will be a little bit more at ease with the whole process. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome our guests and thank them for their attendance and remarks, particularly the Secretary General and his colleagues. I welcome the change in culture and message that if people are sick, they should stay away, and the remarks about the number one priority of the Department being reopening the schools. It is a good place to start. I spoke with a number of the teacher representatives who were here on Tuesday. It is good to see that everybody is on the same side. My first question is for the Secretary General. How soon after Covid hit did planning begin on the reopening of schools?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ó Foghlú for that. Assuming everything goes to plan and schools are reopened in September, I note this morning there is talk of additional funding for both substitute teachers and the cleaning of schools. While Mr. Ó Foghlú touched on cleansing earlier in response to some of the questions, does he have a figure for the amount of additional money the Department is talking about, particularly for those principals who may be watching and wondering about additional teachers? We know there is a challenge in securing substitute teachers at the best of times. Can Mr. Ó Foghlú touch on the cost of this?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Once complete and issued to schools, will this roadmap help the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the roadmap needed for special schools and children or adults with disabilities? Will Mr. Ó Foghlú's Department work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Very good. I have just two more questions for the Secretary General and then two for Mr. Loftus. I might as well ask them all together. The first concerns after-school activities. What is the likely guidance to schools on after-school or extracurricular activities based on school premises? The second question is more of a perennial issue, which is the weight of schoolbags. Perhaps this is an opportunity for schools to apply to a fund for lockers to try to enable pupils to leave schoolbooks on the school premises. Obviously, there is a health and safety benefit in the context of Covid if schoolbooks are left on the premises and not taken back home when not necessary.I have a couple of questions for Mr. Loftus in relation to school space and accommodation. If the school itself is small and social distancing is impossible, will there be a fund available for either renting additional space or providing additional space, be it Portakabins or whatever? Is that in the pipeline? Second, if a school has small numbers but the school building is large and there is a possibility of splitting the classes, will there be an opportunity for schools to apply for additional teachers so that those class numbers can be reduced, bearing in mind that some of the class sizes exceed the normal class sizes? They might come back to me on those.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, if I may, where the schools have the space and where there is a possibility of facilitating those classrooms, I urge the Department to try to ensure that a fund is made available to those schools to employ additional teachers in order that those class sizes are reduced and, indeed, the space is given for socially-distanced education.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McGinley and Ms McKeown for their attendance today as well as for their contributions and opening statements which were enlightening and are much appreciated. This issue, as they are well aware, came to public prominence at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire we do not have meat processing plants. It does not directly affect my area but that is not a reason to be here or not to be here. I welcome the fact Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is here and this is a very good forum in which to air the issues they have highlighted. I would go so far as to say that this is not, unfortunately, isolated to meat processing or any type of industry for that matter. Looking at this from the point of view of the work permits, which Ms McGinley touched on in her remarks, reform needs to happen because as she highlighted the employees are very much attached to the employer. That in itself brings issues. It is fine if the employer is a good employer but there is a huge problem with the not so good ones. That needs to be dealt with across the board. Could Ms McGinley and Ms McKeown elaborate on sectoral work permits and how they envisage those, particularly for non-EU workers? They also touched on the HSA inspections. Do they know how many were carried out during the height of the pandemic, bearing in mind that Ms McGinley gave a date of, I think, 15 May for guidelines being issued? On those guidelines, we are talking about people who feel isolated and cut off and almost beholden to the employer or the business they work for. Are the witnesses aware of those guidelines being issued in different languages? I am not aware of whether they were, and that is why I am asking. Ms McGinley and Ms McKeown might answer those questions and I might then come back in with some others.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I commend the work that Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is doing because without it, many of these people would be voiceless and would feel vulnerable. It is important that Ms McGinley is able to voice their concerns. I have not visited a meat packing or processing plant but I would hope the yellow signage with which we are all now familiar, such as is right here beside me and everywhere one goes, would be multilingual and that there would be particular advice for these types of industries. In its submission, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland stated that the CSO figures for 2016 show there were 12,413 employees in the sector, and around 42% of them were migrant workers. However, when work permits are added in on top of that, the figure is 15,338 and 58% of the sector are migrant workers. We are talking about quite a high volume of individuals who are potentially low-skilled and low-paid. What I said at the outset about the meat-packing industry being almost like a cluster for Covid may have been an incorrect portrayal but certainly the public perception was that were many issues in meat-packing plants. My concern is now about the inspections being announced. No one involved in the hospitality industry ever gets advance notice of a health inspector coming in and rightly so because one needs to see warts and all in order to address concerns. I am very worried if advance notice of inspections is being given because it means we will not get to the root of the problem. I was surprised at the accommodation figures because anecdotally, many people who are low-paid live together and that, therefore, would almost account for more of the cluster than the workplace. I hope this is not the last time we get to engage. I hope we can achieve much of the reform the witnesses are seeking and I appreciate their time and comments.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was remiss of me not to thank all of those working in the meat plants because it was one of the sectors, as the witnesses highlighted in their remarks, that kept going throughout the height of the pandemic. This should be acknowledged. Whatever scheme the employer or the State looks at it is certainly warranted to acknowledge appreciation. Ms McGinley said that not all factories and companies are in the same boat. We are having quite a pessimistic conversation about the meat sector but it does not involve every factory. In saying this, there are some that are particularly persistent with light-touch regulation and those are the ones we need to home in on. It has also been mentioned that there could be some undocumented workers and, particularly with the advance notification of inspections, people being told not to come in or conveniently going off shift for a little while. Will the witnesses speak about the evidence they have of this or the experiences they have been told about to enlighten us on these issues?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Of course not.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Absolutely. We now see that the R-nought is close to 1. That is alarming in itself, but if there were a second wave - I am reading a statement for our next session - do the witnesses think things would improve, or have they improved already? Surely the figures for the past couple of weeks indicate that all factories seem to have got on board and realised that this has to be dealt with. In addition, the number of inspections increased and the public spotlight was on the sector so, naturally, improvements happened. If, however, there were a second wave, we would have to be conscious of what we have just experienced. If the witnesses are saying the majority of all plants now have temperature controls and all the other facilities, that is welcome. However, is Ms McGinley confident, just from her experience, that the sector would continue to comply as it is complying today if there were a second wave?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Equally, from Ms McGinley's own experience, from what she has been told and from what her organisation has learned about those who reported symptoms of illness, regardless of whether it was thought to be Covid, and those who actually reported sick, can she enlighten us on her experience with workers who have come to her organisation with those experiences?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am asking about people who have reported sick or as having felt symptoms. What was their experience with the willingness of their employers to allow a day off or testing of the employee? What measures were taken to prevent a potential spread? This is the advice to which we are all adhering now.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Finally, did the witnesses see a spike in the number of cases they were dealing with in their regular work at the outset compared with the height of the pandemic? Has this given them a massive surge in case numbers? I am assuming it has but I would just like confirmation of that.How many are we talking about? How many cases has the MRCI dealt with from March to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Carroll and the other representatives from MII for attending today. I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was responsible, before her appointment and as a member of this committee, for inviting MII in today. They are very welcome and I thank them for their opening remarks. Following on from the earlier session, I will ask about the levels of meat produced in the sector normally and that produced during the Covid pandemic. Is Mr. Carroll aware of any rapid increase in production? 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is there a contact tracing register in place in each company or factory? Will Mr. Carroll enlighten the committee in that regard?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Is Mr. Carroll saying that each factory or processor has a Covid officer? If so, what guidelines are issued to such officers and the owner of the factory or facility? Are the guidelines being communicated to staff? As we heard during the previous session, there are language barriers for some staff. Have the guidelines been translated into other languages so that all staff are aware of the various protocols and practices required within the factories?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	First, were those protocols communicated to all of the agents or companies? Second, were the companies notified in advance of the HSA inspections?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Unannounced inspections are probably better, but I acknowledge the level of compliance Mr. Carroll outlined in his statement. Did MII view and approve all the protocols with regard to the Covid policies that had gone out to contractors? Were MII members available to public health teams for scrutiny?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Were the MII companies, the operators themselves, available to public health teams for scrutiny?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Carroll for those answers. How does he think the meat plants are capable of responding to a potential second wave of Covid? Does he think the current guidelines are sufficient, and will they remain in place?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Good morning to the witnesses. I thank them for their attendance today. We have all received calls from people in distress and in need of mental health services. I note that approximately 90% of the mental health services are provided through GP care or primary care teams. The remainder are provided by the community mental health teams. What has been the volume of the increase since the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland, in particular since mid-March?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to the previous question on the WHO recommendation that 12% of health service budgets be spent on mental health services and in Ireland we spend in and around 7% as I heard said. Does Mr. Rogan have a percentage breakdown of the age and gender of those he has seen in the past 12 months or so or has there been an increase in any particular cohort seeking mental health services? Mr. Rogan mentioned young people, for example. One of the common issues we all come across is the dual diagnosis case of those who may have a drug addiction as well as mental health issues. What is the panel's overall view on how we go forward in treating that? Is the lack of funding going into mental health services a barrier to that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank everybody for those responses. We spoke about primary healthcare services. I would say they are patchy, to say the least, in certain parts of the country. My fear is for those who live in areas where they cannot avail of services and also in terms of the strain on GPs across the country. That could create barriers, unfortunately, for those who are trying to access services. That is an important element in terms of either funding to assist with that or for the review of services. I thank Ms Mitchell for her comments on Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone. There is certainly a need to see the implementation of that as soon as possible.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations today. It was interesting and I thank them for providing the report in advance. I represent Dún Laoghaire in the Dáil and one of the big issues I have had over the years has been the staffing resource for community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6. It has been difficult to retain and recruit staff in various departments, but I want to look specifically at CAMHS and how the children and adolescent sector is resourced. Will the HSE comment on the overall recruitment process? I do not want to be too parochial but will the HSE comment on how the level of staffing for mental health services has been filled so far?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I am conscious of the time but I thank Dr. Doody for that response. I appeal to the director and to the staff from the HSE in particular to keep that focus on south Dublin. I have been aware of the challenges for many years but I ask them to redouble the efforts to retain and recruit staff for the CHO and the wider field. In the earlier session, I raised the issue of dual diagnosis. A problem that arises time and again is in terms of people who have an addiction but who also have mental health issues. Could the witnesses comment on that? Primary healthcare services are patchy, to say the least, across the country. Some areas have a functioning primary healthcare service and a centre but others do not, and that presents challenges. Finally, to the witnesses from the Mental Health Commission, it is stated on page 17 of the report we received in advance of this meeting that the commission was reporting on a weekly basis to the Department of Health. If a second wave of Covid-19 were to hit or just in general the coming weeks or months, is that likely to continue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	On a weekly basis, yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the disability organisations and the commission. I thank them for their opening remarks. All the members of the committee have been contacted by families and people with disabilities, especially during the pandemic and in this particular phase. Mr. Egan referred to carer and family burnout. Many of those people have experienced that or are experiencing it at present. Only last week, I raised the roadmap for reopening services with the Minister. I am glad that those guidelines have been published and we are looking at a date in August, which is welcome. However, serious issues still face those services. I welcome Mr. Dolan back to these Houses. I commend him on the work he did on disability when he was a Member of the Seanad. He referred to the 1% efficiency measure in the HSE service plan. I understand that is due to be reversed but he might highlight that and come back with a bit more information. He thinks it will be reversed but he might elaborate on that. Mr. Egan referred to the roadmap and the carer burnout. I also note from the opening statements that 75% of residential settings, where I commend the service providers, saw no outbreak at all during the height of the first phase of Covid-19.However, Mr. Egan also stated that 54% of respondents to the Inclusion Ireland survey had little or no contact from service providers. That is worrying. Many members of the committee have been contacted by affected individuals and their families. Education and day services have been shut down for those vulnerable groups. Could our guests comment on those matters?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Acting Chair. I thank the witnesses for their attendance and particularly Ms Murphy for her personal account. Like the public at large, we appreciate all that the witnesses and their members do daily, particularly during this crisis. There were a lot of challenges in advance of Covid and especially during Covid and the witnesses' submissions articulated that very well. The million-dollar question, particularly if a second wave - God forbid - were to come, is what could we do differently and how could we do it. I would be interested to hear from the various organisations here. Perhaps the representatives of the INMO would like to answer. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Ní Sheaghdha. Does any other organisation have recommendations on how we might do things differently?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	SIPTU's submission caused a bit of a flurry in advance of this meeting. It was about certain workers presenting for work with potential symptoms in fear of losing overtime or premiums. I find that worrying and I am sure members of the public would as well. How widespread was that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Obviously if there is a second wave, we need to be very conscious of that. From my perspective, the message should be that anybody who shows symptoms, irrespective of monetary gain, should not present for work. I hope Mr. King, the other witnesses and all members share that view. While financial considerations are a legitimate concern, surely health would override those. I wish Mr. King good luck in SIPTU's discussions with the HSE. On the discussions between the organisations the witnesses represent and the HSE, I presume they are ongoing in the face of a second wave. Will the witnesses elaborate on that issue?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for being here today and answering our questions. I only have five minutes and I will be brief. I hope the responses will also be accurate and brief. Deputy McAuliffe referred to the testing available to healthcare workers. I am conscious that we need to be prepared for a second wave if it comes. I refer to the supply chain for PPE, in particular the roll-out in the early stages of the first phase of the pandemic to public hospitals and private settings.What assurances can the witnesses give that sufficient stock exists and that PPE will be rolled out to the various community and public health settings?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Woods for that. It brings me to my next point, which is the potential loss of step-down and convalescent services that will be acutely needed, particularly in the winter months. These types of services are needed and it is essential that we do not lose them. We need them in order that patients can leave acute hospital settings and convalesce elsewhere. From a public health point of view, having an alternative venue for people to quarantine or have respite is desirable. What interactions does the HSE currently have in respect of securing and maintaining those services? We heard about the funded workforce plan from union representatives during our first session today. I understand that is currently being discussed. What information can our guests give us about that matter?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Does Mr. Woods mean the question I asked about convalescence?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I represent the Dún Laoghaire constituency and there are a number of such settings. Caritas Convalescent Centre, in particular, was in the newspapers last week. While it is a private setting and decisions are made independently of the HSE, it would remiss of the State not to have access to those facilities. We must ensure that no other closures will happen because we will need those settings in the next few months.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their opening remarks. I note from their opening statements that passenger numbers are almost 99% lower than 2019 levels, which is extremely worrying.As an island nation we are all acutely aware that connectivity is essential. I acknowledge this pandemic has been exceptionally difficult for the airline industry. Covid-19 will have implications well past the summer. Unfortunately, as the committee heard earlier from the DAA, job losses will be inevitable in Dublin airport in particular. It employs 21,500 people and supports 100,000 other jobs. The air transport sector is estimated to support €8.9 billion of GDP and many jobs in Ireland.  I thank the airlines, their crews and pilots for their work in the initial phase of the pandemic in securing essential medical supplies and bringing them to Ireland. That was much appreciated by the public. I hope they will pass on the committee's thanks and best wishes to the staff involved.  My first question is to Mr. Wilson from Ryanair. Does he think his airline's campaign of encouraging people to travel to countries on the green list undermines the advice being given by the Government and public health advisers in this jurisdiction about avoiding non-essential travel?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Wilson for his response but I beg to differ. According to figures from the European Centre for Disease control, some of the EU countries which Mr. Wilson says should be on the list have incidence rates that are ten times higher.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is interesting that Mr. Wilson highlighted Germany. I note that the incidence of Covid is 50% higher there than in Ireland.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It is 100,000 in Ireland, where there are 5.2 cases. I accept Mr. Wilson's bona fides as to why he wants all countries on some sort of green list and I understand the need for this. He must also understand that, from a public health and policy perspective, we must try to slow the spread of Covid. No one is suggesting that we can prevent it from coming inside our borders entirely. I accept that the airlines are under immense pressure. As I said earlier, I thank them and their pilots and crew for their work in the initial phase. That work was essential in the context of bringing PPE to Ireland. The biggest issue now is how we live with Covid. I imagine that the green list will change. I wish to ask representatives from both airlines how they perceive the airports in Ireland compared with those they are dealing with in other countries now. I ask Aer Lingus to respond first.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Returning to airline safety, my biggest concern is Ryanair's email campaign to previous customers telling them that they have the green light, which is encouraging people to travel. This flies in the face of public health advice in Ireland. Obviously, essential travel is different, but it seems that Ryanair is encouraging people who are looking at non-essential travel to do that. All members have received queries about refunds. We probably do not have time to get into that matter today. That has certainly been an issue for people who had bookings with Ryanair and who need to get those refunds.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I will ask a number of questions to which the witnesses might respond. I welcome all of them back before the committee. I had an opportunity to question them in early July when the number of cases was decreasing. That number decreased significantly afterwards as well.. My first question is on the significantly high number of cases, particularly in meat plants but also in direct provision centres, in what my colleague, Deputy Lawless, referred to as the lockdown counties versus other parts of the country. I would like to hear from the witnesses as to why they believe there is a disparity between Kildare, Laois and Offaly versus the west of Ireland. Also, I asked in June about multilingual signage and training. Has that improved in light of everything we now know about Covid-19 and the threat it causes to migrant workers, low-paid workers or indeed workers in meat plants? My next question relates to unannounced inspections, an issue I also raised previously. One of the witnesses may have mentioned earlier that there were some unannounced inspections but not many. Can they provide an indication of how many we are talking about because if they are not taking place that is a huge issue in itself? Hopefully, that will be addressed shortly. Finally, on foot of the witnesses' opening statements, there was a discussion on hot-bedding, which is shift workers sharing bedding or, indeed, housing. How prevalent is that practice?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ennis.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I have a colleague present who will probably take five minutes. I do not mind. If it is helpful we could take five each.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses very much for their attendance this morning and for their opening remarks. I also praise the work of the unions in engaging with the Department over recent months. It has been challenging for everybody involved. More importantly, I thank the principals, deputy principals, boards of management and staff. I have been in contact with many and they have been moving furniture, measuring rooms and doing all sorts of other things in advance of the reopening of schools in recent days, which is exceptionally welcome. With regard to engagement by the unions with the Department since July in respect of the reopening of schools, how much engagement over how many days has each of those present today had with the Department to date? I do not mind who goes first.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Boyle for that reply. He mentioned in his opening remarks that no new school self-evaluation would take place for 2021. Will he elaborate on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Boyle for the clarification.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses, some of whom are returning witnesses. I appreciate their opening remarks and their comments. I also thank their organisations for their work over recent months. They have worked exceptionally hard and with the various school bodies to ensure the safe reopening of our schools, which is greatly appreciated.All of us in this Chamber and elsewhere have received calls from parents who found it exceptionally difficult to manage the blended learning and some who had no access to learning in the intervening period. The witnesses' work and that of their various organisations is greatly appreciated. I have read Inclusion Ireland's survey and it is welcome. From the queries I have received to date in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, parents have either had blended learning at home and found it challenging or they have not been able to employ it. They are nervous that post Covid, things might not return to normal and I would welcome the witnesses' views on that. The witnesses might also elaborate on the home tuition scheme. Before that, I wish to ask two other questions. I commend Ms Lynch of the National Parents Council Primary on her organisation's extensive survey. Taking in 3,177 submissions over five days and bringing them here today is commendable. Equally-----
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I apologise. The sound in here is actually quite low as well, from the last session. Did Inclusion Ireland hear my last question?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Dempsey. Our time is limited and I would be happy to engage with her again on those aspects. Turning to Ms. Lynch, as I said, the National Parents Council Primary's extensive survey of 3,177 respondents over five days is to commended. From my own knowledge, in the case of some of the schools in my own constituency and our own school as well, videos and text messages were very helpful and Ms Lynch referred to this in her own remarks. This was particularly so for the junior classes, to ease them into primary school but also for those who are returning to schools with newly-implemented Covid compliance.Ms Fanning touched on the issue of mental health and well-being at post-primary level in her opening remarks. I have raised the issue of student support teams before. Will Ms Fanning comment on those, their importance and their role in the Covid environment? I thank all the witnesses very much for their attendance.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the Minister, Deputy Foley, to the committee. I thank her for all the work she has done since taking up her portfolio, together with her officials and the various stakeholders. I know it has been challenging, in particular in recent months. I hope that as we see the schools reopen in a safe environment, we will see the fruits of that work. Earlier today we had sessions with several unions – the TUI, the ASTI, the INTO and Fórsa. I praised the work of principals, deputy principals and the school staff, in particular during the month of August, in getting schools prepared and ready for reopening. The Minister mentioned the €375 million that was available for that purpose to most schools. I will come back with some questions on that but praise must be given to those staff because of the tremendous effort that has been put in by all involved in schools. Later, we heard from Inclusion Ireland and the National Parents Council Primary and the National Parents Council Post Primary about their needs and challenges. If I have time, I will put the questions to the Minister that came up in those earlier sessions. I also commend the work of the Minister and her officials on their drive and ambition in getting the schools reopened. When we last met the Minister in this committee in June, there was scepticism on whether schools would reopen in time in September and she has achieved that, so I commend her on it. That is not to say there are not challenges. We know there will be challenges going forward. The scale of the challenges facing the education sector should not be underestimated. The Minister touched on some of those in earlier contributions about the leaving certificate and, in particular, the calculated grades. Information for parents and students is essential. The information that was released some weeks ago was very welcome. Some schools, including in my constituency, did excellent information videos, targeted mainly at junior infants, those who did not get an opportunity to have their first day in the classroom with their parents. They targeted that and they did it very successfully and I commend them on that. I have a number of questions and the Minister may not have time to answer them. I think there is an issue with the sound which I hope will be addressed when the committee next meets. It seems to be between the committee room and here. If the Minister does not have time to answer all the questions she might please come back to me. Similar to the previous question about Deputies being contacted by teachers, especially with concerns about their own health and that of the students in their care, what is the process that they must undergo if they are displaying symptoms? What supports are in place for them, including the provision of substitute teachers? That is a big issue. The second question I have touches on the contributions from the unions in an earlier session today. A school had a lack of warm water. Surely the €375 million that was available could be used for that kind of thing, because a school is not Covid-ready without warm water. I ask the Minister to comment on that. I do not have the details of where the school is but that is immaterial. The Minister is aware that I have raised mental health and well-being in schools in particular at post-primary level as a real issue, especially in the face of Covid. Could the Minister elaborate on what supports are available, in particular in terms of the student support service and the National Educational Psychological Service?I ask the Minister to please answer those questions. She is very welcome before the committee.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	The Minister might come back to me directly.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their time and input this afternoon. I have a question for Dr. Buquicchio. Earlier this year, at the beginning of the pandemic, how soon did the Italian Government respond with required regulations? We looked on in shock at the high rise in numbers across Italy. How soon were the regulations brought in and have they since been extended? Dr. Buquicchio earlier stated that some of regulations have expired but have some since been extended and if so, for how long?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Lord Sumption for his time. With regard to Dr. Buquicchio's point and in terms of Lord Sumption's earlier comments on the health or hysteria analysis of where we are and how the pandemic has been treated here or in any other jurisdiction, I agree with Dr. Buquicchio's point about reviewing and analysing the response of all national governments and, indeed, the international response to this pandemic. I turn to the earlier comments about the need for primary legislation to be in place to support those guidelines, or the secondary legislation that we are governed by in the current space.I note that the UK had the Coronavirus Act 2020 and the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 among others, to which to refer. In the context of a future pandemic similar to what we are experiencing today, what would need to happen to underpin the guidelines? Is the witness suggesting a brand new Act or legislation?  We touched on Brexit earlier and I presume Lord Sumption expected that it would be mentioned on this call. In the event of a future pandemic and in the context of travel, which was mentioned earlier, what impact will Brexit have on the UK in terms of its relationship with Europe and the wider world?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to all the witnesses for their opening remarks and statements. I will turn to Ms McNally first. She made a lengthy submission to the committee in advance of today and we appreciate that. In her opening remarks, she covered proportionality and necessity arising from the emergency. It is crucial that the balance is struck, especially now as we move away from the more stringent restrictions in society and try to reopen the court services. I have several questions for Ms McNally on this. Access to the courts, including the civil and criminal courts, is crucial. I wish to hone in on the criminal aspect first. Delays have not really been experienced because of the summer months and the lifting of the restrictions I have spoken about. Will Ms McNally give the committee a flavour of the range and types of cases we are talking about and the breadth of the cases that are being held up at present? What kind of delay are we talking about? Are we talking of a delay of eight or 12 months or longer? Obviously, it will be all approximate, but I would appreciate any comments. Ms McNally specifically referenced the Central Criminal Court. There were statements about the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court. I presume the same applies in respect of the Special Criminal Court. Will Ms McNally elaborate on that matter as well? Ms McNally referred to dates and said that the Circuit Court was returning in September - at some point this month. Has the date been released?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms McNamara for her intervention. I am sure our witnesses are familiar with the proposal from a few years ago to have all of the District Court sittings moved to the Criminal Courts of Justice building. Thankfully, that did not happen to the extent to which the Courts Service wanted it to happen because we would be in a totally different situation now. Ms O'Boyle touched on the remote court hearings and the success in that regard. We are all learning in this new era. Does Ms O'Boyle believe that remote hearings will remain post-Covid?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My thanks to the witnesses for their submissions, feedback and suggestions. I realise that it has been a long afternoon and many of the questions have been asked already, so bear with me while I seek some responses from the various witnesses. My first question is to all the witnesses. I have heard numerous references to other jurisdictions and praise for the manner either in which they brought in regulations or dealt with the pandemic initially. My question is to the witnesses individually. What jurisdictions would they highlight as good examples and what are the reasons for that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Ansbro for that information. Do any other witnesses wish to comment on that point? I would like to get to several other questions as well.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I would be delighted if Ms McDonagh could forward that information.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In the earlier session we talked about a European co-operative model for the second wave, or indeed for another pandemic. If that were to happen, certainly there is learning to be had, not only by Ireland but other member states across Europe, to ensure there is a uniformity of approach. As the witness has said, there is already legislative cover there, and to be complicit with it is really important if we are to face a similar situation in the near or distant future. I refer to the particular submissions made by Ms McDonagh and Ms Gibney. In their introduction, they raised the gaps in the State's legislative framework. In particular, they highlighted legislation that is close to my own heart, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and indeed also the Mental Health Act. Could they elaborate on that? The second element to which I refer is on page 2 of the witnesses' submission, namely, the adequacy of the State's legislative framework in its response to the pandemic. Could the witnesses broaden out on those two points for me?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I referred to the point made by the witnesses in page 2 of their submission about the adequacy of the State's legislative framework and its response to the pandemic. The submission sets out a number of bullet points in that regard. I ask Ms Gibney to expand on that. Before she comes back in, I want to turn to FLAC because I am conscious of my own time. I apologise for not having more time to discuss the various submissions. I remind Ms Barry and Mr. Bowes that the impact of the restriction on court sittings was discussed in a previous session of the committee earlier today. I compliment FLAC on the very substantial submission it made to the committee. It is greatly appreciated and there is a lot of information in it for all of us to digest. I ask the witnesses to comment on the impact that delays in court sittings and trials are going to have on their own work. While the clock is in my favour, I would like to put a question to Mr. Herrick and Ms Ansbro of the ICCL. They commented in a previous submission about the response being balance-necessary, and the resources being in place. If we were to face a second wave here in Ireland, how would the witnesses suggest that the State respond differently from the way it did, given the short period we may have between now and if that were to happen? If the witnesses would not mind answering, I would greatly appreciate it. 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Barry for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Gibney.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Herrick. If the various Oireachtas committees and subcommittees are up and running, oversight and scrutiny will be there, which is important. Hopefully, there will also be a unity among the various participants of those committees. I thank the witness for his answer.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank our witnesses for their report and welcome them before the committee. The report contains 86 recommendations, 24 of which are relevant to HIQA. HIQA has meetings with the Department. I presume that is happening on an ongoing basis. How often are those meetings? I will speak in particular about Ms Dunnion's brief. There are 576 registered nursing homes in Ireland, of which 189 were inspected, if I am reading the report correctly, and there were also 2,851 phone inspections. How many inspections of all types of facilities are carried out under HIQA? Has the number of inspections increased or decreased in the light of Covid? In anticipation of a second wave, what would HIQA recommend and do differently, given that it has some time to plan this time around?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms Cliffe for that clarification on the phone interventions; I should not have said "inspections". Of the 106 to which she has referred, are they purely of nursing homes or is that in the broader remit of HIQA? Are they inspections of centres or facilities already inspected and follow-ups, as it were?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Were they follow-up inspections of previous inspections?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	This is my final question. Have the number of inspections, not just of nursing homes but overall, increased or decreased year-on-year as a result of Covid-19?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Kelleher very much for her opening statement and for the report before us. She outlined the number of nursing homes. We discussed inspections previously at the committee with Nursing Homes Ireland and others and we had HIQA in recently speaking about the number of inspections it carried out.Does she think there was an adequate number of inspections of all care settings during the initial stages of the pandemic?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witness. Regarding staffing provision, a crucial issue that came to light in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, and presumably throughout the country, which we are also seeing in schools now, is where somebody presents with symptoms, relief cover is needed. That is essential, particularly in a care setting such as a nursing home or other facility. Graph 3.3 on page 29 of the report refers to the incidence rates. A comparison is drawn between counties Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath and Longford and the lower number of cases in counties Waterford and Galway. Equally, on page 41, table 3.10, reference is made to the high incidence among healthcare workers in counties Dublin, Cavan, Louth and Monaghan in comparison to counties Waterford and Galway. What, in Dr. Kelleher's opinion, was the difference between those areas?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I turn to the discharges from hospital. The report states 10,710 individuals were discharged from nursing or convalescence homes, or long-stay accommodation and 401 had either caught or already had Covid, and 11 were probable cases. Can Dr. Kelleher elaborate on that?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Twomey for that but in terms of the number of individuals who were transferred either from a hospital setting to a nursing home or a long-stay facility, was he able to establish if they were tested prior to leaving hospital, which for me would be a critical point?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Twomey for that.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Professor Kelleher. On that point, it brings into focus chapter 5, which examined the learning from Covid to establish the extent to which nursing homes are better prepared. The witnesses might delve into the recommendations under chapter 5. The supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, at a very early stage - Professor Kelleher mentioned February and it was new to everybody at that point - took some time to filter to either public or private nursing homes. The witnesses might comment on that, too, in response to my final question.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance today. I will start with a question for Mr. Walsh regarding his opening statement. He mentioned that the HSE actions in this report will be worked on with the Department of Health and other partners to implement the recommendations that require policy change and/or policy development. For clarity, how do the Department of Health and the HSE work together and what subtle differences are there between the two bodies that require co-ordination?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In terms of the recommendations made in the report before us, whose ultimate role will it be to see its implementation? Is it the Department, the HSE or another?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	In her opening statement, Dr. MacLellan mentioned the extension to the temporary financial support scheme. Specifically, what does this cover? Does it cover staff supports and staff cover, as the previous speaker asked?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Mr. Walsh referred to the winter plan. How confident are we as a nation that we have enough PPE for the winter months? How confident are we regarding its supply and distribution and ensuring it gets to the various services speedily?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	My next question relates to our earlier session with the expert panel. There were more than 400 discharges from hospitals into congregated settings, including nursing homes, care facilities and long-stay facilities. I need assurances that anybody discharged from an acute setting will be tested. I would like confirmation on this from the relevant witness.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Reference was made to the bilateral group. Is that the same as the implementation framework group or is it separate? How many meetings of the bilateral group have taken place to date?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I refer to services for older people. When will community social day care settings resume?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome all the organisations who have appeared before the committee today and for the statements they have made. I would also particularly like to praise the staff of the respective organisations, indeed, the players and the many volunteers up and down the country who have kept things going. Even when there was not much happening, they were still willing to serve and put plans in place. Much has been said about the €70 million that was given in funding, and that consisted of €40 million for each of the three organisations, and some from other sporting bodies, such as local sports partnerships and clubs. All of the witnesses have referred to Sport Ireland's expert medical group. How often does it meet? Are all the organisations participating at the same meeting and is it a group meeting, as it were? I would like an answer to that question first, please.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Ryan for his answer.  First, I would like to offer my congratulations to the many volunteers in the GAA. I understand from Mr. Horan's opening statement that the organisation is processing approximately 91,000 health questionnaires daily, and various activities have been kept going over the last number of months. As Deputy Andrews stated, in respect of mental health, all sports, irrespective of their code, play an important role in people's lives. I acknowledge there were significant financial issues prior to Covid for the FAI, and obviously the pandemic is compounding the problem. I understand that it has applied for €19.3 million in funding. I want to ask specifically about the League of Ireland, and the impact of the pandemic there. In his opening remarks, Mr. Owens mentioned the pressures on individual clubs. My question to the FAI is this: are there plans to reduce the registration fees or other costs associated with participating in the League of Ireland for individual clubs? What measures have been put in place to try and ease the burden for the clubs that might not have the same resources as others?  In his opening remarks, Mr. Browne stated that he predicted there would be a €30 million loss for the IRFU this year. Am I correct in saying that there could be another potential €30 million loss for ticket revenue for 2020, plus further €5 million per month going forward?  I appreciate that the organisations have mentioned the importance of spectators, and the importance of spectating for the fans, irrespective of the code. Notwithstanding what happens today in Dublin, how do the witnesses see their engagement with Sport Ireland and the ability to get some spectator sport back on television, or spectators physically in the stadia or on the pitches, over the next couple of months and indeed next year?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I now invite Mr. Owens to respond to my questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	No, the League of Ireland was the main thing really, because of its importance. I now invite Mr. Browne to answer the same questions.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank all our witnesses for joining us this afternoon. I am sure they are familiar with the earlier contributions from the three large sporting organisations, namely, the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI.Some of my questions will be based on the information garnered from them. Mr. Kelly mentioned the LSPs, the very important role they play and the €7 million that was allocated to them this year. I refer to the issue of mental health and general well-being, particularly in light of the pandemic and the issues people have faced with the restrictions. In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has come up with pretty creative and imaginative ways of hosting events that are set pieces in the calendar. An example of that is the community walk, which is now going to be done over a week, and people will do that in their own smaller local parks where possible. There are also cycling and other initiatives to keep people active, which is very welcome. The funding the Department supplies is critical to these partnerships and other organisations, including sporting ones, which Mr. Treacy touched on with reference to charity events. All of these things are being done in a different way due to the circumstances that faces us. In his opening statement, Mr. Kelly referenced the sports capital programme and €19 million having been paid out so far this year. A full review of that programme in 2018 is being conducted and it is due to report shortly. When is that going to be published? Equally, the sports capital programme is going to reopen later this year. Does Mr. Kelly have a timeframe for that? As he will appreciate, many sports clubs, which may be watching this afternoon, will be very keen to know when that round of funding is opening. I read in Mr. Kelly's opening statement that due diligence and appraisals are under way as well on the LSSIF. Given the financial pressures Covid has put on clubs and organisations that may have applied for that fund, what happens if that money is not drawn down? I ask because he said that there are no plans in the short term to reopen that fund.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Sheahan. That will be reassuring for those clubs and organisations that have been granted funding but whose circumstances have also changed. In the time remaining, I might ask Mr. Treacy a question focusing on elite athletes. He mentioned Tokyo. There are other events coming down the track for many sports as well. What supports have been put in place since the initial Covid outbreak in Ireland for elite athletes? Some might not have the necessary training capabilities in their immediate environs. When the travel restrictions and so forth were lifted, what supports were put in place vis-à-vis travel and accommodation for people who had critical deadlines in their professional careers?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their time and input. I am going to ask all my questions together as I am limited on time. Dr. McConkey was asked about immunity testing and I think he was saying it may be good for about three to four months. He might elaborate on that. In the context of his recent comments on contact tracing, one of the issues we are facing is in respect of people who have tested positive trying to remember with whom they were in contact with over the relevant period. That is proving difficult. I would welcome Dr. McConkey's thoughts on that. The all-Ireland response is crucial and it is unfortunate that there are two different systems in operation on the island. It would be great to have a unified strategy. I fully agree with Dr. Schaffer's opening remarks on the two pillars. She mentioned that she delivered a paper at a Covid-19 meeting and that it ranked among the top ten papers in Europe. I would like to hear more on that, maybe after this. Dr. Ryan mentioned the best performing countries and listed a number of them. I am keen to know in comparison to Ireland what was the impact on their economies and on the movements of the populace. I compliment Dr. Giesecke on his succinct answers throughout the meeting, which help all of us who have limited time. He mentioned that a soft, voluntary lockdown may be quite effective. Could he elaborate on that? What would a soft lockdown be as opposed to a hard one? He also referred to allowing controlled spread among people below 60 while concentrating on the old and frail with frequent testing of staff and residents in care homes. Obviously, that would be ideal if it were possible but how could it be made possible? Finally, Dr. Giesecke said that Covid has surprised us many times and may again. Unfortunately, I totally agree with that. We do not know and we are in uncharted waters.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	It was in respect of the idea of a soft lockdown and what that would entail..
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	That is fine. I thank the witnesses.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Mr. Reid and the other witnesses for their attendance. I welcome the community first approach in the winter plan that was announced recently.In terms of the winter plan, what reassurances can the witnesses give the committee and the public of the continuation of care, surgery and outpatient services during the winter months if there is a further spike in Covid cases?  My next question relates to my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. Given the number of elderly people who live in the community, I ask Ms O'Connor to elaborate on what Mr. Reid referred to in his opening remarks as "home support and enhanced home support packages". 
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	Yes.
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank Ms O'Connor. Mr. Reid mentioned a flu vaccine for two to 12-year olds. I ask him to elaborate on that as it is of interest in particular to parents and school-going children. Wonderful work has been done by Mr. Reid's staff and other staff as well on testing and tracing but several people in my constituency have reported that they have been dispatched to test centres in Wicklow, Tallaght or St. Vincent's Hospital as their local testing centres. I concur with other members that that is just not feasible for some people. Why is a testing centre not more readily available in the southeastern area of Dublin? Finally, it will be mental health week shortly. Given the impact that Covid is having on people who experience issues with their mental health, what additional services have been put in place as part of the winter plan?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I thank the Chair and welcome the Minister, as well as Dr. Glynn, Dr. De Gascun and Professor Nolan, here today. My first question is to the Minister. The HSE appeared before the committee yesterday, and Mr. Paul Reid stated that the HSE was recruiting up to 3,5000 new staff to increase its test and trace capacity. Will this be sufficient to meet demand in the coming months?
CormacDevlin	Deputy Cormac Devlin	2020-02-08	None	I welcome Dr. Glynn and thank him for taking the time to appear before the committee. As all the witnesses appearing today are extremely busy, the committee appreciates their return before it. I have a question on the return of children to school and the impact it has had on infection rates. While there has been an increase in testing activity both for pupils and teachers, what is the comparative percentage of positive tests for those aged between four and 14 years of age for August and for September?
