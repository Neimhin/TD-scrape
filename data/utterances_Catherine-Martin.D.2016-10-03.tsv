CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis an gcomhchoiste as cuireadh a thabhairt dom freastail ar an gcruinniú seo. Tá an-áthas orm labhairt le cruinniú Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge faoi chraoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge. Mar is eol don choiste, tá an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, freagrach as an nGaeltacht agus pobal labhartha na Gaeilge go ginearálta. Labhair sé leis an gcomhchoiste seo go minic faoi réimse leathan ábhair a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge. Díreoidh mise ar cheisteanna a bhaineann le craoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge inniu. Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl ar dtús go bhfuil an Ghaeilge an-tábhachtach dom go pearsanta agus i mo ról mar Aire freagrach as na meáin. Tacaíonn an chraoltóireacht lenár bhféiniúlacht mar náisiún, leis na healaíona, leis an gcultúr, leis an spórt agus, ar ndóigh, le teanga na Gaeilge. Trí mheán na craoltóireachta, bíonn comhráite againn mar náisiún agus déanaimid teagmháil le hÉireannaigh atá lonnaithe thar sáile. Bhunaigh an Taoiseach agus mé féin Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán chun aitheantas a thabhairt do thábhacht na meán. Leagamar síos téarma tagartha a aithníonn an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge sa chraoltóireacht. Tá an Ghaeilge mar chuid lárnach de mhisean mheán seirbhíse poiblí chun muintir na hÉireann a choinneáil ar an eolas, oideachas a chur uirthi agus siamsaíocht a chur ar fáil di. Sa chomhairliúchán poiblí, fuair an coimisiún níos mó ná 800 freagra aighneachta le COMHAR, Tuairisc, Raidió Rí-Rá agus Gael Linn san áireamh. Ina theannta sin, ghlac TG4, RTÉ, Craol agus Conradh na Gaeilge páirt i gcomhráite leis an gcoimisiún agus le ball den phobal. Cuireadh an coimisiún ar an eolas mar sin faoi na dúshláin atá roimh chraoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge agus na deiseanna atá ar fáil di. Tá an tuarascáil le cur faoi mo bhráid i mí Iúil agus tá mé ag súil leis na moltaí a bheith inti maidir leis an nGaeilge. Molaim an obair iontach atá déanta ag TG4 chun craoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge a thabhairt chun cinn. Tá a réimse leathan cláir, a chur chuige Súil Eile agus an úsáid a bhaineann sé as teicneolaíocht ina gceannródaíocht thar cionn. Freastalaíonn sé ar an bpobal ar fad agus cuireann sé anam sa náisiún.Bhí an-áthas orm mar sin maoiniú breise €1.9 milliún a fhógairt do TG4 i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 2020. Tugadh an maoiniú seo chun aitheantas a thabhairt don obair iontach atá déanta ag TG4 chun dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin a chuir Covid-19 roimhe le linn 2020. Ina theannta sin, cuirfidh mé maoiniú €3.5 milliún ar fáil do TG4 in 2021, ag ardú a buiséad bliantúil go €1 milliún níos mó ná an méid a mhol Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann ina athbhreithniú cúig bliana. Ar an iomlán, gheobhaidh TG4 €40.7 milliún in 2021. Is mise an chéad Aire chun ciste craoltóireachta na Gaeilge, a reáchtálann Fís Thuaisceart Éireann, a thabhairt chun cinn. Táim an-bhródúil as sin. Cuirfidh mo Roinnse €1 milliún ar fáil gach bliain idir 2021 agus 2023 chun ábhar Gaeilge a chruthú i dTuaisceart Éireann. Ina theannta sin, tugadh €100,000 do RTÉ agus TG4 chun a n-ábhar a chur chun cinn i dTuaisceart Éireann. Tacóidh an maoiniú seo leis an earnáil léiriúcháin neamhspleách ar fud an oileáin. Cuirfidh sé ábhar Gaeilge ar ardchaighdeán ar fáil do chraoltóirí. Tá ról lárnach ag RTÉ i gcraoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tugann an tAcht Craolacháin ar an gcraoltóir náisiúnta réimse cuimsitheach clár a chur ar fáil as Gaeilge agus as Béarla araon, a léiríonn éagsúlacht chultúrtha oileán na hÉireann ina iomláine. Gach bliain, déanann Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann athbhreithniú ar ráiteas bliantúil na ngealltanas léirithe a leagann RTÉ síos, gealltanais i dtaca leis an nGaeilge san áireamh. Mar fhreagra ar thuarascáil an Choimisinéara Teanga in 2018, d’fhorbair RTÉ plean gnímh. Bhí sé mar aidhm ag an bplean seo líon na gclár Ghaeilge ar RTÉ a mhéadú go suntasach agus réimse clár a chinntiú. B’fhéidir gur mhaith leis an gcoiste teagmháil dhíreach a dhéanamh le RTÉ maidir le hábhar an phlean gnímh sin. Tuigim gur tháinig méadú suntasach ar chruthú cláir Ghaeilge agus uaireanta craoltóireachta trí mheán na Gaeilge in 2020. Tá ról tábhachtach ag an raidió i sochaí na hÉireann. Léiríonn suirbhéanna ón gcomhthaighde náisiúnta ar lucht éisteachta go n-éisteann níos mó ná ceathrar as cúigear duine fásta in Éirinn leis an raidió gach lá. Le ráta muiníne 7.9 as deich, bhraith an Rialtas ar an raidió chun an pobal a choinneáil ar an eolas faoi chúrsaí le linn ghéarchéim Covid-19. Aontaím leis an Uachtarán Ó hUiginn go bhfuil tábhacht as cuimse ag Raidió na Gaeltachta do phobail na Gaeltachta, maidir leis an nGaeilge a neartú agus pobail a thacú sna ceantair sin. Fuair an stáisiún maoiniú €11.4 milliún in 2020. Ag obair in éineacht lenár gcraoltóir náisiúnta, cuireann trí stáisiún raidió eile craoltóireacht lán-Ghaeilge ar fáil do lucht éisteachta Gaeilge i bpobail áitiúla. Tá Raidió na Life ag freastal ar mhórcheantar Baile Átha Cliath ó 1993 i leith agus craolann Raidió Fáilte i mBéal Feirste. Faigheann an dá stáisiún seo €240,000 gach bliain. Freastalaíonn Raidió Rí-Rá ar riachtanais éisteoirí óga agus fuair sé níos mó ná €475,000 ón Roinn ó thosaigh sé ag craoladh in 2009. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt d’obair Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann ar phlean gnímh Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus coiste comhairleach a bhunú. Rinne sé an obair seo i gcomhairle le Foras na Gaeilge chun tionscnaimh craoltóireachta trí mheán na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn. Cuirim fáilte ar leith roimh an mbéim a chur an coiste ar an bhféidearthacht chun seirbhís Ghaeilge raidió óga a chur ar bhun, cosúil le seirbhís hibrideach dhigiteach FM. Tugadh tosaíocht do chraoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge sa scéim fuaime agus físe. Le híosmhéid 25% sa mhaoiniú tiomanta do thionscadail Ghaeilge, leithdháileadh €3.1 milliún, mar shampla, i scéim fuaime agus físe trí Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann i leith léiriú 56 tionscadal as Gaeilge nó go dátheangach in 2019. Labhraím leis an gcoiste seo le linn tréimhse ina bhfuil athruithe móra ag tarlú. Bunófar coimisiún na meán faoin mBille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne. Glacfaidh an coimisiún nua le feidhmeanna agus foireann Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann, feidhmeanna a bhaineann le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge san áireamh. Cuirfidh bunú rialtóra nua, mar aon leis an tuarascáil atá ag teacht ón gCoimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán, ar ár gcumas dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin atá romhainn, roimh an nGaeilge agus roimh sheirbhísí closamhairc san áireamh. Mar a luaigh mé níos luaithe, táim ag súil le moltaí an Choimisiúin um Thodhchaí na Meán a léamh maidir le craoltóireacht agus meán eile trí mheán na Gaeilge nuair a chuirfear an tuarascáil faoi mo bhráid i mí Iúil. Leagfaidh sí síos treo an pholasaí do na deich mbliana atá romhainn. Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom glacadh leis an deis seo chun buíochas a ghabháil le Michael O’Keeffe, a bheidh ag dul ar scor go luath, as Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann a stiúradh agus as na 30 bliain a d’oibrigh sé i saol rialacháin na meán. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste arís as cuireadh a thabhairt dom agus athdhearbhaím arís mo thiomantas do chraoltóireacht trí mheán na Gaeilge. Táim ag súil le ceisteanna na mball a fhreagairt.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas ar dtús leis an Teachta Calleary as a chuid ceisteanna. Maidir le TG4 agus a maoiniú, bhí áthas orm maoiniú forlíontach €1.9 milliún a chur ar fáil sa bhliain 2020 a bhain leis na costais bhreise maidir leis na cláir i dtaca le Covid-19, go háirithe "Cúla4 ar Scoil". Méadaíonn an maoiniú breise €3.5 milliún a fuair mé don bhliain 2021 an leithdháileadh iomlán i mbliana go dtí €40.7 milliún, a sháraíonn an maoiniú a mhol an BAI le méid de €6 milliún thar an leibhéal maoinithe don bhliain 2017. Cinnteoidh sé seo gur féidir le TG4 leanúint le clár-sceidealú nuálach Gaeilge ar ardchaighdeán a sholáthar agus a straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm níos fearr chun lucht féachana níos óige a mhealladh agus a choinneáil ar gach ardán. Maidir le Raidió na Gaeltachta, beidh an stáisiún seo mar raidió náisiúnta na Gaeilge 50 bliain ar an bhfód an bhliain seo chugainn agus déanfar ceiliúradh air seo ansin. Mar a dúirt an tUachtarán Ó hUiginn ag ceiliúradh 40 bliain a luaigh mé cheana agus aontaím leis, tá tábhacht as cuimse ag an stáisiún do phobal na Gaeltachta maidir leis an nGaeilge a neartú agus pobail a thacú sna ceantair sin. Tá Raidió na Gaeltachta ar cheann den cheithre stáisiún a chraolann go hiomlán trí mheán na Gaeilge anois agus fuair sé maoiniú €11.4 milliún dó in 2020. Tugann Foras na Gaeilge tacaíocht dó tríd an scéim raidió pobail. Tá sé mar aidhm ag an scéim seo sceideal craoltóireachta lán-Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do phobail áitiúla le Gaeilge. Faigheann Raidió na Life i mBaile Átha Cliath agus Raidió Fáilte i mBéal Feirste €240,000 gach bliain. Freastalaíonn Raidió Rí-Rá ar dhéimeagrafaic níos óige agus fuair sí níos mó ná €475,000 ón Roinn ó thosaigh an stáisiún ag craoladh in 2009. Maidir le Raidió Rí-Rá, tuigim an gá atá ann le hiolrachas i gcraoltóireacht na Gaeilge agus an gá héisteoirí níos óige a mhealladh chun craoltóireacht na Gaeilge. Tá sárjab déanta ag Raidió Rí-Rá chun daoine óga a mhealladh trína aipeanna agus a phodchraoltaí. Tuigim gur craoladh é ar FM freisin ar feadh tréimhsí gearra i roinnt áiteanna sa tír. Tá foireann láidir d’oibrithe deonacha ag an stáisiún mar aon leis an oiliúint a chuireann an stáisiún ar fáil do dhaoine óga, go háirithe mic léinn idirbhliana agus tríú leibhéil, atá thar barr ar fad. Is eol dom go bhfuil aighneacht mhionsonraithe curtha faoi bhráid an Choimisiúin um Thodhchaí na Meán ag Raidió Rí-Rá ag tacú le hiarratas ar cheadúnas FM a bheith aige ar fud na tíre agus ar feadh na bliana. Chuir Raidió na Life aighneacht faoi bhráid an Choimisiúin um Thodhchaí na Meán freisin ag leagan amach uaillmhian an stáisiúin a chraoladh FM a leathnú níos faide i gcéin ná Baile Átha Cliath amháin chun an dara seirbhís chraoltóireachta Ghaeilge ar fud na tíre a sholáthar. Táim ag tnúth le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar mholtaí an Choimisiúin um Thodhchaí na Meán ar an ábhar seo im mí Iúil. Idir an dá linn tugaim faoi deara go bhfuil coiste comhairleach na Gaeilge de chuid Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann ag déanamh scrúdú ar an ábhar agus iniúchadh ar réiteach eatramhach a fháil agus fágfaidh mé ag an Uasal O’Keefe tuilleadh sonraí a thabhairt air sin. Maidir le ceist an tSeanadóra Ward, braitheann na hoibleagáidí ar na hoibritheoirí tráchtála ar nádúr a gceadúnas ó Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann agus iarrfaidh mé ar an Uasal O’Keefe an cheist seo a fhreagairt. Maidir leis an tobhach nó an levy, forálann na moltaí a reáchtáladh i dtaobh an Rialtais inné go dtabharfar díolúine do stáisiúin ar nós Raidió na Life an tobhach craoltóireacht a íoc. Thug mé moltaí chuig an Rialtas le déanaí chun forálacha an Bhille Craolacháin (Leasú) a chomhaontú sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne. Cuimsítear leis seo foráil a dhíolmhóidh gach craoltóir pobail, lena n-áitrítear stáisiúin phobail Gaeilge, ó aon tobhach a íoc sa todhchaí. Beidh sé seo amhlaidh beag beann ar aon ioncam a bheidh ag stáisiúin dá leithéid ó fhoinsí poiblí nó ó fhoinsí eile. Foilseofar an reachtaíocht faoin samhradh. Maidir leis an Teachta Ó Cathasaigh, d’fhreagair mé a cheist faoi Raidió Rí-Rá nuair a d’fhreagair mé na ceisteanna ón Teachta Calleary. Maidir lena cheist ar an nGaeilge sa Tuaisceart, fáiltím roimh ath-thionól an chomhaontaithe roinnte cumhachta sa Tuaisceart. Mar chuid de thiomantas Rialtas na hÉireann don chomhaontú, tá lúcháir orm €1 milliún a fháil i mbliana, le tiomantas den chineál céanna don dá bhliain atá romhainn chun tacú le craoltóireacht na Gaeilge i dTuaisceart Éireann. Tá ríméad orm go mbeidh ar a laghad 75 uair ag plé ábhar Gaeilge breise mar thoradh ar an maoiniú breise, agus ina theannta sin, tá €100,000 in aghaidh na bliana daingnithe agam i mbliana don dá bhliain atá romhainn do TG4 agus do RTÉ chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i dTuaisceart Éireann. Ar cheist an Teachta Ó Cathasaigh maidir leis an gCoimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán, foráiltear leis an gclár Rialtais go mbunófar an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán chun todhchaí na meán clóite, craolta agus ar líne a mheas. Tá sé de chúram air moltaí a dhéanamh don Taoiseach agus dom féin chun a chinntiú: gur féidir le maoiniú craolacháin seirbhíse phoiblí a bheith inbhuanaithe; go dtabharfar slándáil mhaoinithe; go dtabharfar maoirseacht ar eagarthóireacht neamhspleách; agus go dtabharfar luach ar airgead don phobal. Is é an tOllamh Brian MacCraith cathaoirleach an choimisiúin agus tá a chuid teagmhála déanta ag an gcoimisiún leis na príomhpháirtithe leasmhara, lena n-áirítear iad siúd a thacaíonn leis an nGaeilge. Reáchtáil an coimisiún comhairliúchán poiblí níos luaithe i mbliana agus bhí áthas orm go ndearnadh 15 aighneacht, trácht, agus mholadh ar leith maidir le craoltóireacht na Gaeilge. Ba iad Comhar, Gael Linn, Raidió Rí-Rá, Scáileán Thuaisceart Éireann, Fís Éireann, The Irish News, Craol, Conradh na Gaeilge, Ceardchumann Náisiúnta na nIriseoirí, Raidió na Life, Raidió na Gaeltachta, Sinn Féin, RTÉ agus Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann a rinne na haighneachtaí. Tugaim faoi deara go ndearnadh ionadaíochta ar an nGaeilge le linn na sraithe idirphlé téamaí a d’eagraigh an coimisiún, le cur i láthair ó Julian de Spáinn, ardrúnaí Chonradh na Gaeilge agus Alan Esslemont, ardstiúrthóir TG4. Táim ag tnúth le tuarascáil an choimisiúin nuair a bheidh a chuid oibre tagtha chun críche, a chuirfidh buneolas ar fáil faoi bhearta na meán, na meáin chlóite san áireamh, sna deich mbliana atá romhainn agus táim ag súil go n-éileofar athrú reachtaíochta ar an Acht Craolacháin 2009 i roinnt cásanna mar thoradh ar thuarascáil an choimisiúin i mí Iúil.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ar dtús tagraím do na pointí a d'ardaigh an Teachta McHugh. Táim go mór i bhfách leis an gheilleagar agus aithním an tábhacht a bhaineann le freastal ar riachtanais chainteoirí Gaeilge agus ar riachtanais na ndaoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge láidir acu. Tá tábhacht ar leith bainteach leis an choincheap grá don teanga a chruthú i measc an aosa óg. Sin an fáth gur chuir mé maoiniú breise ar fáil do TG4 i mbliana agus gur chuir an Rialtas an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán ar bun chun maoiniú inbhuanaithe na meán a thacú. Táim ag súil go mór, mar a dúirt mé cheana, le moladh an choimisiúin maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge. Anuas air sin, cuirfear béim ar leith sa choiste nua a bheidh le bunú faoin Bhille um rialáil sabháilteachta meán agus meán ar líne ar riachtanais dhaoine óga. Chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i measc na ndaoine óga, tá an Roinn ag tacú le tograí éagsúla ar líne ar nós Trasna na dTonnta, Cruinniú na nÓg, Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta agus iliomad gníomhaíochtaí lena n-oifigigh pleanála teanga. Tá an oiread rud ar bun i saol na Gaeilge le linn na paindéime. Baineann go leor leis na scéimeanna agus na himeachtaí ar líne atá á maoiniú ag mo Roinn agus ag Foras na Gaeilge, agus tá imeachtaí beo bríomhaire ar bun ar líne san áireamh anseo ar nós "Cúla4 ar Scoil", campaí samhradh ar líne, ciorcail chomhrá ar líne agus scéim oiliúna peile ar líne sa Ghaeltacht. Ní mar a chéile iad ach tá moladh mór ag dul go dtí na grúpaí atá á ndéanamh. Tagraím do na pointí a d'ardaigh an Teachta Connolly. Tugaim faoi deara an tagairt dearfach atá ag RTÉ leis an Choimisinéir Teanga agus a thiomantas a aithint chun soláthar ábhair Ghaeilge a mhéadú thar a ceithre stáisiúin féin agus an tiomantas ábhair mhéadaithe a sholáthar ar ardáin mhalartacha amhail an seinnteoir agus seirbhísí podchraoladh RTÉ. Fáiltím roimh an chomhthionscnamh nua, ar scáth a chéile, idir RTÉ agus TG4 a thabharfaidh an clúdach is leithne agus is féidir d'ábhair Ghaeilge ar ardchaighdeán, beag beann ar cén craoltóir seirbhísí poiblí a fuair an t-ábhar. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil sé ar intinn ag RTÉ, ag teacht lena tiomantas 365 uair an chloig de chláracha Gaeilge a chur ar fáil do TG4, an t-easnamh in uaireanta na bliana 2020 a sheachaint, easnamh a tharla mar gheall ar na deiseanna laghdaithe i dtaca le léiriúcháin ábhair a bhí ann de bharr Covid-19. Déanann an BAI monatóireacht ar chraoltóireacht na Gaeilge cheana agus déanann an Coimisinéir Teanga monatóireacht ar chomhlíonadh an Achta Craolacháin 2009 freisin. Go deimhin, chonaiceamar an feabhas a rinne RTÉ ar chláracha Gaeilge a sholáthar tar éis tuarascáil an Choimisinéara Teanga in 2018. Mar chuid de phlean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge an BAI, chuir sé tús le tuarascáil bliantúil a bhaileoidh sonraí i leith na Gaeilge agus chuir an chéad tuarascáil i mí Feabhra marc tagartha ar fáil maidir le cé chomh maith is a bhí craoltóirí ag cloí lena ngealltanais maidir le cláracha Gaeilge, agus déanfar é seo a rianú le himeacht ama. Is céim thábhachtach chun tosaigh í seo agus b'fhéidir gur mhaith le Michael O'Keeffe ón BAI níos mó a rá faoi seo. Mar gheall ar an Acht Craolacháin 2009, beidh an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán ag cur tuarascáil ar fáil go luath agus ansin beidh seans agam an Achta a threisiú. Aontaím gur ceart don Stát leanúint le craoltóireacht na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn gach bealach is féidir agus d'ardaigh Conradh na Gaeilge an cheist seo liom. Mar is eol do na Teachtaí, rinneadh plé ar an cheist seo ar Chéim an Choiste de Bhille na Teangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú) 2019, a cuireadh i gcrích le déanaí. Gheall mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, machnamh a dhéanamh ar leasuithe a thabhairt ar ailt d'Acht na dTeangach Oifigiúla 2003 trí fhoráil a chur isteach ar Chéim na Tuarascála chun a chinntiú go ndéanfaidh forais phoiblí 20% dá gcuid fógraíochtaí trí mheán na Gaeilge le linn bliana ar bith. Chomh maith leis sin, chun a chinntiú go gcraoltar 5% den fhógraíocht sin le linn bliana ar bith sa mheán Gaeilge agus má achtaítear an fhoráil sin, d'fhéadfadh sé sruthanna ioncama breise a chruthú do TG4, tionscnamh a chuirimis go léir fáilte roimhe. Níl an fógraíocht maidir le Covid faoi chúram mo Roinne ach, mar Aire, tá sé seo ríthábhachtach domsa. Tá sé ríthábhachtach go mbeadh an fógraíocht Gaeilge ar fáil ag an am céanna leis an mBéarla agus tá mé tiomanta mar Aire go dtarlóidh sin. Seo ceist atá ardaithe agamsa arís agus arís. D'iarr mé ar mo chuid oifigigh an scéal a fhiosrú freisin. D'ardaigh an Teachta Moynihan Raidió na Gaeltachta. Cé go ndéanann RTÉ a fheidhmeanna a fheidhmiú go neamhspleách, fáiltím roimh an athbhreithniú ar struchtúir grádaithe atá le teacht ó RTÉ lena n-airítear grád clár reachtaire faoi dheireadh na bliana seo. É sin ráite, creidim go láidir i bprionsabal an chomhionannais i ngach gné den saol, mar atá á léiriú sna ceapacháin atá déanta agam do bhoird Stáit atá faoi chúram na Roinne ó a ceapadh mé mar Aire. Níor mhaith liom a cheapadh go bhfuil fostaithe de chuid aon eagraíocht Stát nó neamhstát atá i mbun na hoibre céanna ar scálaí pá difriúla. Cuireann foireann RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta seirbhís craolacháin den scoth ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta, ach go háirithe do phobal labhartha na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht chomh maith. Mar a dúirt mé, fáiltím roimh an athbhreithniú ar struchtúir grádaithe atá le teacht ó RTÉ. Is é mo thuairim pearsanta go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh Gaeilge agus Béarla ar chomhchéim agus go léireofaí an meas céanna don dá teanga. Tuigeann RTÉ go bhfuil dualgas aige faoin reachtaíocht i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Tuigim go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh RTÉ ag teacht os comhair na coiste go luath agus is féidir le comhaltaí an cheist a ardú le RTÉ ansin. Thug mé freagra mar gheall ar an fhógraíochta agus ar an fhógraíocht Covid-19 don Teachta Connolly agus d'ardaigh an Teachta Moynihan na pointí céanna.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Maidir le fógraíocht, aontaím leis an Teachta Daly gur ceart don Stát leanúint leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn i ngach bealach is féidir, mar a dúirt mé cheana. D'ardaigh Conradh na Gaeilge an cheist chéanna liom. Mar is eol do na Teachtaí anseo, rinneadh plé le déanaí ar an gceist ag Céim an Choiste de Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú) 2019. Gheall an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, go ndéanfaidh sé machnamh ar leasú a dhéanamh ar alt 9 d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 trí fhoráil a chur isteach ar Chéim na Tuarascála chun a chinntiú go ndéanfaidh forais phoiblí 20% dá gcuid fógraíochta trí mheán na Gaeilge le linn bliana ar bith. Chomh maith leis sin, cinnteofar go gcraolfar 5% den fhógraíocht sin ar na meáin Ghaeilge le linn bliana ar bith. Má achtaítear an fhoráil seo, d'fhéadfaí sruthanna ioncaim bhreise a chruthú do TG4 ó fhógraíocht ón earnáil phoiblí, tionscnamh a gcuirfimis go léir fáilte roimhe. Maidir le Raidió na Gaeltachta a bheith neamhspleách, b'fhéidir go bhfanfaidh mé go dtí go bhfaighim an tuarascáil ón gcoimisiún i mí Iúil. B'fhéidir go mbeidh Michael O'Keeffe in ann freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist sin. B'fhéidir go mbeadh freagra ag RTÉ freisin nuair a thiocfaidh a ionadaithe os comhair an choiste. Chuir an Seanadóir Clifford-Lee ceist faoi Raidió Rí-Rá. Dúirt mé i m'óráid go bhfuil sárobair déanta ag Raidió Rí-Rá ag mealladh daoine óga tríd a aip d'fhóin chliste agus a phodchraoltaí. Mar Aire, is maith liom a chloisteáil ón BAI go bhfuil sé ag tacú i bprionsabal le stáisiún raidió do dhaoine óga agus go bhfuiltear ag súil le dul chun cinn maidir leis an gceist seo roimh dheireadh na bliana. Is ceist thábhachtach é. D'ardaigh an Teachta Ó Cuív a lán ceisteanna tábhachtacha. Táim ag déileáil leis na ceisteanna seo tríd an gCoimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán. Foráiltear sa chlár Rialtais go mbunófar an coimisiún seo chun todhchaí na meán clóite, craolta agus ar líne a mheas. Reáchtáil an coimisiún comhairliúchán poiblí níos luaithe i mbliana. Bhí áthas orm go ndearnadh 15 aighneacht ina raibh tráchtaireacht agus moltaí ar leith maidir le craoltóireacht na Gaeilge. Tháinig iad sin ó Raidió Rí-Rá, Gael Linn, Comhar, Scáileán Thuaisceart Éireann, Fís Éireann, Conradh na Gaeilge, Ceardchumann Náisiúnta na nIriseoirí, Raidió na Life, Raidió na Gaeltachta, Sinn Féin, RTÉ agus an BAI. Tugaim faoi deara go ndearnadh ionadaíocht ar an nGaeilge le linn na sraithe idirphlé ar théamaí a d'eagraigh an coimisiún, ina raibh cur i láthair ó Julian de Spáinn, ardrúnaí Chonradh na Gaeilge, agus Alan Esslemont, ardstiúrthóir TG4, le cloisteáil. Táim ag tnúth leis an tuairisc sin. Tá sé ag teacht agus, le cúnamh Dé, beidh sé agam i mí Iúil. Sílim go ndéanfar déileáil lena lán de na ceisteanna atá ag an Teachta sa tuairisc sin. Maidir le TG4, bhí áthas orm maoiniú forlíontach de €1.9 milliún a chur ar fáil do TG4 sa bhliain 2020 i gcomhair na gcostas breise a bhain le cláir a bhain le Covid-19 a chur ar fáil, go háirithe "Cúla4 ar Scoil". Leis an maoiniú breise de €3.5 milliún a fuair mé don bhliain 2020, ba é an leithdháileadh iomlán i mbliana €40.7 milliún, figiúr a sháraíonn an maoiniú a mhol an BAI, is é sin, €6 milliún thar an leibhéal maoinithe don bhliain 2016. Maidir le cé a dhéanann an cinneadh gur ceart nó nach ceart go mbeadh maoiniú TG4 mar an gcéanna le maoiniú S4C, tá freagracht reachtúil ar Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann riachtanais mhaoinithe TG4 a mholadh. Rinne mé beart de réir mo bhriathar i dtaca leis sin. Déanfaidh mé mo mhachnamh ar aon mholtaí breise a dhéanann an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán. Ó thaobh scálaí pá i Raidió na Gaeltachta de, táim ar an eolas faoin gceist thábhachtach seo. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, cé go ndéanann RTÉ a fheidhmeanna a fheidhmiú go neamhspleách, fáiltím roimh an athbhreithniú ar struchtúir ghráid atá le teacht ó RTÉ. Dúirt mé níos luaithe go bhfuilim den tuairim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla ar chomhchéim agus go léireofaí an meas céanna don dá theanga.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that a criminal offence?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Are defendants required to pay the costs as well?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a cost attached to going to court.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Could we get an idea of the cost of prosecuting one of those cases?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There was at least a perception of encouragement to have social welfare and pension payments and so on made through the banks which had the consequence of undermining the post office system. The perception - I will put it no stronger than that - was that it was really intended to improve the health of the banking system by having additional activity, but there was a consequence for post offices. It undermined something that could be an organic third force in banking, or at least part of one. There are other issues. As well as the winning of a contract, there is the potential undermining of another State entity by the policy followed by the likes of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in pretty much directing that people be paid by direct debit or standing order, rather than collecting their payments at a post office. That is the other side, of which we should not lose sight.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It follows on from other information we have received on how Ireland compares with other countries. We would be complaining if procurement law was not being followed properly. There is a conundrum in that when we compare Ireland to other European countries, we see that the leakage here is much higher. That might be because of our size, but we do not have an answer to that question. This does not concern jobs in this area only but in other areas also. The Chairman is right; the library service is a very obvious example.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My intention was to flag No. 1598.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Toisc gurb í seo an chéad uair dom labhairt sa Dáil, ba mhaith liom i dtús báire mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le muintir Bhaile Átha Cliath - Ráth an Dúin as an onóir seo a thabhairt dom agus as a gcuid muiníne iomláin a léiriú chun ionadaíocht a dheánamh ar a son sa Dara Dáil is Tríocha. As this is my first time to speak in this House, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Dublin Rathdown for giving me the privilege and honour of representing them in the Thirty-second Dáil. Like many newly elected Deputies, I am relishing the opportunity to do my utmost to fulfil my mandate by doing my best to deliver on the many pressing and real issues that affect people's daily lives. This shameful delay of 47 days, and counting, is obstructing and impeding us from doing the urgent work we were elected to do. This delay and level of obstructionism would put in the ha'penny place the obstructionist tactics deployed in a different time by the Irish Parliamentary Party MP, Joseph Biggar, in the House of Commons in the late 19th century. The obstruction then was due to excessive talking, whereas the obstruction now is due to a refusal to talk or seek solutions. The stance adopted by political parties in refusing to consider forming the most stable Government to serve the people has been disingenuously represented by certain people as somehow linked to the national interest.How can the current strangulation of representative democracy, a choking of the workings of Dáil Éireann, be in the national interest? This reckless approach cares little for the tackling of the unprecedented crisis of homelessness, the escalating rent crisis, hospital waiting lists and climate justice. Lest any party has forgotten, it is important to remind them of the obvious, namely, no one party won the general election. Unfortunately, it seems the people have lost. Some political parties refuse to face up to and accept this new political reality. They refuse to accept the change for which the people voted in February. In the words of George Bernard Shaw, "Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything". It is all too easy to make noise, instil division, create dissent, divide and score points. The contrived party policy differences and the point blank refusal of some to consider even talking to others who also have a democratic mandate is unacceptable. Enough is enough. The only losers in this charade are the people. It behoves political parties to act in the best interests of the people of Ireland, not themselves or their parties. While some members have worked hard and displayed some political courage, others have not, choosing instead to sit on their hands for the past seven weeks. Deputies are not elected to be silent or to run for the hills to take cover when the going gets tough. Now is the time when Members should step up and speak up for the people who elected them. Put people before party politics.  Government formation should not be hijacked by self-serving party political concerns. The people are sovereign and have spoken. Given the current fragility of the Irish economic recovery, I implore elected Members to lead and to not be led by a cohort of party political membership, whose only concern in terms of stability appears to be concern for party political stability, party consolidation or party growth. This abysmal lack of leadership might yet require the President, in what would be an unprecedented step, to consider exercising his absolute discretion to steer a way forward for the Thirty-second Dáil. It is never too late to take the best course of action for Ireland. The most stable and compatible option is, of course, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, or is that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael? It might come as news to people in their party cocoons but the vast majority of people do not care in which order those party names are used but they do passionately care about their families and their country's future. Is féidir linn fís nua a léiriú do mhuintir na tíre má táimid sásta comhoibriú le chéile agus bealach ceannródaíoch a thógáil don todhchaí. Seo í uair na cinniúna. Seo í an uair le haghaidh crógacht agus ceannaireacht. Now is the time to show real leadership. Stop hiding behind what parties claim is in the national interest when clearly it is not. It is time to do what is in the national interest. It is way past time to put the country first and form a stable Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ireland's mental health policy, A Vision for Change, was launched in 2006. This document was heralded as innovative, exciting, progressive and inspirational. By positioning the service user at the heart of his or her own recovery journey, it promised a new and modern approach for citizens with mental health difficulties. It offered pathways through which our mental health services could be brought into line with best practice models from around the world. A Vision for Change shifted the emphasis from institutionalism to community integration. It promised to offer the most vulnerable citizen a critical ingredient of recovery - hope. He or she could recover his or her good health and live his or her life to the fullest. Our citizens would enjoy equal access to good quality services wherever they lived. The service user would be offered a menu of interventions and supports within his or her community and be truly integrated into that community. He or she could strive towards living a meaningful life and achieve a true sense of belonging at home, as a member of the local community rather than being in a hospital. Multidisciplinary teams delivering supports to individuals within their community would help destigmatise mental illness. Service users would be met at whatever stage they were on their personal journey towards wellness. Embracing the recovery ethos, we looked forward to the modernisation of our mental health services and an increase in accountability, transparency and governance. However, in truth, ten years on from its inception this policy's implementation has been at a snail's pace. It is easy to be cynical. It can be said that it has been a case of more vision than change. This is not a criticism of the authors of this excellent document or the under-resourced health professionals of our depleted health services, but the truth is that citizens with mental health difficulties and their families have been let down. The light of hope signalled in 2006 has almost completely been extinguished.  We in this House must be advocates for the most vulnerable. We must be relentless in our pursuit of their rights - to ensure that even within times of financial constraints and pressures, our priorities are not blinded. The most vulnerable often cannot be an effective voice for themselves, but this should not mean than we ignore them and prioritise other areas for spending. We need to revisit the A Vision for Change document and prioritise its full implementation. We need to restore hope. We certainly do not need the shameful retrograde step of €12 million of the budget for mental health services to be rerouted to other areas of the health service. Mental health services should never be seen as an easy target. When it comes to our young people we need to think outside the box and be resourceful about how we engage with them about their mental health. According to the My World Survey, which was a collaboration between Headstrong and UCD, 70% of 12 to 25 year olds say that with one good adult in their lives, they are connected, self-confident, future-looking and can cope with problems. One action that can be taken quickly to build on this is a reversal of the decision in budget 2012 to remove the ex-quota guidance allocation in second level schools. This has led to a reduction of 51.4% in the time allocated to guidance counselling services.Cuts to such services reduce the opportunity for young people to have crucial easy access to professionally trained counsellors. The ex-quota guidance provision in second level schools must be restored and, if the will and commitment is present, the Thirty-second Dáil has the power. This House can prove to be instrumental in making a real difference by saying "no more attacks on our most vulnerable citizens". It will be the litmus test for what is now described as "new politics". We should formally embrace, at the highest level, the evidence-based approach to mental wellness as well as treating mental illness. Some of the most vulnerable are vulnerable by virtue of the fact they simply do not have the toolbox of skills to cope at a time of crisis. We need to sow the seeds of mental wellness within our families and our schools. The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health should work together on innovative ways to reduce the incidence of mental illness and on the promotion of happiness and mental resilience among our children. According to research, 20% of children show symptoms of anxiety and a recent survey by Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, revealed that family issues, neglect and mental health difficulties are proving to be the greatest challenges faced by schools. The same survey indicated that three in every four principals feel inadequately trained to deal with such problems as they arise. Schools in different parts of the country are doing different things, such as the roots of empathy programme, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, Paws b and school completion programmes, to name but a few. However, what is really required is a more standardised approach where all schools receive the same support and resources and where such excellent initiatives are formally adopted rather than squeezed into a very busy school academic year. School-based counselling is the norm in many countries around the world. We need to explore the feasibility of providing such counsellors in schools, including primary schools, in this country too. We need to nip things in the bud. Prevention can be key. Let us lead by effectively showing more passion for prevention, as well as supporting comprehensive strategies for treating mental illness. We need to establish research teams, design resilience building programmes, train teachers and create new posts for specialist teachers in this area. In some secondary schools, excellent work is taking place, such as Headstrong and Jigsaw, where vulnerable teenagers are targeted and their psychological needs addressed accordingly. Unfortunately, such programmes are sporadic and not available in every region. These programmes and initiatives must be further developed nationwide and properly funded. We need to consider designing and making similar initiatives available to primary school children. Alongside the full implementation of A Vision for Change, we need a vision for sustaining mental wellness. Research is emphatic about the benefits of mindfulness in alleviating symptoms of mental illness. Innovative and overly stretched teachers are teaching its practice in some of our schools. In many countries, it has been integrated within their educational systems because of its potential to reduce vulnerability to mental illness. In the UK, more than 400 secondary schools offer mindfulness meditation programmes. The Department for Education there has designated schools as pioneer schools for mindfulness teaching and it has invested more than £1 million to help other schools benefit too. A more uniformed and formal approach is key where we move away from where mindfulness is squeezed into the day through the generosity of a teacher, who sought and paid for his or her own training, to a system that trains all teachers and supports all schools. Our young people's sense of well-being should be at the heart of education. Ní thagann an óige faoi dhó. Ní mór dúinn cuimhniú gur rud leochaileach é intinn pháiste nó intinn dhéagóra agus tá dualgas orainn sochaí chineálta a chothú. Enough time, with its lethal consequences, has been lost, too many years now where mental health has continued to be the Cinderella of our nation's health service. This is fundamentally a crucial test for society through its politics. We must not be sidelined or sidetracked into narrow party political concerns, and this makes the current delay of 60 days and more in forming a government all the more shameful. The soon to be Taoiseach and his Government, if the will is there, can place mental well-being at the top of new politics. If the political will is there, it is easily achievable to lead effectively from the front and insist on the implementation of real positive changes to our mental health services. Mental Health must be a priority of the next government. No more delays. In the words of Benjamin Franklin: "You may delay, but time will not, and lost time is never found again."
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The banks are deliberately overcharging homeowners unlucky enough to be stuck with variable rate mortgages. The banks do this because they can. A family with an average mortgage in the State can now lose up to €400 per month or up to €100,000 over the lifetime of a mortgage. This is money unjustifiably taken from ordinary families and stolen from the real economy. The irony is that the real economy and its health are where our economic salvation lies. Those who rob from the real economy rob us all of our futures. This is not backing brave, it is attacking brave. It is hard to credit that the banks which were saved by the taxpayer can now, in the teeth of that rescue, gouge homeowners in such a shocking way. It is shocking and it is immoral but, perhaps most awfully, it is treacherous. How can we explain this to those hundreds of thousands of families who daily strive to pay their home loans in the face of financial challenges? How can we explain to them tonight? They have suffered the extra taxes, reduced incomes and all the hardship required to bail out the banks and now those same banks steal from them. Something must be done and it is our duty in the House to act. I commend the efforts of Deputy Michael McGrath who has been a constant voice in this area and I agree with him that banks will not act voluntarily and must be forced. Where I take issue, however, is with the Bill before the House. It is drafted with such infirmities that it could never in its current form hope to see the light of day. It would not pass the test of constitutionality and would inevitably be struck down. The banks know this, the civil servants know this and the Government knows this. Let us not give them all a told-you-so moment in the sun. While there is a process on Committee Stage whereby Bills can be amended, this Bill cannot be amended as it is inherently and fundamentally flawed. It would be much better and safer from the perspective of hard-pressed borrowers to start again. What is required is thorough consultation and endeavours to bring the Members of the Thirty-second Dáil together in an unprecedented collaborative approach, coming together as legislators from the get-go. This approach would safeguard against losing valuable time and avoid an imminent and most serious setback when this flawed legislation is inevitably deemed unconstitutional. In fairness, it is not hard to get a sense of what the Bill seeks to achieve. It seeks to create some objective standard by which a regulator can measure whether banks are overcharging. This is a difficult process when private parties have signed up to private contracts allowing one party later to retrospectively change the rate charged. The genuine effort and the laudable purpose is not achieved by the Bill in the form presented. The Bill as drafted requires the Central Bank to form a conclusion on an assessment which is so broad and vague in its terms on the state of competition in the market that in its current form it makes very little sense. The conclusion the Central Bank must reach is whether a market failure exists. Market failure is defined as a situation in which a lender is charging a variable interest rate which is higher than the Central Bank considers to be reasonably justified. Where the Central Bank came to such a conclusion, it could direct a lender not to charge a variable rate exceeding a rate specified by the Central Bank. The direction could be in regard to loans generally or to categories of loans or even to a particular loan. For example, theoretically the regulator who made the direction could himself direct that his own lender reduce his own personal mortgage rate and the bank would be powerless to challenge such biased direction. He could direct that those who took out loans after 2005 be given a massive reduction while others could be forgotten. In short, he could do whatever he wanted unchecked by any supervisory or other power. A direction under the Bill could be for an indefinite duration of time and could not be appealed by the lender to the High Court or to any other tribunal. As such, the Bill at its core gives the Central Bank the power to set variable interest rates for the banks. This is a huge power to vest in an organ of the State and would render the banks entirely dependent on the whim of the regulator. It would be unprecedented internationally as it could apply to a single loan and, therefore, to a single borrower just as much as to every loan. It is whatever the Central Bank wants. There is no appeal to the courts. The role of the courts is usurped or ousted and there is no chance to challenge a decision which might be crucial to the survival of an institution. I have further concerns that no mechanism is envisaged by which either side could be heard during an assessment. There is no right to be heard which appears to breach a fundamental principle of natural justice, especially when there is no right of appeal from a decision taken against one. This decision may be one that is crucial to a party. As much as anyone, I am appalled at what the banks have done to this country and what they continue to do. However, this Bill will not help our cause. There is a duty on all of us in opposition and in government, especially in this era of new politics, to bring forward Bills in a manner which is not populist, rushed or sensationalist. This is particularly the case when considering the precarious voting arithmetic of the new Dáil and, especially, when dealing with emotive and hugely important issues. We have a duty to consider carefully the legislation so that if it were enacted it would not create more delay and mischief than it seeks to redress. The Bill for all its good intentions would if enacted set aside decades of carefully established rights to fair procedures.To the crowd and those suffering under the burden of excess rates, this may be an immediate issue, but as legislators, we must look further down the road and be cognisant of the unseen consequences.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is crucial that we get this right from the start. We propose that the Bill in its current form be withdrawn and presented again as soon as possible. Not in six months' time as in the Minister's proposed amendment, as six months is too long and does not acknowledge the urgency of this matter, but as soon as possible once the Bill is capable of passing the basic tests of constitutionality.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	De réir saineolaithe idirnáisiúnta, tá an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht ag cúlu go tapaidh mar theanga laethúil an phobail. Go bunúsach, tá todhchaí na Gaeltachta i mbaol. Cad is Gaeltacht ann? An áit fisiciúil nó meon aigne í? Nó an bhfuil an dá rud fite fuaite lena chéile? Caithfear an cheist a chur ar gach Teachta Dála: cad é a bhfuil ar bun agat i do Dháilcheantar féin chun cás na teanga a chothú? Braitheann pobal na Gaeilge orainn uilig ceannaireacht a léiriú i dtaobh cearta agus seirbhísí teanga a chur chun cinn. Mo náire sinn mar Theachtaí Dála má thréigimid aisling na Gaeltachta.  Is seoid náisiúnta luachmhar chultúrtha í an Ghaeltacht agus tá dualgas orainn uilig í a chosaint do na glúine a thiocfaidh inár ndiaidh. Ní mór dúinn cuimhneamh gurb é an difríocht idir Gaeilge phobail na Gaeltachta agus an Ghaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ná gur slabhra neamhbhriste lenár sinsir Cheilteacha í teanga phobail na Gaeltachta. Síneann fréamhacha na teanga siar i bhfad roimh ré na Normannach, roimh ionsaí na Lochlannach, roimh ré na Críostaíochta agus fiú siar go dtí ré na miotaseolaíochta. Ach dealraítear go bhfuil meath le brath sa Ghaeltacht de dheasca easpa seirbhísí Gaeilge, easpa tacaíochta an Stáit agus bagairt an Bhéarla chuile áit. Is ceist phráinneach í an meath seo. Is é seo am an ghátair do chainteoirí dúchais. De réir fhigiúirí dhaonáireaimh 2011, cé go ndeireann 41.4% go bhfuil siad ina gcainteoirí Gaeilge, ní úsáideann ach 1.8% de dhaoine an Ghaeilge ar bhonn laethúil. Is é sin 77,185 duine. Faraor, níl ach duine as triúr dóibh siúd ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht. Is maith is eol dúinn go bhfuil athrú aeráide mar bhagairt ar an timpeallacht agus go bhfuil an timpeallacht i mbaol. Mar an gcéanna, dearbhaíonn an Comhaontas Glas go bhfuil todhchaí na Gaeltachta i mbaol. Tá géarghá le haghaidh plean éigeandála tarrthála gan a thuilleadh moille. Obair in aisce a bheidh sa Stráitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge gan infheistíocht chuimsitheach i seirbhisí tacaíochta do theaghlaigh agus seirbhísí don óige. Caithfear tús áite a thabhairt do na ceantair Ghaeltachta ina bhfuil an lámh in uachtar ag an teanga mar theanga an phobail. Is riachtanas é ó thaobh saibhreas na teanga canúintí nádúrtha traidisiúnta na Gaeltachta a chaomhnú don todhchaí, maraon leis an gcaighdeán oifigiúil. Is riachtanas é ard-chaighdeán Gaeilge a bheith ag ábhar oidí agus múinteoirí ó thaobh sealbhú teanga. Ach, i roinnt ceantair faoi láthair, tá saibhreas na Gaeilge á chailliúint mar thoradh ar thionchar an Bhéarla agus easpa seirbhísí tacaíochta Gaeilge. Is údar imní é nach bhfuil Roinn Rialtais freagrach as tithíocht sa Ghaeltacht, rud a chinnteoidh cosaint na teanga. Caithfear dul i ngleic le cúrsaí tithíochta agus tacú leis na teaghlaigh atá ag déanamh a seacht ndícheall ár dteanga agus ár n-oidhreacht a chaomhnú agus a chothú. Tá frustrachas ar phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá dualgas orainne, mar pholaiteoirí i nDáil Éireann, cluas éisteachta a thabhairt do lucht na Gaeltachta iad féin agus dá gcuid éilimh ar mhaithe le stádas na Gaeilge a neartú. Ba chóir don Rialtas a chinntiú go mbunófar an lár-ionad náisiúnta don oideachas i mBaile Bhuirne atá geallta le fada an lá. Ba chóir cúramaí Údarás na Gaeltachta a leathnú ón tionsclú go dtí cúramaí sóisialta, cultúrtha agus teanga. Is féidir linn foghlaim ó thaithí mhuintir na Breataine Bige agus muintir na hAlban agus bonn reachtúil a bheith againn maidir le cur i bhfeidhim straitéis náisiunta, Gaeltachta agus áitiúla.Má táimid dáiríre faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, caithfear cearta Gaeilge a neartú seachas iad a mhaolú agus a laghdú. Molann an Comhaontas Glas go mbunófar aonad na Gaeilge i Roinn an Taoisigh chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear an tAcht seo i bhfeidhm i ngach eagraíocht Stáit agus i ngach Roinn. In ainneoin meath na Gaeltachta, is cosúil go bhfuil fás agus forbairt ag teacht ar líon na nGaelscoileanna ó cheann ceann na tíre. Tá 305 bunscoil ar an oileán seo againne: 126 sa Ghaeltacht, 144 lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus 35 sna Sé Chontae. Ag eascairt as an dearcadh dearfach seo, caithfear géarchéim na Gaeltachta a phlé agus réiteach a fháil ar na dúshláin. Is fúinne atá sé mar pholaiteoirí tacaíocht a thabhairt don chainteoir ó dhúchais nach bhfuil sa mhóramh a thuilleadh agus sealbhú na teanga a chinntiú. Dar le hÁine Ní Neachtain, comhbhunaitheoir Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta, "In áit an foghlaimeoir a bheith báite i measc na gcainteoirí dúchais mar a bhíodh is é a mhalairt atá ag tarlú sa Ghaeltacht sa lá atá inniu ann". Is fúinne uilig atá sé sa Teach seo brú a chur ar Airí tearmainn teanga a chothú do theaghlaigh Gaeltachta agus maoiniú a thabhairt dóibh ionas go mbeidh rath ar shealbhú teanga dá bpáistí agus don fhoghlaimeoir sa mhórthimpeall feasta. Creideann an Comhaontas Glas go mba chóir cumhacht bhreise a thabhairt don Choimisinéir Teanga le cinntiú gur Gaeilge chruinn cheart a bheidh ar chomharthaí poiblí agus comharthaí bóthair, ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud na tíre. Maidir leis na meáin chumarsáide, tá éacht déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta, RTE agus ag TG4 le 20 bliain anuas, maraon le craoltóirí príobháideacha feasta.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish the Minister well in his new role. He has assumed a responsibility which carries the hopes of many of the various and numerous stakeholders in education. Guím gach beannacht ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna ar bhonn proifisiúnta agus go pearsanta sa Dáil seo. I echo the words of other elected Members and express my frustration that Deputies were not afforded the requisite time to consider thoroughly and interrogate properly these Estimates and their impact on our education system which is one of the most important influencers on the success of the country, the economy and, more important, society. Not only is the receipt of such figures at the 11th hour disrespectful to us, as parliamentarians, but laying them before the House in this way without a proper briefing is disrespectful to all the educators working in the sector and the young people who will ultimately be impacted by the quality of our engagement in education strategy. While I have had only a few hours to review the Estimates, I have a few comments to make. I recognise and welcome the Government’s commitment to the delivery of a strategy for education in its first 100 days and look forward to contributing positively and constructively to this strategy. However, I am not heartened by what I have read in the Estimates. While there are a few moves, small though they may be, towards trying to put right some of the deeper and more painful cuts implemented in recent years, for example, the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios and the increase of 7% in the number of special needs assistants, what I have not heard is any indication from the Minister that he intends to address the serious inequality in the teaching profession. We do not have a two-tier system but a three-tier system in which newly-qualified teachers earn in excess of 20% less than their colleagues, despite doing exactly the same job with exactly the same responsibilities as colleagues. A recent OECD report, Education at a Glance, found a direct correlation between teachers’ pay and quality of education. The teaching profession in this country has been devalued and demoralised and this will have a detrimental effect on the future quality of education. Put simply, how can the Minister justify a position that is contrary to the principle of equal pay for equal work? The programme for Government refers to principles of access, excellence, transparency and innovation and to tackling disadvantage in the education system, yet I do not see anything in the Estimates on restoring the ex quota guidance allocation to second level schools. Cuts to these services reduced the opportunity for young people to have crucial easy access to professionally trained counsellors. The removal of a dedicated guidance counselling service has widened the gap between those who have and those who have not. In some schools parents have the financial resources to ensure their children's school has access to guidance counsellors, while in other schools access to the educational, vocational and support service provided by counsellors has been radically reduced. Surely all children should have equal access to this service, irrespective of which school they attend. To ensure equal access, a financial commitment must be made to ensure the full restoration of the ex quota guidance allocation in schools and ring-fenced guidance counsellors hours to the position that obtained prior to budget 2012. This will ensure we have a dedicated fit-for-purpose guidance counsellor services in all our schools for all our children.Where in these Estimates is the statement of intent, the appetite to deliver something truly radical and innovative? The extra special needs assistants provision is of course welcome news for children and parents of children who have special educational needs. Extra psychologists for the under-resourced National Educational Psychological Service, as indicated in the programme for Government, should help to ease the waiting time for education assessments and should be welcomed too. All of this is good news, but we have nothing new here. There is no innovation. A stopgap approach to education is disappointing, to say the least. We need more than filling in the holes or easing the pressure points within the system. The programme for Government states: "We now have an opportunity to change our approach in some aspects of education". These Estimates do not indicate that such an opportunity is being taken. The opportunity to place our children's well-being centre stage is being overlooked. The Department should look at establishing a task force to design and deliver evidence-based strategies to promote resilience within our schools, utilising the top experts in the field. We need to be evidence-based and standardised in our approach. Funding should be provided for initiating research into what strategies and interventions can be harnessed within school communities to reduce children's vulnerability to depression and anxiety. In many countries all schools, primary and secondary, have a full-time school-based counsellor. In Britain, schools are piloting mindfulness-based programmes where leader schools provide other schools with education and resources. I am not suggesting for one minute that we increase the pressure on our under-resourced, overstretched and demoralised teachers. However, there is an opportunity to try something new and initiate a pilot project on building resilience and teaching mindfulness to our children. There needs to be a formal link, a new conversation, between the Departments of Health and Education and Skills to promote mental wellness among our children, provide them with pathways to inner happiness, allow them to discover and develop their inner strengths and provide them with the tools for coping with challenges. Too often, our children can attain wonderful results in the leaving certificate but crumble to pieces when confronted with their first crisis in college or the workplace. If this new politics is to present an opportunity to shape collectively the future of education in our country, as the Minister said tonight, then I respectfully request that members of the education committee hear from the Minister next month on his specific spending proposals for 2017. Members of the committee should be informed of what the Department has been negotiating with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of same.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I commend Deputy Niamh Smyth on bringing this motion to the House. I and my Green Party colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan will be more than happy to support it. Without the necessary governmental support the arts cannot flourish, and we need them to flourish for the very sake of our heritage. We need the arts to be strong and independent. Yet Ireland is currently ranked at the bottom of the European league for Government investment in culture and the arts. It is essential that we consider and recognise in the House how intrinsic the arts are to our soul as a nation. Tá clú agus cáil ar ealaíontóirí, filí, scríbhneoirí is ceoltóirí an náisiúin seo ar fud an domhain. Cloistear rithim an tsaoil sa cheol. Mar chine Ceilteach, tá tobar na samhlaíochta go smior inár gcnámha ó chianaibh. Ach táim buartha nach bhfuil an Stát faoi láthair airdeallach go leor ar na dushláin a bhfuil le sárú ag lucht ealaíne na linne seo ó thaobh maoiniú a chur ar fáil do na hearnálacha proifisiúnta agus áitiúla. Cé go gcaithfear geilleagar an tíre a bheathú, caithfear an cheist seo leanas a chur freisin. Cá mbeadh sochaí na hÉireann gan ionsporáid agus fealsúnacht na n-ealaín? Is tríd ár gcuid litríochta, filíochta, amhránaíochta agus cruthaitheachta a gcuirfimid ár n-oidhreacht agus ár bhféiniúlacht in iúl ní hamháin don domhan ach dúinn féin mar Éireannaigh. Is trí phroiséas na cruthaitheachta a nochtar macasamhail, coinsias agus cuisle chine.  Is maith an scáthán súl ealaíontóra ar anam na ndaoine. Soláthraíonn an dánlann, an amharclann agus an iarsmalann tearmann dúinn ó thrioblóidí an tsaoil ionas gur féidir linn teacht chugainn féin agus tuiscint a bheith againn ar ár mothúcháin daonna agus ar ár n-áit sa domhan. Mar shochaí, caithfimid a bheith dílis dár dtraidisiún cruthaitheachta agus tairseach na samhlaíochta a thrasnú i dteannta le chéile. Tá fíorú físe na todhchaí á lorg againn. Is údar imní é nach n-aithníonn an Rialtas nua seo luach saothar na n-ealaíon gan trácht ar shaibhreas oidhreacht na nGael mar chroílar an náisiúin seo. Ó thaobh an gheilleagair, ní mór dúinn cuimhneamh go dtagann na mílte turasóirí go hÉireann ar thóir na n-ealaíon. Is scannalach an rud é sa lá atá inniu ann nach gceapann an Rialtas gur fiú Roinn le stádas neamhspleách a bheith ag an earnáil oidhreachta agus ealaíne. Is náire atá ann don Rialtas.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I commend Deputy O'Sullivan for bringing this Bill to the House and look forward to a time when these barbaric practices are outlawed in Ireland. The Green Party has always been opposed to all blood sports and remains resolutely so. Needless to say the Green Party will be supporting this Bill. I ask Members tonight to consider the words of Abraham Lincoln, who said:I am in favour of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the way of a whole human being. Labhair me inné faoi thábhacht chosaint agus cothú bhua an ealaíontóra. Sa leabhar Dúil le Liam Ó Flaithearta feictear an bua sin ina chur síos ar iontas an dúlra agus ríocht na n-ainmhithe. Is tír muid le háiseanna nádúrtha den scoth timpeall orainn, ach ní féidir leis na hainmhithe seo maireachtáil le cur isteach agus slad an duine daonna. An bhfuil sé ceart cur isteach ar an ngiorria atá anseo leis na céadta bliain? Is cuid dár n-oidhreacht é an créatúr seo. Níl guth aige, ach tá guth agamsa. Tá guth againne mar pholaiteoirí, agus táimid freagrach as tuairimí an phobail a thabhairt os comhair an Tí uasal seo. Ni féidir linn leanúint leis an nós barbartha seo. 'Sé sin dul sa tóir ar ainmhí leochaileach gan chosaint. To be absolutely clear, hare coursing is a brutal ordeal. Before the hares experience this ordeal, they are trapped and trained which is cruel enough. They are solitary creatures and keep to themselves in the wild, so keeping them in an enclosure causes significant stress and fear. Hare coursing involves the terrorising of one animal by another animal as a so-called sport, all the while being watched as entertainment. Not only are these timid and delicate creatures terrified and brutalised in this practice, they often suffer severe injuries and death. The hare is a brittle-boned creature and its internal injuries cannot heal. Injured hares have to be put down. The last Private Members' Bill to ban coursing was taken more than 20 years ago and, unfortunately, was defeated. The solution on that occasion was to call on coursing clubs to muzzle the hounds. Muzzling the dogs is not an answer nor is it any less barbaric. Many hares die from stress and exhaustion and hares continue to be mauled and struck by the greyhounds resulting in their death. Since the introduction of muzzling for greyhounds in 1993, deaths remain at approximately 200 hares per year. Hares are still dying either through contact injury, fear or capture myopathy. Up to 40 hares have died at any one event with vets blaming the significant stress of captivity and coursing. The hare is a protected species under the 2013 Habitats Directive. This document notes the significant fluctuations in population numbers. We cannot be certain they are well preserved as a species. Many members of this House, past and present, from across the entire political spectrum have, over the past 20 years, spoken out against this cruel, barbaric practice but when it comes down to it - when it comes to the vote - they choose to toe the party line rather than do the right thing. An mbeidh Teachtaí Dála sa Pharlaimint seo sona sásta filleadh abhaile an Déardaoin seo chugainn agus a rá lena gclanna go raibh eagla orthu an rud ceart a dhéanamh agus nach raibh siad cróga go leor an fód a sheasamh agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do Bhille na mná misniúla, an Teachta Maureen O'Sullivan? Carpe diem. Bígí láidir. Léirígí misneach agus tuiscint. Why are we only one of three countries still allowing this practice? Why can we not reach a consensus in this House and get hare coursing banned once and for all? Let us take this opportunity presented by Deputy O'Sullivan to say that this practice clearly belongs in the past and is no longer acceptable to the vast majority of Irish people. Independent surveys carried out over the years have shown that approximately 75% or more people would like to see a ban in place and this is not just urban dwellers. The majority of those in rural areas are also opposed to this so-called sport. Let us follow our nearest neighbours in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and let us ban this barbaric activity which sometimes trades under the name of being a sport. It is not a sport. Describing it as a sport does a gross disservice to what true sport involves. We only have to think of last night in Lille as an example of one of so many true sports. It was full of honest and brave endeavour and unpredictability. We had 11 players against 11 players - a fair battle. Hare coursing is anything but fair. It is cruel and barbaric and I believe that if not next Thurday, our generation will once and for all end this cowardly cruelty. I hope it happens sooner rather than later. I conclude with the words of a former Member of this House, the former Green Party leader, Trevor Sargent, who said, "I feel we have reached a point in our history where almost unanimous agreement has been reached in rejecting political violence and, to ensure that society develops respecting life in general, it is important I believe to reject violence in the name of 'sport' also."
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House and I welcome the introduction of a paternity leave entitlement. Some 40 years ago, Sweden became the first country in the world to introduce paid parental leave. However, it is only now in 2016 that fathers in Ireland will have access to any kind of paid paternity leave. The Nordic countries, when dealing with parental leave, operate under the assumption that children under the age of one are best cared for at home. How a child is cared for during the first year after birth is of utmost importance for his or her development. Studies have found that the placement of infants outside the home in the first year after birth can have negative developmental impacts.We must ensure that every parent has the freedom and ability to do what is best for his or her child. For children to develop secure attachments to the main care givers, it is essential that parents have the ability to take time to care for their children during this crucial period without fear of financial burden. The fathers of this country are an integral part of that, and it is well past time that the House has sought to create security for them to be able to make that attachment with their children, which in turn gives greater security and care to infants. I strongly welcome the introduction of a paternity leave entitlement. However, I also believe that to ensure the best interests of the newborn children and the parents of this country we must continue to expand statutory leave entitlements for both parents. We must also move towards an approach that is oriented towards parental leave encompassing both parents, rather than a system which makes a strong distinction between paid maternity leave of 26 weeks and paid paternity leave of only two weeks, with the only provision of parental leave being an unpaid one. Currently, while we have equality between both parents for access to unpaid parental leave, this entitlement has created its own inequalities in our society. In the words of my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the House more than ten years ago: "if parents are poor and cannot afford to take parental leave because of a loss of salary, the Government is saying, 'Sorry, this is not for you'." While there is an entitlement to paid maternity leave, this does not fully recognise the partnership of both parents in families where this is applicable. We must create a system with a paid entitlement which everybody can avail of and which recognises that every parent has a unique role to play. The paternity leave entitlement created in this Bill seeks to complement existing paid maternity leave benefits, and I welcome the provisions of the Bill that allow this provision to be passed to the other parent upon the tragic possibility of the death of one parent. However, while it is crucial that we do not reduce the important existing maternity leave benefits available to new mothers, comprehensive reform must be introduced which helps both parents to care for their child properly in the early, formative years of his or her life. Parenthood can be a partnership, and it is important that we allow families with two parents the flexibility to work as a partnership. The introduction of paid parental leave for the first six months after birth in addition to existing maternity leave would be a much more appropriate system for the 21st century. With this legislation the House is getting the ball rolling on an issue that still requires comprehensive reform to fully realise how we view parenthood, and how we seek to act in the best interests of our children. It is still only papering over the holes in our parental leave system. I welcome the Bill, as two weeks is better than none, but I call on the Government to continue to phase in entitlements to which all parents will have access, be they rich or poor, mothers or fathers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While the referendum on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union was decided by a myriad of forces and the reasons people voted the way they did must be assessed in the fullness of time in the cold light of day, we must, first and foremost, respect the democratic decision taken by our neighbours. On this momentous and challenging occasion, I am reminded of the words of Martin Luther King: "We have inherited a large house, a great world 'world house' in which we have to live together - black and white, easterner and westerner, Gentile and Jew, Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Hindu - a family unduly separated in ideas, culture and interest, who, because we can never again live apart, must learn somehow to live with each other in peace." This concept of inclusivity, stability and peace is a fundamental pillar of the European Union. It is the responsibility not only of the European Union and each member state but also of every citizen of the EU to face up to and play his or her part in challenging the politics of anger and intolerance which offers no solutions and is simply and solely populist and extreme in nature. It would be very foolish of the European Union not to accept some responsibility for the outcome of the referendum. However strong and toxic the prevailing force of intolerance may be, it was not the sole reason for the referendum result. The EU played into the hands of extremists and racists by compounding instead of tackling the disconnect felt by so many citizens who feel left behind, forgotten and disadvantaged in what they perceive to be a Union that has become primarily about serving and benefiting an elite and privileged class and does not support the vulnerable and weak. Member states, as well as individuals, feel alienated in what appears to be an inexorable drive to create a super-state. This is a time for calm and reflection. From speaking to Green Party colleagues in Britain, one of the most regrettable aspects of the referendum is that it appears that while many of the electorate may have known why they voted to leave the EU, some did not appreciate exactly what they were voting to accept and the consequences of the decision. Major long-term issues were at stake, including the very future of the United Kingdom, yet the complexities and significant consequences of the decision were not adequately explained in advance of the vote. Perhaps this is because the UK lacks experience in holding referendums, having previously held only two such polls. It is a shame an independent referendum commission was not in place to explain with expert and independent authority the likely consequences and outcomes associated with either a "Leave" or "Remain" vote. Precipitated by a number of legal challenges in this jurisdiction, the State has, fortunately, an impartial statutory commission in place which is accessible to all. In this respect, the UK could take a leaf out of our book or at least consult and learn from us in case further referendums come down the line. Another outcome of the referendum was the immediate call made here for a Border poll. I would love to see a united Ireland by peaceful means. As someone who was born and reared in the Border area, I know at first hand how destructive and divisive borders can be. While we do not want physical borders to return, much more work is needed to remove what is, in many respects, an even more important and debilitating border, namely, the psychological border caused by the deep hurt, pain and suffering that are still pervasive and present for many in both communities. Surely the motivation behind calls for a Border poll should be that it may be successful. I state the obvious in asking how a poll could possibly be successful when the entire leadership of one community in the North is not on board, having flatly dismissed the idea. It appears the leaders of Irish Unionism were not even consulted on the call for a Border poll. This is, at the very least, a very poor start if one is serious about achieving a successful outcome. The call for a Border poll is premature and ill thought-out. It lacks credibility and a sense of reality. Surely at this stage, after all that people, North and South, have been through in the Troubles, we should accept the overriding principle that reconciliation, mutual respect, tolerance and inclusivity must be front and centre. Reconciliation and the ultimate goal of a united Ireland mean bringing people together at all times and fostering trust, rather than producing snap unilateral proposals that exclude rather than include and instil fear rather than building much-needed trust and confidence. Conducting a Border poll at this time would alienate people and prove divisive, thereby running the risk of turning the vote into a sectarian head count. Moreover, the vote would inevitably be lost, which would set back by a generation the ultimate goal of achieving a united Ireland. The European Union was founded on the "together we are better" principle based on mutuality, respect and co-operation. We must fight to keep this principle at the forefront of our thoughts as we enter an uncertain future. After the Second World War, Europe was an extremely fractured and divided Continent. The formation of the European Economic Community helped bring stability and reconciliation to nations that had been at war. This potential to heal and deliver stability is needed again. It is a shame that the European Union's potential for good hardly featured during the recent referendum campaign. More than ever, we in our capacity as individual EU citizens must implore Ireland as a member state to emphasise and extol the force for good the European Union can be. Ní neart go cur le chéile.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tógfaidh mé ceithre nóiméad. I welcome this Bill because I strongly believe we need to reform fundamentally the schools admission practices in all State-funded schools and ensure equality of access, participation and opportunity in our schools. While what is proposed in this Bill is preferable to the current system, it does not go far enough. What is required is quite simple: no State-funded school should be able to discriminate for or against a child on the basis of his or her religion. How can it be fair that a child who lives right beside a school and whose name was the first to be placed on the admissions list can miss out on a place because he or she is not of the preferred religion? Of course there is a place for freedom of religion and religious schools in Ireland. This should be both recognised and respected, but not in an exclusive way. Taxpayers’ money should not be funding discrimination. Our children are growing up in a worrying time. This worry is caused not just by the external existential threat of climate change, but also by the much more frightening human threats of hate, fear, anger, intolerance and violence. In recent times, we have seen the rise of far-right nationalism in Europe, the nomination of Donald Trump as a candidate for the Presidency of the USA and the anti-immigration rhetoric that fuelled large parts of the ultimately successful "Leave" campaign in the Brexit referendum. All of this leaves me more concerned for our children's future than I have ever been before. It has left me with an even stronger conviction that we must fight this fear with courage, this anger with love and this hate with tolerance. We must defeat exclusion and alienation with inclusivity in everything we do, including how we educate our children. The most valuable lesson any child can learn is that of respect and love for all the people around him or her, regardless of their ethnicity, their religion, the language they speak or where they are from. No danger is greater to our children than the danger of isolation and insulation. It is a great tragedy if a child cannot encounter other children who come from different backgrounds, cultures, points of view, ways of life or religious beliefs. A child who cannot interact with the wonderful diversity of our country and our world to the fullest possible extent is a child whose childhood is not as rich as it should be. Our schools are where our children make friends. While the religious ethos of so many of our schools is helping to shape the good values of the people of our country, no child should be denied a possible friend because he or she prays in a different way, or he or she does not pray at all. In saying this, I acknowledge the huge contribution made by the religious to education over hundreds of years. They were often the only educators who were playing an invaluable role at home and abroad. They are renowned throughout the world. In years gone by, they provided education in a voluntary capacity, and at times at great risk to their own lives. We must also acknowledge, embrace and cater for a changing modern society in which all our children are treated equally when it comes to education. Religious discrimination has no place in modern society. All schools in receipt of State funding should be fair, transparent and inclusive in their admissions policies. Discrimination on the basis of religion would not be tolerated in any other walk of life and the education system should be no different.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the Bill. The Green Party will be supporting it. My colleagues in our Technical Group, the Social Democrats, have asked me to express their support for the Bill but, owing to the change in speaking arrangements tonight, they did not get an opportunity to speak. Tonight, we have an opportunity, in a small way, to ease the suffering of parents going on an horrific personal journey, a journey with an inevitable, heartbreaking conclusion. Currently, parents facing a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality and trying to deal with this extremely difficult situation have their upset compounded by their being forced to travel abroad, often feeling like they are sneaking away rather than being closely supported by their families in their own country and by the trusted doctors and nurses on this difficult journey with them. This needs to change. These couples need practical support by translating words, however genuine, into doing our utmost to take action. They need the type of support that many of our medical professionals want to give them. Doctors are powerless, however, and the best they can do is refer these couples to foreign jurisdictions. In this debate this evening, I have heard some legalistic concerns articulated and relied upon as a reason to oppose the Bill. These concerns are largely misplaced because, in some respects, the Bill represents a real response by its proposers and supporters to address truly desperate, dreadful circumstances that they want to see end as soon as possible. It is, in essence, a type of declaratory action taken in the Dáil. If it passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, there will be a safety valve in place. Our Constitution provides that the President, if he has concerns, may refer the Bill directly to the Supreme Court, which can pronounce on it and, perhaps, lay out guidelines. In doing so, perhaps the Supreme Court could take into consideration the democratic will of the Houses of the Oireachtas.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. I shall speak for just one more moment. We have not seen any detailed or definitive legal opinion published by the Attorney General. Most importantly, no legal opinion has been published by the Attorney General or shared with us, as legislators, to assist us. The reality is that there can be no categorical presumption of the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the proposed legislation. In other words, relying upon a categorical or emphatic presumption or assumption would be unwise in these circumstances. Given the choice of supporting this, over which there is a huge question mark, and supporting the parents and bringing an end to their pain, I choose to support the Bill and support the parents.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will take four minutes. I acknowledge and thank all the Members in the House for uniting behind what started as a motion tabled by myself and my Green Party colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan, but has evolved into a strong cross-party motion under which we, as members of this House, cast party politics aside and unite today in seeking justice for an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa. We recognise that the Department and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have dedicated a lot of time, effort and resources to Ibrahim's case and a number of politicians from different parties have also kept in close contact with Ibrahim's family to see how best to ensure his safe return home. I met with the Egyptian ambassador and I regret to say I could take nothing from that meeting that gave me confidence or hope in the short term. With the further deferral of the trial process last week, it was clear that a more united approach is needed whereby we, as a Parliament, stand up for his rights and call on the Egyptian Government to exercise its powers under decree 140 in the Egyptian statute book to issue a presidential decree and ensure his release. We do so citing the fact that, when arrested three years ago, Ibrahim Halawa was a child of 17 years of age. His case has now been adjourned 14 times and he has been recognised by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience held for more than three years without a trial.Justice delayed is justice denied - that is, if one takes a huge leap of faith that Egypt operates a proper system of real justice, but there is no evidence to date that it does. We propose that a parliamentary delegation from this House visit the Egyptian Parliament, and Ibrahim, to help resolve matters. We look forward to hearing from the Egyptian ambassador in that regard. She must start to appreciate that many have zero confidence in Egypt's purported system of justice. I hope there will be a speedy response from her as we try to comprehend the anguish that Ibrahim's family has been feeling over the past three years. I welcome members of Ibrahim's family to Leinster House today as they watch this debate, and commend the way in which they have tirelessly campaigned for his release in a peaceful and determined manner. We must exhaust all options in ensuring Ibrahim's release, but a stage may be arrived at where all our diplomatic representations and efforts continue to fail, including perhaps a direct intervention by the Taoiseach where, rather than telephone calls, a face-to-face meeting of the Taoiseach with the Egyptian President is requested as a matter of urgency, with Ibrahim being the sole issue on the agenda. Should that fail, however, I suggest that at that stage it may become necessary for the Egyptian authorities to be made aware that some consideration would have to be given to suspending diplomatic relations with a country which continues to unjustifiably detain one of our citizens who was a child at the time of his arrest and that this is unacceptable. Ibrahim Halawa - we say his name loudly and clearly here today so that Egypt hears one united voice saying that Ireland will not stand for the continued imprisonment and ill treatment of Ibrahim - is one of our own. Standing up for him says something about our sense of ourselves as a nation. We are in many respects his only hope - his last hope - and I am glad that we are standing together here today to demand the release of our own citizen, Ibrahim Halawa.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This question relates to the Minister's announcement last week that the drafting of legislation has been approved as a matter of priority for the de-designation of 46 raised bogs. I am appalled that this Minister of all Ministers as the one who is supposed to have a special responsibility to protect and promote our heritage would under her watch allow, permit, and actively facilitate the destruction of an irreplaceable part of our heritage, allegedly as a matter of governmental priority when the patent truth for all to see is that this decision which was set in stone in the recent programme for Government, on page 51 to be exact, would appear to be singularly motivated by a lust for power at any price even if that means sacrificing or destroying part of our country's heritage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2005 the then Government committed to designating these raised bogs as NHAs as part of the compliance with an ECJ judgment. An inevitable part of that designation was ending turf cutting on them. This Government is rowing back on that commitment and claiming that the fact that it is going to do less than it said it would is some sort of success story. Our raised bogs are among the best examples of raised bog habitats left in Europe. In addition to their obvious biodiversity value, peatlands are very important carbon sinks. They also act like large sponges helping to protect us from flooding. After the many recent catastrophic floods does this Government not get how crucial it is to take preventative action and not the exact opposite? Worse still, when drained and harvested these bogs will go from being carbon sinks to very large carbon sources. The Minister can dress this up whatever way she wishes today but to the Green Party and to many others it is nothing more than a shameful destruction of our heritage all for the sake of a promise to support and keep this Government in power. Most unfortunate of all, there was an alternative solution for all which would have protected our heritage. Raised bogs can be traced back to the Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago and 10,000 years of heritage is now being bartered and traded for votes to keep the Minister and this Government in power. The way it is going this Government might not even see a few hundred days. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Are there management plans in place for those NHAs where turf cutting is due to end from 1 January 2017? If not, why is the Minister pressing ahead with de-designating 39 and partially de-designating seven in advance of arrangements being made to ensure that conservation objectives will be met on the reconfigured network of raised bog habitat recommended in the Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network in 2014? Our raised bogs and other parts of our environment are in jeopardy because successive Governments have tried to be all things to all men and made concessions they should never have made. These bogs are over 10,000 years old and are our heritage. They should never have been used as bargaining chips in Government negotiations. In simple terms, with this decision the Minister is setting fire to our past, our present and our future.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A Vision for Change was launched in 2006. That innovative document inspired hope and was a clear roadmap for a mental health service where our most vulnerable citizens would be placed at the heart of their personal journey to recovery. Ten years later the implementation of this excellent document has been appallingly slow. The tragic truth is our citizens with mental health difficulties have been let down. We need to revisit A Vision for Change and prioritise its full implementation to improve the mental health outcomes for adults and children in Ireland. Such work is vital and every resource should be made available to help those who are unwell or struggling with symptoms of mental ill health, but sometimes it seems the conversation is solely about our response to mental illness. It is time for this country to have a new conversation about sowing the seeds of mental wellness in our schools and communities. While the Green Party welcomes this motion before the House, we propose an amendment which would merely add to the proposed motion to address formally prevention as well as cure. In our amendment we request the Government to initiate a process of engagement and collaboration with relevant experts on this island and liaise with similar experts abroad to examine current resilience programmes being offered in schools and all other relevant mental health initiatives on offer, to determine their effectiveness, and to design and implement evidence-based intervention programmes at primary and secondary schools that promote resilience and measure the effectiveness of same. Our young people's sense of self-worth and self-belief are often so fragile that they shatter at the first crisis. Research from the world of psychology indicates that it is possible to teach children to be more resilient. Scientists have identified key traits or strengths that can be harnessed within children and cultivated within school communities that will help them thrive despite adversity and to achieve positive outcomes despite the obstacles they may face. We need to explore and engage with the experts from the world of positive psychology within Ireland and abroad in the knowledge that developing and implementing evidence-based intervention programmes, as outlined in our amendment, will be of critical benefit to our children. Similar initiatives are delivering superb results in countries like Australia, New Zealand, America and closer to home in the UK. Although some Members have spoken of positive psychology and resilience, I would respectfully bring to Members' attention that the proposed amendment by the Green Party is the only proposed amendment to this motion that specifically addresses prevention as well as cure. Surely we should be willing to embrace formally, at the highest level, the evidence-based approach to mental wellness as well as to treat mental ill health. Life is an imperfect journey. The reality is that challenges, setbacks and misfortunes are inevitable for everyone. I would ask the Members of this House who have spoken of the merits of this motion to take this opportunity to embrace the new politics we have all heard so much about since February and support the Green Party amendment, because alongside the full implementation of A Vision for Change we need a vision for sustaining mental wellness.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yesterday the Taoiseach said the budget had been based on prudent management. I agree, but only to the extent that the prudent and, no doubt, clever management relates primarily to the internal workings and machinations of government which only serves the Government, not the people and the real issues they face in their day-to-day lives. With super self-serving dexterity, the Government danced around most of the real issues such as truly tackling the housing supply issue and tackling the inequalities in education. Not one political hot potato was touched. Many references have been made to the budget as being a type of "Late Late Show" budget and I have to say I agree. The reason the budget has wound up with that descriptive label is that the Government has evidently shown clear and growing traits of being a "one for everyone in the audience" Government. Therein lies the problem. Unless it changes course and its priorities, that is the rock on which it could eventually perish.  The weeks leading up to the budget were dominated by a spin battle between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with the Independent Alliance and other Government Independents also getting in on the spin action. They have been taking credit, laying claim and claiming ownership of ideas. That is why the budget failed miserably. Having such a competitive distraction appeared to be the priority. The twin motives were the burning desire to claim credit, while at the same time avoiding having the courage to take any difficult decision at all. This has resulted, unfortunately, in us being left with a budget that fails to serve the medium to long-term needs of the country which should be the underlying principle of any budget. No doubt, it has been an immediate to short-term success for all those involved, as It has been a master class in governmental survival, while at the same time skilfully allowing an opposition party to save face. The price paid for pulling off this coup will become clearer as time passes. Politicians and political parties dodging bullets was the priority and the order of the day and placed way above the people. I say, "Well done," to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Independents in government. They have managed to avoid walking on any thin ice and are the winners for now. Unfortunately, they are the only winners, which is a very sad outcome because the losers are the people who have seen and will see the budget for what it is.  The budget lacks long-term planning and a strategic vision for the country. As Helen Keller said, the only thing worse than being blind is having sight and no vision. The people rightly expect any teething process for new politics bedding down to be long over and a mature, non-self-serving approach to put people before politics to take over, but they have been left disappointed and let down. With the limited resources available and in trying to do the impossible of keeping everyone happy for the time being, inevitably many people were left out or ignored. Young people have been left behind and let down in the budget. Yesterday the Minster, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, stated that in order to ensure the benefits of recovery were felt by all, all social welfare payments would increase by €5 per week. This statement might make some politicians feel good when they hear it for the first time, but it is simply incorrect and grossly inaccurate because not all social welfare payments will increase by €5. The youth were not included. The Government has decided that 18 to 24 year olds only deserve an increase of €2.70 per week and 25 year olds, an increase of €3.80 per week. It is a clear case of age discrimination. At a time when we should be aiming to bring young emigrants home from abroad, the Government introduces measures to alienate them further. The Minister says this is to encourage the youth to take up courses of education and engage in further training. I respectfully suggest a fairer way to encourage this would have been to remove the €200 euro charge for PLC courses that continues to act as an impediment to access and an obstacle to participation for many students. The budget has failed children in primary education. Primary school classes in Ireland are the second most overcrowded in the European Union, but the Government has decided to leave them as they are. There has been no effort to reduce class sizes; therefore, over 100,000 children in classes of 30 or more pupils have been left behind, forgotten and ignored in the budget. How can young primary school pupils receive the quality education they deserve and that their teachers have been trained to give in classes of that size? Primary schools remain the Cinderella of the education sector, with the lowest level of spending on education occurring at primary level, which leaves schools operating on shoestring budgets and dependent on parental contributions and fundraising. While I welcome the addition of 100 new guidance counsellors for secondary schools, the total number of counsellors remains significantly less than it was before the 2012 cuts. What was needed was full restoration of the ex-quota guidance counsellor provision. The opportunity to do so has been missed. Children deserve equal access to this vital resource and the inequality will continue in the growing number of second level schools, with some having the resources to pay privately for a counsellor, while others with very vulnerable children will remain without this support. If we are to truly value all children equally, their well-being should be front and centre and all schools should be given the resources they need to support all children.  The Government and the largest Opposition party seemed very cosy and happy yesterday with the announcement of an additional €36.5 million for the higher education sector in 2017. The truth is that, despite the momentary feel good factor associated with the announcement, a sum of €36.5 million is totally inadequate and the direct result of the populist decision of the Government which felt compelled to give a little to as many people in the audience as possible. It is not only fully aware of the inadequacy of this additional funding but knowingly allowed it to happen because the Fine Gael manifesto in this year’s general election clearly stated the higher education sector needed €100 million just to stand still. The Government is sitting back and paying mere lip service by throwing a patently grossly inadequate sum at the higher education sector. It will do little to tackle the effects of successive cutbacks which have had a devastating impact on students, lecturers and the position of Irish educational institutions in international rankings.  The budget lacks a strategic vision. It is a most alarming and worrying blast from the past in playing primarily to developers through the help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers which will serve to fuel demand but, crucially, not tackle head-on the need to increase housing supply.It will fuel the property bubble, proving that lessons have not been learned from the past. The Government may claim this is the first budget in several years to address climate change, but it does so with zero innovation, zero ambition, no new initiatives, no funding for any new major public transport projects and no mention of investment in walking or cycling. There is nothing new, it is the same old politics. Time will show that after one strips bare this budget, putting to one side a couple of headline-grabbing initiatives which one could not but welcome, people will see it for what it is. It is a masterclass in Government self-survival and ironically, at the same time, it is skilfully keeping the party of purported main opposition and its reputation safe, for now at least. In the political environs in which this Government and Fianna Fáil operate, they can now take off their bulletproof jackets. It is a job well done. There were no political casualties and no political party humbled or embarrassed. However, the preoccupation, the near obsession and the distraction of putting themselves before what is best for this country is an entirely different matter. If it continues, it will explode any genuine attempt at new politics and it is something the people will clearly see through.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have just left the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills where we had quite the discussion on an issue relevant to the Minister and to many junior cycle students and their parents as we near the end of the first term of the school year, which is the worry and uncertainty about the distinct possibility that because of the Government's ongoing dispute with the ASTI, thousands of students will automatically lose marks in their English examination next summer. Two weeks ago before the same committee, the Minister said he could not guarantee that students taught by ASTI teachers would not lose out on 10% of their English grade if the dispute affects their ability to participate in classroom-based assessments. As it stands, we have no confirmation from him that every junior certificate student will be assessed equally and awarded an equal grade for equal quality of work, regardless of the union to which their English teacher belongs, and this is simply not good enough. Alternative models are in operation, which could help solve this problem and provide a guarantee to students that they will not be adversely affected. For example, students who do not participate in oral examinations in junior cycle languages have their written examinations marked out of 100. This means students who do not take an oral component in a language examination do not automatically lose marks. This, or another model, may not be ideal but I ask the Minister to accept the urgent need to have a contingency plan in place. Such a plan requires a great deal of preparation. Will the Minister outline the steps he is taking to make sure these students do not suffer because of a dispute that does not involve them? The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred in his budget contribution to fairness and said we are on a pathway to a just and fair society. He said fairness is about investment in education and education is the bedrock of our society. He spoke about access to education and how it has transformed our society and he is right. As John F. Kennedy said, education should be the greatest equaliser of them all. However, for all the Minister's talk of fairness, it is essential that we realise that the most important investment is in our children and in our students and that fairness means we must, first and foremost, make sure they are all treated equally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In putting the question to the Minister, I was not asking him to defend the reform but to help the students and guarantee that they will not lose out on 10% of their marks in English. I hope the Minister can lead, prioritise, instil and inject a real sense of pressing urgency into the ongoing negotiations and that all involved will redouble their efforts to resolve the dispute but the possibility of negotiations failing necessitates having a plan B. The Government has a duty to the students and to the welfare of our young people to show foresight and see the consequences that might flow from its actions. It cannot flail from crisis to crisis without trying to anticipate the events it is putting in motion. The bottom line is that there is an ongoing dispute with the ASTI, which means junior certificate students are going to suffer. The Minister must find a way to level the playing field for these children. Next June, third year students will face their first State examination and no students should have to face that exam, to walk into the examination hall, knowing that before they put pen to paper, they are 10% down on their results through no fault of their own. The Minister for Education should not let that happen.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am advocating for children.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister needs a plan B.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Say that to the students, Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am taking four and a half minutes and Deputy Healy is taking three minutes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	For the past six years the education system in this country has been slowly strangled. It has been called a managed decline by some of those presiding over it. Education is fundamental to the progress of any country. It allows us to innovate, will attract businesses, encourage job creation and enhance our reputation globally. As the Labour Party motion has rightly identified, budget 2017 showed little vision when it comes to education. It let our young people down. Is é an réalachas ná gur ligeadh sios ár ndaoine óga agus rinneadh neamhaird ar riachtanais ár ndaoine óga chomh maith le riachtanais ár muinteoirí óga. Where was the vision needed to address key issues of concern in our education system? Primary school classes in Ireland are the second most overcrowded in the European Union, but the Government has decided to leave them as they are. The Government did not commit to multiannual increases to school capitation grants even though many of our schools are currently operating on shoestring budgets and dependent on parental contributions and fund-raising. In respect of third level, how can our third level colleges continue to excel when they are neglected, starved of resources and ignored? Some of the colleges, despite their very best efforts, clearly cannot make ends meet. How can their leaders focus on what matters most, namely, the quality of education, when they are worried about paying the bills every month? Last week, the Government and the largest Opposition party seemed quite content with the announcement of an additional €36.5 million for the higher education sector in 2017. The truth is that it is totally inadequate. It will do little to tackle the effects of successive cutbacks which have had a devastating impact on students and lecturers. Regrettably, even though I commend the Labour Party on seeking to address key issues, I do not see any intention in this motion to address the huge inequality in the teaching profession. That is why the Green Party is proposing an amendment to this motion requesting the Government to commit immediately to a plan to eliminate all outstanding pay inequality for newly qualified teachers. Our young teachers play a vital role in the future direction of education. They are highly skilled and specialised classroom practitioners entrusted with huge and far reaching responsibility on a daily basis. By allowing the differential pay scales to continue, we are telling our teachers they do not matter and we do not care. It is difficult for a person who is blatantly and unjustifiably discriminated against on salary to continue to get up every morning, go into their place of employment and impart knowledge and positivity to the very best of their ability and also be a role model when at the same time they are being insulted and treated differently from some of their peers in the same place of work. This must stop. While I appreciate tough decisions were made in a time of crisis, the Government cut vital services without thought or consideration to the long-term consequences. These consequences are coming home to roost now in social welfare, health, justice and urgently in education. We need strategic vision. That vision needs to be clear and unequivocal. Crucially, the Government needs to bring those charged with delivering on that vision with it as respected partners and team players. The Government will only do so by treating them with basic fairness and respect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Green Party welcomes the Bill because, as a nation, we must have the courage to deal with this issue. Women should not have to steal away from their country to access a safe medical procedure and no woman’s life should ever be put in unnecessary danger. Ultimately, the Legislature must bear responsibility for the ongoing endangerment of the health and safety of women. On a number of occasions court judgments have, rightly, reminded us that it is our function to legislate. The courts have, correctly, signalled their unwillingness to fill the gap by doing the job of legislators. Tonight the Government is compounding that ongoing failure through its proposed amendment which will cause a further unnecessary delay. This latest delay, this intransigence and foot dragging put in peril the health and safety of more Irish women. We understand the work of the Citizens’ Assembly is ongoing and that it should be allowed to complete its work, but its job is not to legislate. That power lies exclusively with the Oireachtas. The Government’s amendment will paralyses that legislative function and, in so doing, once again deals a severe hammer blow to all those who had hoped 2016, in the era of so-called new mature politics, would offer real change. The truth is that the Government lacks the political courage to lead from the front on this issue and, in the absence of a willing Government, the Citizens' Assembly moves centre stage and suddenly represents women’s best pragmatic hope in the lifetime of the Thirty-second Dáil. The Green Party wishes the Citizens' Assembly well, but in the meantime this Oireachtas should never have its voice softened - it should be heard loud and clear. It is not right to expect Members of the Oireachtas to temporarily lose their voice, their resolve and their right to vote. It is because the voices of elected representatives in the past were not sufficiently loud, effective, just, coherent and steadfast that we are where we are today with some women’s lives continuing to be endangered. Sadly and ironically, it is as if the present is catching up with the dark and uncaring days of the past. Ireland can no longer pretend or indefinitely postpone and prevaricate. That is why the Green Party will be supporting the Bill because we believe a referendum is needed to repeal the eighth amendment as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With Deputy Shortall, yes. The Green Party broadly welcomes many aspects of the Bill before the House and commends the Minister and the previous Seanad on all the hard work they invested in it. We are particularly pleased to see the proposed new criminal offences to protect children against grooming, new measures to protect them from online predators, new and strengthened offences to tackle child pornography, harassment orders to protect victims of convicted sex offenders and new provisions to be introduced regarding evidence by victims, particularly children. The Green Party recognises the ambition to bring Irish law into line with a number of international legal instruments. However, we have serious reservations regarding Part 4 of the Bill, which deals with the purchase of sexual services. While we agree with the policy aim of reducing the levels of prostitution, we believe that this must not be done at the expense of increasing the safety risks or the health risks sex workers face. In the past ten years, organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations Population Fund and the well-known and esteemed medical journal, The Lancet, have all called for the full decriminalisation of sex work. While there are many different countries and approaches to learn from, what the Government is proposing is known as the Nordic model. This form of law usually involves the formal removal of criminal sanctions against sex workers and instead criminalises the buyer. What the Government is proposing is to criminalise the buyer and remove one of the criminal sanctions against solicitation but also to create a new solicitation crime and leave brothel keeping as a criminal act. The Nordic approach has received a significant level of criticism, particularly when it comes to the health and the safety of sex workers. From the point of view of the increased health risks stemming from the introduction of similar laws in other jurisdictions, I draw the Ministers' attention to the report from HIV Ireland, which states that schemes to promote harm reduction and lessen the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, STIs, by sex workers are basically incompatible with the Nordic law model. The report notes that when sex workers are arrested in Sweden under this law, the police use the fact that they have been carrying condoms as evidence. Similar concerns have been expressed in Canada. The Green Party is concerned that by criminalising the client, the more marginalised sex workers who continue to engage in prostitution will have to take on the burden of ensuring that the buyer of sex does not get arrested. The Vista Analysis report, which was undertaken for the Norwegian Government, indicates that sex workers were more likely to agree to go to the homes of clients following the introduction of the law there, thus lessening their control of situations and exposing them to increased risks. The same report indicated that following the introduction of the law, sex workers exhibited a higher tolerance for violence before they reported it to the police. We fear that the compromising of the relationship with the Garda that would result from this law poses a risk that sex workers, particularly the most marginalised, would not receive redress for crimes committed against them. Under the proposed law, sex workers are still penalised for working together in order to keep themselves safe. It has been shown that in other states, sex workers can also face difficulties in securing accommodation as their landlords can be prosecuted for letting premises to them. This can lead to forced evictions of sex workers from their homes. Significant questions remain about the Nordic model. The Green Party’s key concern with it is that a sufficient evaluation has not been carried out upfront to show whether the changes brought in had any impact on the health and well-being of sex workers. Stories are emerging of sex workers driven further underground and, therefore, out of safety in order to protect the identities of their clients. The latter means that they place themselves at even greater risk. The UK is currently revisiting its approach. The select Home Affairs Committee has said that the Home Office should immediately introduce legislation to allow for solicitation by sex workers and to change brothel-keeping laws to allow workers share premises so that they are safer. I know the legislation before us has been worked on since 2012 and I accept that everyone who has contributed has done so in absolute good faith and with an overarching desire to protect sex workers. However, I am concerned that we are rushing to enact it without full research and understanding in terms of identifying a baseline against which we can measure its success or otherwise. Most legislation requires an impact evaluation and consultation on the likely outcomes. That is what the UK is now seeking to do and we should consider doing something similar. Further, why does this proposed legislation not incorporate some element of a review mechanism to allow legislative reflection on its impact over a number of years? A similar provision is incorporated in the Gender Recognition Act 2015. It will be very difficult to make a judgment on the impact of the legislation when we have refused to undertake any prior evaluation of the existing situation. Sex workers are a vulnerable group. It is wrong of this House to undertake a major public policy change that will impact on them without carrying out prior research or giving real consideration to the impact of similar changes in other countries. The crucial question we need to ask is how to reduce the number of people involved in sex work but in a way that does not risk the health or safety of existing sex workers. The Green Party believes that the existing research does not at this stage sufficiently validate the Nordic model for us to believe it is the right choice for Ireland. We call on the Minister, therefore, to initiate a comprehensive baseline study on the practice of prostitution in Ireland. Such a study should be undertaken from a human rights perspective, considering the welfare of sex workers, the reason people enter the industry, the barriers to leaving and their experiences while in sex work. We also need to have a proper understanding of the current numbers of people working as sex workers.In conclusion, the Green Party welcomes the bulk of the measures in this Bill. It contains many provisions which are excellent and we commend those involved to date on its thoroughness and its intention. However, we believe Part 4 will present a problem for the health and safety of sex workers, and reluctantly, we will be abstaining on Second Stage with a view to tabling an amendment to this on Committee and Report Stages to remove Part 4 which will allow us to support the Bill in the future. If not removed at that Stage, we will have no choice but to oppose the Bill on Final Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	For many years, we saw our bogs as a resource to be exploited. We did not understand their value as natural and archaeological heritage, flood regulators and carbon sinks protecting our climate. We were not unique. Most European countries have damaged most of their peatlands. Some, such as the Netherlands, have gone from having enormous expanses of peatland to having almost no bogs left. Most other European countries long ago recognised the value of their bogs. The Dutch regret the loss of their bogs to such an extent that they established an organisation in the 1980s to help conserve Irish bogs and have provided funding to buy and protect bogs in Ireland. Across Europe and the planet, countries are committing to the protection of their peatlands and the rewetting and restoration of large areas of peat. Unfortunately, the Government is not listening to the scientific and economic advice that is leading other countries to reverse the process of peatland and wetland loss. In Ireland, the scientific foundation for a new approach to our bogs was set out in a major project funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA - and based at UCD - Bogland: Sustainable Management of Peatlands in Ireland, which reported in 2011. The academics who produced the study pointed out that policies for the management of peatland in Ireland are led, not by the public good or the national interest but by single interest groups often against their own long-term interests. Despite recommendations in the report, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, continues to be chronically underfunded. This is demonstrated by the fact that the review of the raised bog natural heritage area network, to which the Bill refers, had to be outsourced to private sector consultants. There is still no meaningful outreach programme to build public awareness and understanding. NGOs such the Irish Peatland Conservation Council and An Taisce do what they can, but it can never be a substitute for a properly funded public awareness campaign. Communities located near protected bogs, such as Clara bog and other raised bogs which have become tourism resources, have had the chance to see the economic value of protected boglands as well as the amenity value. Abbeyleix bog, which was saved from Bord na Móna by a concerted local campaign, is another example of a community gaining a wider value from its local bog. I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, that Bord na Móna lands near Athlone will be allowed to flood as part of the recently announced flood alleviation scheme for the town. However, the fact remains that peat extraction, on a large or small scale, is no longer economical. On a large scale, electricity customers pay a subsidy to ensure three peat fired power plants continue to operate, despite the fact that they produce more expensive electricity and bodies such as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, continually advise that the subsidy should be discontinued. On a small scale, the use of turf for domestic heating is inefficient combustion in thermally inefficient houses. It is at considerable expense, leaving many families worse off or even in fuel poverty. During the past five years, NGOs have repeatedly requested that compensation for the end of turf cutting in special areas of conservation and national heritage areas should be integrated with funding from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to bring houses up to a higher standard of efficiency, comfort and health. However, it seems the different Departments do not want to work in tandem. Both Bord na Móna and the private contractors which cut turf want to keep doing what they are doing. It is not about what is best for the economy, climate, lands downstream or our threatened wildlife. The Ministers and Departments, which should take the big picture view, cannot see past this narrow sectional interest. Therefore, we have the ridiculous circumstance of sending our officials back and forth to Brussels to ensure we are allowed to keep burning our heritage and deal with the fact that we are not complying with EU laws. These are laws which we helped to write, to which we signed up and which we then failed to implement. This brings us to the small further step in the destruction of our natural heritage contained in the Bill. In 1999, when Ireland was seen to fail to comply with EU law on the environment impact assessment of peat extraction, the European Commission brought us before the European Court of Justice. In that case, C-392/96, the court found Ireland in breach of EU law on environmental impact assessment and stated that its actions on peat extraction resulted in the "unremitting loss of areas of bog of nature conservation importance". Incredibly, since the 1999 ruling, great expanses of peat continue to be extracted in the absence of environmental impact assessment. Much large-scale peat extraction occurs with no planning permission, as demonstrated by analysis of satellite imagery by UCC that was commissioned by Friends of the Irish Environment with funding from the Department. Despite the fact that this unauthorised activity can be seen from space, no planning enforcement action has been undertaken. To return the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in 1999, in order to comply with the ruling, Ireland had to agree changes with the European Commission. This included changing the thresholds for environmental impact assessment of peat extraction and the undertaking of an intensive programme to designate raised and blanket bogs as natural heritage areas. This led to the designation of 75 bogs as natural heritage areas. Nevertheless, in 2016 we have a special Bill put before us by this Government specifically to enable the Minister to de-designate 46 of these 75 bogs. That beggars belief. Why does the Minister refuse to protect our peatlands? In addition to their obvious biodiversity value, peatlands are also very important carbon sinks. Globally, peatlands store an equivalent of 75% of the total amount of atmospheric carbon. Our bogs also act like sponges, helping to protect us from flooding. After many recent catastrophic floods in this country, does this Government get how vital it is to take preventative action and not the exact opposite? Draining and harvesting our bogs prevents them from effectively carrying out this vital natural function. Cutting up our bogs has resulted in silting river beds and lakes, as we have seen with Lough Derg on the Shannon system. Worse still, when drained and harvested, these bogs go from being carbon sinks to being very large sources of carbon, as the cutting process dries out the bog, allowing the remaining peat to oxidise and release CO2. This is why we need to protect our peatlands. If we are going to have any real chance of preventing climate change, we must keep every ounce of carbon in the ground. As a country we should be world leaders in the conservation of our bogs but there is no leadership in this Bill. It chooses to destroy rather than protect. The Minister may dress the Bill up in whatever way she wishes. To the Green Party and many others, however, it is nothing more than a shameful destruction of our heritage. It will lead to the destruction of part of our past while simultaneously placing little or no value on our future.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the members of the Irish deaf community, the interpreters and all those who have worked so hard and for so long on the Irish Sign Language recognition campaign who are present in the Visitors Gallery. I commend Senator Mark Daly for introducing the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 which I welcome, with the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in recognition of and out of respect for the basic right to communicate of the more than 5,000 members of the Irish deaf community. They are important steps we need to take as a country. In 2015, while I was a member of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I tabled a motion that received unanimous support and which called on the Government to give recognition to Irish Sign Language. It is a privilege for me to stand in this House and welcome the report which seeks to make it a reality. Irish Sign Language gives thousands of Irish people the invaluable gift of communication. The deaf community feels isolated and cut off from access to information. The Irish Deaf Society has been campaigning for more than 30 years to have Irish Sign Language officially recognised so as to ensure equality for deaf people in society who simply want to secure their right to full participation as citizens. It is essential that public bodies be required to provide the necessary interpretative services for deaf people. I welcome the measures that seek to do this which are included in the report and the Bill. Not even for one moment can I attempt to contemplate how frustrating it must be for a person who is deaf to have to engage with a public body. Simple acts of daily life that we take for granted such as contacting a local authority or departmental office become increasingly frustrating for those who are deaf because there is no one on the other side of the counter who can interpret or communicate with them. The Irish Deaf Society has stated the failure to recognise Irish Sign Language places at risk the health and well-being of deaf people, as they often struggle to avail of vital health and educational services. Many public and private services taken for granted by others are inaccessible to deaf people. Availability of services and information in Irish Sign Language as guaranteed by law is the only means of ensuring deaf people will have the opportunity to access and participate fully in society. The Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016 seeks to ensure members of the deaf community will be able to participate fully as citizens of the country by legally guaranteeing their right to access information in what is their first and, for many, only language. The Green Party-Comhaontas Glas is happy to support the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is the third time since my election to Dáil Éireann last February that we have discussed mental health in this Chamber. Despite the Government's commitments to implement A Vision for Change, it refuses to lead effectively from the front, refuses to implement real and positive changes to our mental health services and refuses to prioritise the mental wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens. By reneging on its commitment to invest appropriately in our mental health services, this Government has signalled its contempt for the human rights of those with mental health symptoms. It confirms in the minds of the many shattered families that their agonising wait for appropriate interventions and supports for their loved ones will be a weight that will continue under this Minister's watch. Tragically for some, this weight has and will continue to prove fatal. It copperfastens the sense of hopelessness that they have become accustomed to since A Vision for Change was launched. It is a blueprint document full of vision that has been accompanied by a snail's pace of change. It is an excellent document and it does not need review but full implementation. According to research, those who suffer from mental illness need a sustained sense of hope. However, this Government feeds them with hopelessness. Even more inexcusably, this Government promised a false dawn and an increase of €35 million in the recent budget to respond to their needs. However, within days of the budget, the harsh truth emerged that a significant proportion of the promised funding would not be allocated in 2017. This Government has yet again pressed the pause button on the recovery of thousands of its citizens. The message is very clear for those who, because of their symptoms, cannot rise and be heard and for those who, with enduring mental illness who sometimes cannot advocate for themselves, will be pushed aside as this Government balances its books. The brilliant poet, singer and songwriter, the late Leonard Cohen, is on record sharing the sheer debilitating impact that mental illness, in his case, depression, had on his own life. He famously wrote, "There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in". To those desperately awaiting therapy and support, it must feel as though every crack has been filled in and light might never break through. Further delays should not and cannot be countenanced. No more reviews and no more false dawns. There is a need to instil a proper sense of extreme urgency in order, for once and for all, to tackle one of the most critically important challenges of our time. Where there is a will, there is a way. However, the Government must prioritise, invest, inject hope and deliver appropriate supports and real solutions, translating words into tangible hope and delivering a real, effective, coherent and sustainable response.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Green Party will support this Bill because it proposes some positive steps forward in ensuring equality of access, participation and opportunity in schools. However, while what is proposed in this Bill is clearly preferable to the current prevailing system, it simply does not go far enough. This was a golden opportunity to remove finally the baptism barrier from the schools admission process to ensure no child is discriminated against because of his or her religion. Why has the Minister not incorporated the removal of this discriminatory barrier in the Bill? Such barriers have no place in education as equality must be central in any educational reform. Proper and fair access to education is a cornerstone of equality. Therefore, although the Green Party will support this Bill, I will table amendments on Committee Stage to address the baptism barrier that the Government simply refuses to address. Schools should reflect the modern diversity of families and communities. No State-funded school should be able to discriminate for or against a child on the basis of his or her religion. While there is a place for freedom of religion and religious schools, this should be recognised and respected, but not in an exclusive way. Taxpayers’ money should not fund discrimination. While I welcome the provision in this Bill whereby schools will have to publish their procedures for working with children who do not wish to partake in religious instruction classes, it is essential that the Department of Education and Skills goes further and provides guidelines to schools and accessible options for children who will opt out of religious classes, spelling out and committing to access for these children to appropriate alternatives to such classes. The events of recent days, weeks and months have surely shown us that our children are growing up in very worrying times. We have the challenges of climate change, the rise of the far right and populists preaching intolerance and hate for those who are "other" - other nationalities, other races, other genders, other sexual orientations and other religions. Anyone who has spoken to a young child knows that children simply do not see these differences or these so-called others. Where they do notice a difference, it is to be explored, to be gazed on in wonder and to be celebrated. Put simply, we have an obligation to challenge hate and fear of those different from ourselves. We must defeat exclusion and alienation with inclusivity in everything we do, including how we educate our children.The most valuable lessons any child can learn are respect, tolerance and love for all the people around him or her, regardless of their ethnicity, age, religion, the language they speak or where they are from. We as legislators must do all in our power to protect children from becoming isolated and insulated. I am concerned that we are falling short of doing what we can and as a result we deprive children of the rich lasting experience of encountering children who come from different backgrounds, cultures, points of view and ways of life or religious beliefs. Apart from the long-term benefits of helping to create a more stable, tolerant enriched society a child who cannot interact with the wonderful diversity of this country and the world to the fullest possible extent is a child whose childhood is not as rich as it should be. Schools are where children make friends, and often where their parents make friends also. While the religious ethos of many schools is helping to shape the good values of the people of this country, no child should be denied a possible friend because he or she prays in a different way, or he or she does not pray at all. That said, I acknowledge the contribution made by religious orders to education over hundreds of years. Many of us here in the Chamber owe our education to the religious orders. They were often the only educators who were playing an invaluable role at home and abroad. So many of them are rightly renowned throughout the world. In the past, they provided education in a voluntary capacity, and at times at grave risk to their own lives. We can acknowledge that and show our appreciation while at the same time we prepare to step forward into a new era, a new Ireland which is a changing society where all children must be embraced and treated equally. The demand for non-denominational schools in Ireland is surely an indication that many parents seek a more secular and pluralist education for their children. Parents should be allowed make that choice and children should be allowed to benefit from it. This Bill also takes some steps towards removing barriers for children with special educational needs, but I respectfully suggest that, again, it does not go far enough and to that end I intend tabling amendments on Committee Stage. At a recent education committee briefing with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, I noted that many schools do not open classes for children with autism despite a local need being identified. I believe the Bill should have a provision whereby the NCSE would have the power to instruct a school to do so. That would, of course, be in cases where a school has the physical space to allow for that. The NCSE could then provide the appropriate resources. That would prevent the current situation where parents are stressed and frantically trying to find appropriate schools, making numerous applications, being refused and having to go through numerous appeals. I have met many such parents while canvassing the area of Dublin Rathdown and their stress, hurt and sometimes exhaustion was palpable. It is something I will keep with me and I propose that we as legislators should not allow that to continue. Simple measures to address the issue in the Bill would relieve massive burdens from those parents. We must acknowledge, embrace and cater for a changing, modern society in which all children are treated equally when it comes to education. Religious discrimination has no place in modern society. All schools in receipt of State funding should be fair, transparent and inclusive in their admissions policies and discrimination on the basis of religion or special educational need should never be tolerated. Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is cúis áthais dom é an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair an Tí uasail seo inniu. Is é sin go mbeadh toghchán i gceist le haghaidh ról Ard-Mhéara na cathrach seo, príomhchathair na hÉireann. Léiríonn an Bille seo freisin na cumhachtaí a bheadh ag an Ard-Mhéara agus na hearnálacha agus grúpaí lena mbeadh sé nó sí ag obair. Is léir don phobal le blianta beaga anuas go bhfuil forbairt as cuimse tar éis teacht ar chathracha na tíre, ach go háirithe ar an bpríomhchathair, Baile Átha Cliath. Caithfear ceannaireacht chuí a bheith ar fáil do Bhaile Átha Cliath chun freastal ar an réimse leathan fadhbanna atá le sárú againn sa phríomhchathair, mar shampla, cúrsaí tithíochta, cúrsaí tráchta agus daoine gan dídean, dar ndóigh. Níl ról an Ard-Mhéara in oiriúint don phobal a thuilleadh maidir le riachtanais mhuintir na cathrach seo. Conas gur féidir le hArd-Mhéara ar bith aon dul chun cinn fad-téarmach a chur i gcrích más rud é nach bhfuil sa téarma ach bliain amháin agus gan aon chumhacht acu difríocht dhearfach a dhéanamh? Tá sé criticiúil go mbeadh an deis ag Ard-Mhéara fís spreagúil a léiriú agus go dtabharfaí tréimhse chuí agus cumhacht don duine sin tionscnamh substainteach a stiúradh. Táimid ag caint faoi ról ceannródaíochta anseo. Agus cá bhfios, leis an duine ceart tofa, an méid forbairt a bheadh le feiceáil le ceannaireacht chróga chumasach? Seans go mbeadh Gaillimh, Luimneach, Port Láirge agus Corcaigh in ann a mhacasamhail a dhéanamh in am trátha sa todhchaí. For many years, a long-standing policy position of the Green Party has been the need for and the clear benefits of a directly elected mayor for all major cities in Ireland starting with Dublin. A directly elected mayor freed from party politics and the grip of senior council officials can deliver for Dublin. Council officials have a role to play but it should not be the lead role as they have no democratic mandate and, therefore, are in no way truly accountable to the people. We need one elected individual - a readily identifiable and recognisable individual who will be the face of Dublin. We want to put a "face to a place".  This is a simple and easy way to deliver political accountability. It involves a person who will represent all of Dublin both at home and on the international stage and stand up for Dublin - a person whose sole job is to put his or her citizens first and be the focal point to drive the development and progress of the city, support its people, look out for opportunities, protect the city and its citizens against challenges and steward this city towards a long-term sustainable vision. A directly elected mayor should be a visionary leader, an ambassador who can lead their city, attracting long-term and sustainable investment and jobs. There is no reason we cannot have a mayor for Dublin followed by a mayor for Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny. However, it makes sense to start with Dublin where a directly elected mayor would have a mandate from over a quarter of the State's population. The C40 global initiative is led by mayors from over 40 world cities who are developing strategies for how each of their cities can lead the way in preventing and staving off the negative consequences of climate change. A huge number of European cities are at the table but, unfortunately, Dublin is not. Dublin is not competing with Limerick, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny or Waterford. It is competing with London, Hamburg, Warsaw and Barcelona. We need to find new ways to make Dublin and our cities places that are attractive to invest in and more satisfying for people to live in. We need to be pioneering different and innovative approaches for our cities, all built around the challenges we face.  If we look to the UK, we see that Manchester is focusing on the promotion of business creation. Sunderland is the first English city to use cloud technology to offer broadband service everywhere. Leeds has developed the concept of "civic enterprise" that mobilises public assets in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors to create innovative responses to public need, for example, the need for sustainable energy. Bristol is working to create a new social model which will enable its citizens and social institutions to create a non-state vehicle for social investment.  It is no coincidence that cities that seem to be adapting to social and technological change are cities like Chicago that are led by strong mayors like Rahm Emmanuel. Much can be learned from cities like Chicago and New York, not just about policy but also about leadership. It is striking how mayors like Michael Bloomberg and Rahm Emmanuel embody their cities without getting trapped in parochialism. They have an outward-looking, entrepreneurial focus that makes them ambitious for their cities, as well as being attuned to what makes their places special. For example, the transformation of New York's Times Square has had a hugely positive impact way beyond Manhattan and shows what can be done. We cannot change mayors every 12 months and expect coherent and effective leadership. Some longevity and continuity is vital. Sticking with the current annual ritual where political horse trading decides who gets to wear the ceremonial mayoral chain for the following year does not serve the best interest of the citizens. Our cities need real, transparent and accountable leadership and that means the office of mayor cannot remain a ceremonial role. The new role must have day-to-day executive powers and be given some real input into improving the quality of daily life of Dubliners. It needs to be not only their unified voice expressing their concerns but be empowered to resolve, for example, the escalating transport and safety challenges that cyclists, motorists and pedestrians face, to promote Dublin tourism on the world stage and to foster and promote the arts and literature. Dublin is uniquely placed to do much more to utilise its world-renowned standing in the world of arts and literature. It is time we got the development of urban Ireland right and directly elected women and men with the vision to take on that task.We want to give every Dubliner a vote in 2019 for a directly elected mayor. We must allow Dubliners to take greater ownership of their city, entrust the people of Dublin and give them a real say and ensure all avenues to have a better Dublin will always be fully explored and utilised. This is a real opportunity to do that. The idea of having a directly elected mayor has been talked about and investigated for almost 20 years. In those years it has received the support of many political parties and Independents. It is time for action.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ba mhaith liom a rá don Teach seo anocht go bhfuil an Comhaontas Glas fíor-shásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. I commend Deputy Kenny on bringing this Bill before the House, which I will support. The Green Party has long called for appropriate legislation to decriminalise the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, and our recent submission to the national drugs strategy supports this position. As long as the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes remains illegal, our citizens, many in agonising pain, remain at the mercy of dealers and this secret world for people suffering pain is unsupervised and unregulated, with no safe or reliable expert advice. If charged and convicted in the criminal courts of justice, they currently face a fine of up to €2,750 and a 12-month prison sentence for a third offence. A recent all-party parliamentary group in the United Kingdom has called for legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use. They heard many compelling stories of the dramatic improvements to their health that some cannabis users have experienced. An expert review feeding into this group’s work found good evidence that cannabis oil can help with chronic pain, muscle spasms often associated with multiple sclerosis, and the management of anxiety, nausea and vomiting, particularly when caused as a side effect of chemotherapy. Here in Ireland we have heard from people like the brave and inspiring Vera Twomey who is doing everything she can to advocate for her little girl, Ava, who has Dravet syndrome and is subject to ever-increasing seizures. Last year, after 18 consecutive seizures in close succession, Ava suffered an especially severe seizure and after trying every medication available, doctors eventually were running out of options. That is when Vera turned to cannabis oil as her last hope. She has said that her daughter’s quality of life has been transformed since then. It is difficult to put a number on the many people who are using medicinal cannabis in Ireland, but considering the number of people who have epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis or any other brain or muscle related condition, there are probably thousands in agonising pain who are hoping against hope that we, as legislators, will speak up and act for them tonight. These people need practical support, translating words, however genuine, into doing our utmost to take action. They deserve our compassion and support, not potential criminal records or a lifetime of pain.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In light of the recent High Court judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Barrett in AIB v. Counihan on 21 December 2016 as well as in the light of the serious concerns expressed recently by the Master of the High Court, what assurances can the Minister for Justice and Equality give to families facing the repossession of their homes that she has done all in her power to protect them properly? Can she assure people unambiguously that all persons with decision-making responsibility of such magnitude are fully informed of the very latest legal developments and properly trained in respect of their legal obligations under EU law? Will she assure the many hard-pressed borrowers who are often referred to as the forgotten, the so-called squeezed middle who never got any bailout, that the terms of the directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts will be applied in repossession proceedings for family homes in every appropriate case? In light of the expressed concerns of the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, about what is reportedly and unlawfully happening, will the Minister consider taking appropriate steps to place a moratorium on all such proceedings until she is satisfied that EU law is being applied consistently throughout the State? Is the Minister confident that all county registrars have the necessary legal training to apply EU law in home repossession cases? The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that where a consumer contract comes before a court, the court must satisfy itself that none of its terms is unfair, even when the consumer has not called upon it to do so. As a mortgage contract is a consumer contract where the property is a home, it is vital that county registrars, who in reality deal with the majority of repossession applications, are fully aware of the implications of these decisions. The Master of the High Court is of the opinion, however, that county registrars should not be dealing with these repossession cases at all. There is a real and justifiable concern that many repossession orders granted in the Circuit Court may be open to challenge as EU law was not applied. In such a scenario and leaving aside the lenders, it is the State that could conceivably be found liable. There is a potential financial risk for the State. Considering the inequality of arms between the thousands of ordinary, hard-working and decent borrowers on one side and lenders on the other side with bottomless funds, will the Minister assure families that the full range of protections available to persons are being implemented? When homeowners are summonsed to appear before the courts, however reluctant or daunting that may be, they must at the very least be assured that decision-makers are fully resourced, updated and upskilled in all aspects of protections, including the very latest, available to those facing home repossession. For the administration of justice to operate most effectively in our country, it must enjoy the complete confidence of all the people. It is of concern that the Master of the High Court does not have that confidence.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am glad to hear that this matter is under consideration, but justice delayed is justice denied. In some cases, delays are fatally dangerous because it is already too late and the clock can never be put back. For many others, time is of the essence. I have asked a specific question, namely, whether the Government is satisfied that family homeowners who are doing their utmost to simply survive from day-to-day and week-to-week and are now facing a legal process and the prospect of potentially losing their homes will be given as much protection as is feasibly possible. If the answer is "Yes", can the Minister of State explain how he came to that conclusion? The master of the High Court has expressed his concern that the Government is failing to properly protect people facing home repossessions, claiming that current procedures do not ensure EU consumer legislation is being applied. At least one county registrar has stopped processing such cases. Is the master, Mr. Honohan, right or wrong? The Green Party and many others believe the Government needs to address his genuine and serious concerns. County registrars are effectively agents of the European Union. There is an obligation on them to examine contracts to determine whether they are fair. Does the Minister of State agree with the master of the High Court that the rules and procedures of these courts need to be updated to facilitate a hearing in every single repossession case with regard to EU legislation and unfair contract terms? The law provides that a term which allows the commercial party to unilaterally change the contract is defined as unfair. What about the banks that arbitrarily increased interest rates, beggaring those with variable rate mortgages? What about those who were falsely sold interest-only mortgages and then had their loans switched to capital and interest loans just as the recession began to bite? The Government should introduce a moratorium on all home repossessions until assurances can be given that adequate resources are in place to fulfil the legal obligations under EU law and legal clarity is restored in order that the Government can give assurances to all home owners facing home repossessions that the full range of protections available to them are being applied.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíor-shásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. Caithfear gníomhú láithreach chun a chinntiú nach rachaidh fadhb na ndaoine gan dídean in olcas agus chun a chinntiú nach mbeidh ar aon chlann eile a teach a fhágail. The Green Party welcomes the Bill and will be supporting it. We have all seen the pain and misery caused by such family upheaval as a result of people having to leave their homes due to rent increases, the property owner wishing to turn over the property or, in some cases, the sale of the property as a distressed asset and the vulture fund owners, to use their own parlance, sweating that asset. The Bill largely follows recommendations made by Threshold when it addressed the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness in May 2016. Threshold recommended increasing security of tenure for tenants, providing for rent certainty, establishing legal safeguards to allow tenants to remain after the sale of a property, amending the legal definition of a landlord to include receivers and lenders in possession, and introducing a code of conduct on buy-to-let mortgage arrears. The Bill provides for this. According to Focus Ireland, repossessions are resulting in between 60 and 80 families a month becoming homeless. The latest Central Bank statistics indicate that approximately 80,000 private home mortgages are in arrears. Of these, almost 35,000 are in arrears more than 720 days. These statistics indicate that the unprecedented crisis of homelessness in the country could get much worse. The Bill plans ahead by putting in place measures to protect families at risk of being made homeless. The Bill seeks security of tenure. We are often told that there are rules governing the operation of an economy that cannot be tampered with and that consequences will ensue. This is not true. The rules are changed all the time. In our economy and society the rule seems to be that humans are expendable. We now need to start to rewrite the rules and the first and overarching rule is that people matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This week, individual citizens and families in my constituency have become the latest innocent victims of being forced to face the fallout, living nightmare and financial upset of learning that their dream homes have been severely blighted by inept, incompetent, greed-driven building standards that were not properly regulated by the State. There is a duty on Government to protect its people against incompetent rogue cowboy builders. This duty extends to tidying up, once and for all, the mess and the shoddy workmanship that is allowed to go on unchecked and unregulated. Despite numerous reported debacles since Priory Hall, this Government has still not acted to secure a remedy for people whose homes have been proven to have been built in a defective way. Where is the remedy? What redress and tangible support do these hardworking people have when they discover major defects in their homes? In many cases, the builders and developers have gone bust. However, our forgiving corporate insolvency laws allow them to return to the workforce. They are given a second chance and a fresh start, but the individual citizens who do not enjoy the protection of the corporate veil are abandoned. There are still no adequate statutory remedy or supports in place for many people who find themselves in this situation. There is lots of talk but no concrete action for thousands of people who are enduring this living hell. Will the Taoiseach undertake a review of the causes of housing failures that have come to light in recent years? Will he set out a strategy for dealing with housing defects to include statutory protection for home buyers supported by comprehensive mandatory defects insurance for all dwellings? Will he please explain to the House why the only law reform in this area introduced since Priory Hall is changes to building control, with zero new remedies for consumers, no regulatory body for contractors and no dispute resolution scheme for the people of this country when defects emerge in their homes?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I appreciate the Taoiseach's recognition that we need a supervisory authority, the fact is local authority building control is greatly underfunded. In many cases claims against builders are statute barred because defects were not noticed by home owners in the legally stipulated period and there are still no solutions for people whose homes were built pre-2014. The huge legislative gap which exists in this area more than five years after Priory Hall is staggering. How many times must this issue rear its ugly head before the people who are affected by it have some level of certainty about the relief they can seek? Are they forever to be reliant on a Government which acts in an ad hoc wait-to-see manner? These are people's homes and it should be a `Government priority that if anything happens to people’s homes, they should not be left in limbo. The Government’s housing plan is called Rebuilding Ireland. Let us make sure we do it right this time. The Taoiseach should initiate a review of previous housing failures and ensure home owners have somewhere to turn for relief from the mistakes of developers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Maidir leis na fíricí a nochtadh ar RTE ar an Luan, caithfear a rá go bhfuil córas sláinte na tíre seo ina chíor thuathail amach is amach. Ba chóir go mbeadh bainisteoirí an chórais ag deimhniú nach bhfuil aon othar ag fulaingt, ach a mhalairt atá fíor mar go bhfuil an córas beag beann ar fhualaingt an othair. Monday's "RTE Investigates" served as a harsh reminder of what we have known for so long: our health system is broken and remains broken. The problem is that not only the present Government but consecutive Governments continue to be reactive to problems by responding in a short-term way to the latest serious inadequacy, acting like a fire-fighting service endeavouring and struggling at times to put out the latest fire. What we need and what the people are crying out for is a more strategic approach that tackles effectively and permanently, for once and for all, huge inadequacies, gross managerial inefficiencies and glaring inequalities in access to services. The Government must work to strengthen the public health system to ensure it is sustainable into the future. This requires a radical new approach. Funding for primary and community care must be increased in order that acute hospital beds are kept for those with the most serious clinical needs. We need to increase rapidly the number of general practitioners, public health nurses and advanced nurse practitioners. I acknowledge this will require incentivisation as otherwise, many gifted nurses and doctors will continue to vote with their feet and turn to other counties for better job opportunities that incorporate a much better quality of work life. For too long they have been told they are doing a heroic job but at this stage, medical practitioners practising on the daily front line want more than our words. They want and deserve a managerial solution and the greatest tribute and meaningful gratitude one can pay the stakeholders is to deliver for them and for the patients real, competent, visionary management and to overhaul the system. All the best international evidence tells us that a universal health care system is the most cost-effective model and it is that which we should move towards. Yes, delivering a proper, fair and efficient service may mean less or no tax reductions, at least in the short term, but that honest conversation must take place. If done fairly, taxpayers will recognise the need to prioritise improving such essential services over gimmicky tax breaks which are often born as meaningless pre-election promises. The public has a role in this regard, and one such role is to recognise cynical pre-election auction politics for what it is. It is the enemy of effectively overhauling and delivering a wide range of public services desperately needed in this country.We need absolute transparency and accountability in our health system. To begin with, fundamentally, the people deserve to know the truth. We need to be provided with an honest and accurate picture of the state of our public health services. There must be detailed analysis and breakdowns of current and future expenditure and information, justifying how funding decisions are made. Individuals who fail to deliver must be held accountable. That is what happens in a normal business but I challenge the Minister to name one person who has ever been held truly accountable for this ongoing saga, which tragically has real victims. Only in the past week Dr. Fergal Hickey warned us that up to 350 patients will die as a result of capacity constraints in intensive care units in our hospitals. Is é bun agus barr an scéil na nach féidir linn brath ar an gcóras seo againne chun freastal orainn. Access to health care should not be a paid extra for some. Health is not an entitlement. It is a basic and fundamental right.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Considering the grave extent of incompetencies and mistakes made to date by Tusla, can the Minister, Deputy Zappone, confirm whether or not similar mistakes of this magnitude have been made by Tusla, and whether or not Tusla made this mistake in respect of any other members of An Garda Síochána, or persons who are not members of the force? Is this an isolated incident? Or have other individuals - be they members of An Garda Síochána or not - been adversely affected by such appalling false allegations? If there are other cases, what supports can be given to these individuals and their families? Apart from the investigation that the Minister announced yesterday, what immediate steps have been taken to safeguard against this ever happening again? Surely there is no need to have to wait for the findings of an investigation or inquiry to assure the public that immediate steps are in train to ensure that this never recurs.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A commitment was made in the programme for Government to review the closure of Garda stations, and as part of the review there is a clear commitment to launch a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, and it states this would be initiated within two months. That was ten months ago.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Since the closure in my constituency of Stepaside Garda station in 2012 the community lives in constant fear, with some residents having been the victims of burglary not just once or twice, but on three occasions. The community is living in hope its station will be identified as one of the six to be reopened. This is why over the past year I have submitted a number of questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality, the most recent being last week, seeking clarity as to when the six stations will be identified, but there is still no clarity or no date given. In the Minister's most recent reply to me last week, she stated she has not received a report on any aspect of this matter from the Garda authorities. Frankly, this admission from the Minister is unacceptable. I ask the Taoiseach to seek this report and shed some light on when the announcement will be made and demand an explanation for the delay and paralysis. At the very least, will he insist on a definite timeline for same?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ba mhaith lion a rá leis an Teach anocht go bhfuil an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. Once again in this House, we find ourselves discussing the need to repeal an uncompromising, extremely rigid Article in the Constitution which has caused untold unnecessary suffering to many Irish women and families since its inception in 1983. One of the many lessons to be learned from 1983 is the need for the Legislature to be trusted as the Constitution is not the place and is unsuitable for detailed provisions, which tie the hands of future generations. The Bill before the Dáil tonight on the eve of International Women's Day highlights the appalling way in which we treat our women in Ireland. The Thirty-second Dáil and the Ireland of 2017 have an opportunity with this Bill to say a firm "no" to criminalising women. We have not only abandoned women by forcing them to leave their own country to access a safe medical procedure, we have compounded the suppression by threatening and sanctioning women and doctors with severe punishment and threatening them with jail sentences of up to 14 years. This threat and stigma surrounding abortion puts women in a dangerous position and continues to tie the hands of doctors when it comes to emergency scenarios, which, if not responded to properly, as this country has learned to its eternal shame, can result in the unnecessary and avoidable deaths of mothers. We have also made our doctors powerless and placed women in frightening and inhumane situations. The heartbreaking personal journeys that we are all aware of have shown that we need to do everything within our power as legislators to ensure we do not punish women but rather show compassion for the difficult decisions that face women in this country. Women should not have to steal away from their country to access a safe medical procedure and not one woman’s life should ever be put in unnecessary danger. Women should not be branded, punished and treated as criminals. The Green Party recognises the ongoing work of the Citizens' Assembly but this does not mean that we abdicate our duties as legislators. The Government's amendment to the Bill paralyses that legislative function. The truth is this and previous Governments have lacked the political courage to deal once and for all with the issue. If this proposed legislative change is all we can do for now as legislators as we await a Government of courage, let us do exactly that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Táim sásta labhairt anocht ar son an rúin seo mar go ndíríonn sé ar chuid mhaith den mhí-chothromaíocht atá sa chóras oideachais seo againne, mí-chothromaíocht gur féidir leis an Rialtas a leigheas go héasca má chinntíonn sé infheistíocht do na hearnáil áirithe seo. I commend Deputy Thomas Byrne on bringing this motion before the House. The Green Party will be supporting it. Psychological services in our schools have been at crisis level for many years. Today, a total of 397 schools are without access to NEPS. These schools are at an extraordinarily unfair disadvantage and face unacceptable delays when it comes to access to assessment for special educational needs or behavioural difficulties. All schools need access to a full educational psychological service that facilitates early intervention work and appropriate screening programmes as well as vital assessment services and systems to ensure the necessary supports and resources are available to all children in need of same. The sad reality is that for many years parents from more affluent backgrounds have easily accessed the necessary educational psychological assessments for their children by paying for them privately. These reports are then utilised to assert the rights of these children to extra resources. However, children from more disadvantaged backgrounds have to take their place in an endless queue. The resulting delay means needs are not identified, appropriate resources are not provided and children fall behind in an educational system that moves quickly. It is a vicious cycle. The most disadvantaged become even more disadvantaged. This is evidenced by the fact that at present 131 DEIS schools are without access to a NEPS psychologist. I welcome the Minister's announcement of a new model of allocating teaching resources for special needs. I look forward to the new model being rolled out in September and I look forward to seeing how exactly it will work on a practical level. However, the key point is that the specific needs of all students are not only appropriately identified but adequately responded to with the necessary supports and resources as well. The provision of crucial services to students should not come down to luck of the draw in respect of where a school is based. All schools and students should have access to all services that NEPS provides, especially in the event of a crisis or a tragedy. The chronic shortage of places for students with autism spectrum disorder is addressed in the motion. Currently, schools can refuse to set up ASD units despite an obvious need for same identified in the locality. Herein lies the ongoing appalling discrimination on grounds of special educational needs taking place in many schools. However, it is not being addressed by the Government. The school inspection system does not help. Schools which have ASD units and many students with special educational needs are often questioned and criticised at the end of a school inspection in respect of why they do not attract more academic students. At the same time, schools that do not have ASD units and have few children with special educational needs are never asked at the end of an inspection why they have so few children with special educational needs. One of the main reasons for the shortage of ASD units in schools is the ability of a school to groundlessly refuse to set up an ASD unit. Representatives of these schools often suggest to parents who request such supports that they should try the school down the road or that the child would be better off in another school. This practice must stop. I will be submitting an amendment to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to give authority to the NCSE to compel schools to set up special classes where a need is identified. The Department of Education and skills must ensure that these classes or units are then adequately resourced. John F. Kennedy once said that not everyone has equal abilities, but that everyone should have equal opportunity for education. As legislators, we must ensure that equality of access and opportunity is always front and centre and at the heart of our educational system. Unfortunately, this is not the case at present. However, it is essential that it becomes the standard, the norm. It should never be compromised. Actually it must be a fundamental and overarching principle. It must be a priority underpinning all levels of the Irish education system.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This question relates to the fact that we as a country must invest in job creation in sustainable enterprises. Where is the long-term vision and plan and the joined-up interdepartmental thinking? What is the Government's plan to exploit the opportunity for thousands of jobs in the new renewable energy sectors in which it currently does not appear to be interested?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for the information she provided on the supports and initiatives currently running in the area. To be honest, I still do not hear a comprehensive strategy. Unfortunately, the one element that is missing is ambition and we must be ambitious in this area. We need sustainability and sustainable enterprises not just to be part of the strategy, but rather the cornerstone of the Government's jobs policy. A just transition to the green economy is not only the right thing to do, but it is the smart thing to do. The Government is falling behind both other countries and the private sector. The recent publication of the collaborative report between the International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Energy Agency commissioned by the German Government stated that, globally, we can create $10 trillion of value with 6 million new jobs by 2050. We need to seek to ramp up our national commitments to reach the goals of the Paris agreement. They are relevant not just to the Minister's colleague, Deputy Naughten, and his Department, but they are also incredibly relevant to this Minister and her Department. I do not see that joined-up thinking. This is the area in which we must grow our economy and it is where the jobs are located.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government must be much more active in helping create these new jobs in the renewable sector. Facilitating the movement of people into the sector while achieving our climate targets and fair and full employment in this country are indelibly linked. This is incredibly important for areas like the midlands, which currently has more than 3% greater unemployment than the rest of the country. The redirection of the peat public service obligation subsidy to the retrofitting industry could support more than 3,000 jobs, for example, with an average of 26 jobs per €1 million spent directly, indirectly or induced. In creating a great economy, I suggest we must do two things. We must invest in new and renewable sectors and incentivise private businesses to do the same. We must also ensure that nobody is left behind, with new jobs created and retraining or reskilling options available to harness the wisdom and expertise of generations of people who have worked on making energy production in this country as efficient as possible. This is the new economy and we cannot afford to be left behind.

The Green Party has proposed this motion because it believes the extension of maternity leave and maternity benefit for the mothers of babies who are born prematurely is a vital first step in tackling the particular challenges faced by the parents and families of prematurely delivered babies, as well as the babies themselves. I acknowledge the many parents who have written to me in recent weeks in support of this motion. I welcome the mothers, fathers and children who are in the Gallery for this afternoon's debate.  I thank them for their attendance. It is possible that any positive changes we make to maternity leave will be too late for some of them. They are not here for themselves, but for future mothers and fathers and future generations. I admire their strength, courage and generosity of spirit. Many of them know at first hand what is at stake today. They passionately want to see a more caring Ireland for mothers who are unexpectedly catapulted into a different world where they must face a challenge of a magnitude they have never have faced before.  A mother who wrote to me yesterday suggested that if people lived through these circumstances, they would not think twice about making this change. I welcome members of the Irish Premature Babies organisation to the Gallery. I thank them for supporting this motion. I acknowledge the selfless and dedicated work that is done tirelessly by this group and all charities to support and advocate for the families of premature infants and the premature infants themselves. One in every 16 women in Ireland will give birth to a premature baby. More than 4,500 babies are delivered before 37 weeks in this country each year. Some babies are born 17 weeks before their due date. The impact of premature birth on parents and members of the extended family can be significantly challenging and sometimes daunting. Ireland is a small country. Everyone knows parents who have been affected by the worry, shock, terror and uncertainty of the premature delivery of a baby, followed by long hospital vigils hour after hour, day after day, week after week and, in some cases, month after month. In such circumstances, parents rapidly become acutely aware of the scale of the varied worries and challenges they must face. They learn about infections, diseases and many other health challenges which premature babies are at much greater risk of contracting than full-term babies. While new parenthood is always a challenge, the mother of a premature baby has to deal with many additional challenges, the first of which is the sudden and unexpected timing of the birth itself. Many mothers do not have time to pack a bag for their stay in hospital, let alone be afforded the time to inform their employers in advance about events. When their stay in hospital ends and they are formally discharged, it is only the end of the beginning. In many respects, they are not discharged at all. Their thoughts are 100% focused like tunnel vision on the ongoing care and well-being of their babies. Due to the extent of their committed caring time, which is purely spent in the hospital environs, other people in the hospital who are unconnected to their plight sometimes mistakenly take them for being permanent members of the hospital’s caring professions. In one sense, they are - sometimes, unfortunately, to such an extent that they can selflessly neglect their own wellness and well-being. What does this State do at present? It fails to treat them differently from the other mothers who are fortunate enough to give birth to full-term babies. Today, the Dáil has an opportunity to say that there should be no more of this, to give these mothers a voice and to hear that voice. In acknowledging that voice and recognising the current inequality, the Dáil can resolve to address this issue in a meaningful way. The mothers of Ireland are watching us attentively today. I do not doubt that some of them are filled with nerves. I ask the Members of this House, who often have differences and disagreements in this Chamber, to stand together not for themselves or their respective parties, or even for new politics, but for mothers who find themselves propelled into a frenetic world in which the immediate and most pervading concern that permeates every second of their day is the fear that their babies might not survive. This fear can become speechless and suffocating for parents as they zealously watch their tiny and fragile children fighting for their lives in hospital. We know that emotionally draining and physically exhausting days, weeks and months lie ahead for such parents. As legislators, we cannot remove fear and worry from the parents of premature babies, but by extending maternity leave and benefit we can remove some of the incredible stress and strain from their already troubled lives. We can offer and deliver real help and make real change. An opportunity like the one we have today should not pass without acknowledging and paying tribute to the hard-working women and men who work in hospitals and health care facilities across the country. They work tirelessly, often in incredibly pressured work environments, to ensure the best professional expert care is given any baby who is born pre-term. Like the mothers I have mentioned, courageous doctors and nurses are unheralded champions. Under the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004, mothers are entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave and benefit and 16 weeks of unpaid leave. This generally comes into action on the birth of the baby. Babies who survive from the earliest gestations, such as 23 weeks, can spend months in hospital neonatal units because, as a result of being born prematurely, their major organs have not had enough time to develop in utero. Premature babies are at more risk of disease and infection than full-term infants. Babies who are discharged from neonatal units with definite long-term diagnoses or on supportive medical equipment need full-time care in the home.  Under current legislation, a mother will use up the majority of her maternity leave and benefit before her baby comes home from hospital. While it is possible for a mother to defer her maternity leave while her baby is in hospital, it is out of the question for many parents to go back to work while their baby is encased in a glass box and hooked up to tubes, especially when there is a great deal of evidence that babies benefit greatly from the touch and closeness of a parent on a daily basis. All of my three children were born at full term. In recent years, I have watched and listened to the heart-wrenching stories of friends and colleagues at work who have had premature babies.I cannot begin to imagine and comprehend the worry, stress and upheaval that parents go through when their babies are born prematurely. The current length of maternity leave and benefit does not recognise the difficulties faced by the mothers of premature babies who are forced to commence their maternity leave long before their babies come home. Research has shown that mothers of premature babies record significantly higher rates of post traumatic stress disorder than mothers of full-term infants and that these traumatic reactions can remain active in the long term and require extensive follow-up. I am bringing the motion before the Dáil to shed light on how unfair and unacceptable the current legislative regime is for parents of premature babies and to seek change. Politics can help and has the potential to make a real difference today. The motion calls on the Government to extend the period of available maternity leave and benefit by a variable degree for all mothers of babies who are born prematurely, extending it from the day the baby is born to the day the baby would have been born if born at full-term. In cases where premature babies are kept in hospital past what would have been their full-term, the extended maternity leave and benefit would continue until the baby is discharged. It is essential that the entitlement is made available, in addition to all current maternity leave and benefit entitlements.  The net effect of this change would be that when a baby is born prematurely, his or her mother would not start her six-month entitlement to maternity leave and benefit until the equivalent full-term of the baby has been reached or the baby has been discharged from hospital. While her infant is in hospital, the mother need not worry about eating into her six months of maternity leave. Only once the baby is discharged and is safe and healthy at home should the current six-month period commence. The motion also calls on the Government to consider extending paternity leave under these circumstances, and to provide additional financial support where necessary for families of premature babies for travel and accommodation costs so the family can stay together. Parents should receive greater support from their employers and, therefore, I call on the Government to arrange that appropriate advice be published for all employers on how to do this and to require employers to have a policy in place for supporting the parents of premature babies. While most employers treat employees who find themselves in these unexpected circumstances with compassion, it is essential that they know how best to support them. New mothers need to feel confident of their rights in the workplace. These are all practical and reasonable steps, and will make a significant difference to parents of premature babies.  It is important to note that not all premature infants have health issues, and not all babies who are born at or past full-term are born healthy. There are many sick babies who are born at full-term whose parents still live in worry and fear for their babies' health, and today my heart goes out to them. I also aware of the fact that sometimes the parents of premature babies may bring home their baby within days of birth, healthy and into a new and happy household. However, for those who are born prematurely the challenges are unbelievably daunting. In advance of this debate, I received numerous communications and I would like to share one letter I received from a mother of a premature baby. I will read some excerpts to the House. She states:Dear Catherine,I am writing to you to share my experiences as a mother of an extremely premature baby who was born four months early in 2014 at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street. Patrick arrived unexpectedly at 23 weeks plus one day's gestation weighing approximately one pound four ounces. To get an idea of Patrick's actual size at birth, his body was the size of a mobile phone. His legs were the length of an adult's baby finger.During labour, I was informed by the consultant neonatologist that Patrick had less than a 10% chance of survival and that they would know within three minutes of his birth whether they would take him immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) or hand him back to me to hold in his final minutes of life. I will remember that moment and those words for the rest of my life. There was no joyful cry at birth, only the sound of clinicians working frantically to save our baby boy who faced life's biggest nemesis - death.My maternity leave of 26 weeks commenced the day after Patrick was born. There were no congratulatory cards, no shiny balloons, no photos of my husband or I holding our little boy. Only silent tears, trying to hold it together for each other, living hour-to-hour, day-to-day for the first two months. Our little boy, the apple of our eyes, the beam of our smiles, and the love of our lives, spent the next 18 weeks in ICU. He was on life support for 70 days, had 11 transfusions, an open heart valve, biochemical difficulties, chronic lung disease, hernias, severe reflux and retinopathy... Our world came crashing down when at seven weeks post birth, Patrick had kidney failure and crashed requiring resuscitation. Though our hearts were utterly broken, Patrick never gave up - one of his many traits. We learned that day to never underestimate a premature baby or any child. They can surpass all that is expected of them and much more. They are stronger than any adult.  After 18 weeks and following Patrick's discharge as an inpatient in Holles Street, I had 8 weeks remaining of paid maternity leave.  Ten months post birth... I realised I was functioning on autopilot and during a visit to my GP was diagnosed with... post traumatic stress disorder. Discussing one's mental health is difficult and a mother to admit that she feels fearful, anxious, or down, well this is in contrast to what society expects of a new mother and especially of one whose baby has survived [against] the odds. But I don't mind sharing this experience with you and others because I was living every day with a heightened sense of fear that Patrick might die suddenly; that his survival was just too good to be true. However, with the support of my wonderful husband, our families, and a counsellor, I learned how to integrate this traumatic experience into my life in a positive way. I end this letter on a positive, Patrick recently celebrated his 3rd birthday and is a beautiful, healthy and independent little boy.Patrick’s mum, Tara, is here today. Her story is just one story, and there are many more similar stories from mothers, fathers and families throughout the length and breadth of this country. Where are the supports for Tara and the thousands of other mothers every year who face this exhausting challenge of a lifetime? Many people who have written to me are shocked that we as a country have chosen to ignore rather than support and that what I am proposing is not already in place. Mar is eol do thuismitheoirí, is am faoi leith é nuair a shaolaítear leanbh tar éis aistear naoi mhí sa bhroinn. Bíonn gliondar agus faoiseamh orainn go bhfuil an mháthair in éindí lena naíon tar éis teacht slán trí ghnáth-thriail na breithe. Ach, le naíon a shaolaítear ró-luath roimh am breithe, anuas ar an ngliondar croí, bíonn briseadh croí fosta agus buairt. Níl faoiseamh ar bith i ndán do na tuismitheoirí mar tá an baol ann i gcónaí go bhféadfaí an leanbh leochaileach seo a chailliúint am ar bith.

Ach, tá rogha againn machnamh ar an gceist seo agus athruithe a dhéanamh chun maitheasa, ar mhaithe le meabharshláinte agus sláinte fisiciúil na máthar, mar aon le deis a sholáthar don naíon beag bídeach buntáiste a bhaint as teagmháil fisiciúil lena mháthair nó máthair. Is nasc nádúrtha é sin atá riachtanach do fhorbairt an naín leochailigh úd a shaolaítear ró-luath roimh am breithe.  This House has an opportunity to begin to put things right today. Members of all political parties and none have an opportunity to unite behind these mothers, to protect families and children and give them the help that they need and deserve. I implore and urge Members of the House to support this motion, and in doing so to allow mothers to have time to recover from a traumatic few weeks or months, time at home with their baby, time to hold their baby, time to care for their baby and time to watch their baby progress at home. I ask Members to support this motion and give mothers and babies that precious time together.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Members who contributed and I am delighted there is cross-party support for the motion. I am especially delighted for the mothers and fathers who are present in the Gallery to watch the debate as they seek a fairer system for mothers of premature babies. Present legislation and policy abjectly ignores, and is cruel in its disregard for, the huge unforeseen pressure and turmoil families face when caring for a premature baby. In some cases, parents from the country are compelled to travel for up to four hours on a daily commute to a neonatal intensive care unit. They incur significant expenses in medical care, accommodation, parking, transport and food and this puts severe stress on parents and their other children. At the time of a baby's arrival, parents' concerns, worries and anxieties are naturally focused on the baby's safe well-being and progress.At that time, maternity leave and maternity benefit may be one of the last things on a mother's mind but it will not take long until the mother faces the reality of being treated by the State in a markedly different and unfair way compared to mothers fortunate enough to give birth to full-term babies. Under current legislation, a mother, despite being shattered and exhausted after this unexpected and prolonged rollercoaster experience, will have used up the majority of her maternity leave before her baby even makes the first long-awaited journey home. Extending maternity leave and maternity benefits for the mothers of premature babies, as we seek in this motion, will give the support needed at a time of such upheaval and stress. This in turn will lead to better post-natal health, a better outcome for the baby, and eventually a better and more positive return to work. It is truly awful that mothers are not getting this support already because when premature babies finally get discharged from hospital, they need their mothers more than ever and their mothers need to be with them too.  Tá deis againn anocht teacht le chéile chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do mháithreacha. Tá ríméad orm go bhfuil an chuma air go bhfuilimid ar tí an deis sin a thapú agus, mar sin, a léiriú gur féidir leis an bpolaitíocht nua an beart a dhéanamh. Is féidir linn fíordhifríocht a dhéanamh anocht do na glúnta atá le teacht. The words of support spoken tonight offer hope and reassurance to thousands of mothers in Ireland. I welcome the words of support but words alone will not be enough. It is way past time for real, concrete action. Although I welcome the Government's support of this motion and its intention to address this issue in the family leave Bill, I ask it to treat the issue with a greater sense of urgency. I urge the Government to commit to providing for the extension of maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies in the budget this autumn. As mentioned earlier in the debate this evening, providing for this in the upcoming budget should come in at a cost of approximately €5.4 million. That is a relatively small cost that could make such an incredible difference for mothers of premature babies.  I conclude by saying if we are to truly cherish all of our nation's children, then we also need to cherish all mothers equally by supporting them in their devoted care for their children.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíorshásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. It is essential for the proper operation of a State that the public has confidence, respect and trust in its police force but in recent times, there has been a worrying erosion of this by the inability or perhaps perceived unwillingness of the Garda Commissioner to properly and efficiently handle a number of serious crises that have emerged. It may be seen as unprecedented for the Dáil to vote on this motion and I accept that it is far from ideal but the scale of the unprecedented damage done to An Garda Síochána and the public perception of the force necessitates this unprecedented response. In supporting this motion, the Green Party is prepared not only to recognise the scale of the calamity but to act. A total of 146,865 District Court summonses for road traffic offences were wrongly issued while 14,700 convictions were wrongly imposed on members of the public due to Garda error. Nearly 1 million breath tests that never took place were recorded on the PULSE system. The Commissioner did not inform the Policing Authority of these discrepancies until 23 March after the publication of an article in The Irish Times. In supporting this motion, the Green Party has also taken into consideration that the Charleton tribunal of inquiry, which is investigating an alleged smear campaign against Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe, involves investigating the actions of the sitting Commissioner. More importantly, how can some current members of the Garda workforce give their vital oral testimony to this public sworn tribunal inquiry, including potentially damning or fractious evidence under cross examination from the Commissioner's barrister concerning the Commissioner herself? The subject matter of their respective complaints does concern or ultimately relate to their boss, the person to whom they are accountable and answerable. The adversarial and anticipated controversial oral evidence makes her continuing as Commissioner totally inappropriate. For the sake of public confidence in An Garda Síochána, recognising that public confidence is an essential requirement for gardaí to do their jobs effectively and recognising the essential work which the front-line women and men of An Garda Síochána do each day, we join in the call on the Commissioner to consider her position.In our opinion, the Commissioner would best serve the vast majority of her honest, brave, courageous and hardworking officers by standing down now. The Green Party believes that most rank and file gardaí - as well as the public - have long since lost confidence in the Garda Commissioner in the context of her ability and credibility regarding the implementation of far-reaching reforms that are needed. One such essential and urgent reform merits her replacement as Commissioner.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This question relates to the capital plan 2016-21 and its use of the word "sustainability". It is often the case that despite the prolific use of the word "sustainability" throughout the document and particularly in the fiscal and policy context section, it seems to primarily and solely incorporate what could be termed fiscal sustainability rather than a wider definition which might include concepts such as environmental sustainability. Will the Minister outline for the House what role he believes environmental sustainability plays in the provision of capital expenditure as an underlying base concept and not just a discrete section of the capital plan?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I appreciate that the capital plan features a number of measures to tackle climate change and deal with environmental sustainability, regrettably, environment is still considered a "selected driver" of long-term public investment requirements. The importance of climate change within the Government's capital plan is currently considered as only requiring intervention in respect of energy efficiency, renewable energy and flood prevention, despite the fact that both the Climate Change Advisory Council set up under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have advised that what is needed is "a major societal and economic transformation". The Environmental Protection Agency today delivered the catastrophic news that we will fail to meet our 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and that we are completely off target for our low-carbon transition by 2050 set out in the climate change Act. While this is first and foremost an environmental disaster, it also has the potential to be an economic one which would have a major impact on our fiscal sustainability. How is the Minister's Department preparing for the possibility of up to more than €5 billion in fines if we do not hit our emissions targets, a possibility which seems all the more real after today's news? Failure to meet these targets will have a serious impact on the economy and must be accounted for in the public purse. Where will the Minister find this money?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With respect, the report today from the EPA would suggest there is a huge gulf between the Government's words and the Government's action when it comes to climate change. It appears to me that the Government has reached a crossroads. It can accept the fact that, without a major turnaround in policy, we will not meet our emissions targets, which needless to say, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, is a road which should never be travelled, but in which case, for prudent fiscal responsibility and sustainability, the Minister's Department needs to provide a comprehensive plan as to how he will account for the money for significant fines imposed on the State for not meeting these targets. Alternatively, the Government needs a paradigm shift in how it thinks about sustainability. Environmental sustainability must not be confined only to the Department of the Minister, Deputy Naughten. Our public expenditure needs to be on sustainable infrastructure, for example, on the six cycleways proposed for Dublin instead of 1,500 km of roads, as IBEC has proposed. We are on a continuous upward trajectory on emissions, when we really need to be going in the opposite direction. Which will it be? Will we hit our targets or will we not? Does the Minister have an expenditure plan for either scenario?

This Bill put before us today is a welcome step towards creating a modern and patient-focused mental health care system. By changing the definition of consent in the Mental Health Act, we would be changing the provision of services radically. It would be an important step in destigmatising the process of seeking medical services for mental health issues. By giving control to the patient and allowing him or her to have a voice in his or her treatment, we take away some of the fears that face those who are in need of crucial services. This Bill is not, however, an ending point in the discussion of consent reform or many other reforms that are so badly needed in mental health services. Instead, this Bill should be treated as a springboard for further necessary amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001. For instance, the 2015 report from the expert group set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 recommended that section 56 be amended to include an understanding of consent wherein consent could be accompanied by the support of a family member, friend or appointed carer, advocate or support decision-maker. This recommended measure, which is not included in the Bill before this House, would be a strong step towards building a truly patient-focused service and creating an atmosphere of holistic support for the patient. This is just one recommendation out of 165 recommendations put forward by the expert group. However, so far, only one recommendation has actually been implemented by the Government. To make matters worse, no further implementation seems to be on the horizon, as the Government has not placed any of the recommendations on its legislative programme and has failed to meet its own timetable for updating, modernising and reforming the Mental Health Act. This is yet another example of the Government's heel-dragging approach to mental health reform. Why convene an expert group, ask it to review the Mental Health Act in detail and have it publish a thorough list of recommendations if the outcome is a document that is left to gather dust? Over the past year, I, like so many Members here, have spoken on the topic of mental health in this House. Regrettably, the recurring theme is that of inexcusable delay in implementing recommendations, in funding and in bringing about meaningful reforms. As the Government hesitates in reform of mental health services, ever more vulnerable people are left with services that are simply not up to standard. The Government must instill urgency into its actions. At this stage, many of the various stakeholders concerned are understandably and justifiably sceptical, if not a little bit cynical about words and about cherry-picking reform. Words alone, piecemeal reform and tinkering around the legislative edges are symptomatic of the Government's whole approach to mental health. While I welcome Deputy Browne's Bill, what is urgently required is a seismic governmental change and new direction in policy approach. There remains no evidence of the Government delivering a proportionate and appropriate response to the scale of this complex problem and ongoing huge challenge. The inaction by this and consecutive Governments is one of the shameful scandals of modern Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Cinnte go bhfuil an Comhaontas Glas fíor-shásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. I welcome this Bill and warmly commend Deputy Sherlock for bringing it before the House. The Green Party will, of course, be wholeheartedly supporting it. As many Members have said, the issue of microbead and micro-plastic pollution was first raised in the Oireachtas by my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, in the Seanad last November . The Senator brought before the Seanad a Bill which Deputy Sherlock's Labour colleagues in the Seanad were vocal in supporting, along with Sinn Féin and many Independents, including Senator O'Sullivan's colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group. Regrettably, however, the Government and Fianna Fáil, instead of progressing the Bill and looking to amend it at a later Stage, declined to give the Bill a Second Reading. I appreciate that the Minister has since taken steps on this issue, including having facilitated an extensive public consultation process and committed to notify the EU Commission and World Trade Organization formally of the State's intention to introduce a ban. These are positive steps, and this Bill is another positive step and one which the Green Party believes should be fully supported by this House. The Labour Party’s Bill seeks to do many of the things the Green Party's Bill sought to do. I welcome its introduction in this House and hope that it will see better fortune than our Bill did last November. The attention, focus and conversation which Senator Grace O’Sullivan started in her capacity as a legislator should not be underestimated and it clearly was an effective catalyst. It has always been the Green Party’s view that to make long-term successful inroads in a multifaceted approach to protecting the environment, it requires the active support of the majority of political parties and the same applies globally. No one political party has ownership of environmental issues, but for as long as that is the perception, the environment and, ultimately, the people will lose. That is why we must work together and this Bill presents an opportunity to do so. However, I would like to see provisions in this Bill for the monitoring of microbeads and micro-plastics by the Environmental Protection Agency, and for a differentiation to be drawn between microbeads and micro-plastics. Both of these provisions were present in Senator Grace O’Sullivan’s Bill and their inclusion would greatly strengthen Deputy Sherlock’s Bill. Deputy Eamon Ryan and I intend to bring forward amendments to that effect on Committee Stage. The arguments for the ban on microbeads have been outlined by Senator Grace O’Sullivan in the Seanad, and again by Deputy Sherlock and others today in this House, so I need not restate them. The central purpose of the Green Party moving its Bill in the Seanad, and the value of this conversation around microbeads and micro-plastics in the first place, was to highlight the much larger issue of plastic marine litter in general. Microbeads are just the tip of the iceberg. Some 150 million tonnes of plastics have accumulated in the world’s oceans and we continue to add up to 12 million tonnes every year. Not alone is this litter causing serious damage to our fish and other marine life but there are also considerable economic losses in tourism and fishing which the European Commission has said is estimated to cost up to €630 million a year for coastal and beach cleaning. This Bill is about the health of our seas. The banning of microbeads and micro-plastics is a first important and beneficial step, but we must be aware of the many other challenges facing us if we are to clean up our seas and sea beds. As an island country it is essential that we are a leading voice in Europe and on the world stage in calling for co-operation and coherent action in tackling marine litter. This is not any one country’s responsibility, but rather it is every country’s responsibility. I call on the Government to make our voice heard loudly and clearly. I urge every Member of this House to support the Bill, and take the first practical step in moving this Bill to the next Stage in order to tackle an aspect of one of the biggest issues facing our seas. With the support of this House, the process of beginning to tackle this problem becomes realistic and achievable.

The Bill seeks to tackle the issue of the baptism barrier in our schools and the place of religion in our schools. This is not the first time we have dealt with this issue in this House and not the first time I have had the opportunity to contribute on it. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills is currently examining two Bills - the Government's Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 and the Labour Party's Equal Status (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016. Neither Bill deals adequately with the issues created by the baptism barrier. I welcome Deputy Coppinger's Bill today because it seizes much more effectively on an opportunity to remove the baptism barrier from our schools. This is an issue the Minister in his Bill has skirted around entirely and which the Labour Party has sought only to water down instead of removing in its Bill. Schools should reflect the modern diversity of families and communities. No State-funded school should be able to discriminate for or against a child on the basis of his or her religion. Our country is home to a wide diversity of people with a wide diversity of faiths. It is essential that our schools be a place where all are welcomed, whether they are of any faith or none. We cannot continue with a system where taxpayers' money is funding discrimination in our schools. I welcome the provisions in this Bill which seek to remove religious instruction from the school day. Not alone is this necessary for equality in the classroom, but it shifts the onus onto parents and religious leaders for the education of their children in their faith. Our Constitution recognises parents as the primary educator of children, and it is right that they should take on the responsibility of educating their children in their faith if they so wish. It is, however, important that we note the contribution made by the religious to the education of our children and our young people down through the generations. For many years they were the only people willing to take on the burden of education for the children of Ireland and abroad, and many of us owe our education to schools founded and run by the religious. As legislators, however, we must do all in our power to protect our children from becoming isolated and insulated, and we cannot risk depriving our children of the rich lasting experience of encountering children who come from different cultures, different points of view or different religious beliefs. No child should be denied a friend because he or she prays in a different way or does not pray at all. A child who cannot interact with the wonderful diversity of our country and our world to the fullest extent is a child whose childhood has not been as rich as it ought to be. It is imperative we embrace our diversity as a nation. Our children are growing up in worrying times, facing the challenges of the far right and populists preaching intolerance and hate for those who are "other" - other nationalities, other races, other genders, other sexual orientations and other religions. However, children simply do not see these differences; they see only other children. We cannot let religious division keep some children apart from others. It is in our diversity that our children learn the values of tolerance and respect and love for others, regardless of religion or any other difference. Our responsibility is to show those who would hate and divide that we celebrate our diversity. We do not just tolerate diversity, but we embrace it and become enriched by it. We have a State and a society based on a Constitution that guarantees the equality of all, and discrimination on the grounds of religion can be no part of that. Religious discrimination has no place in a modern society. All schools in receipt of State funding should be fair, transparent, and inclusive. The Green Party will support the Bill because discrimination on the basis of religion would not be tolerated in any other walk of life, and the education system should be no different.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I seek clarity on the relationship between the Minister's office and the forward planning section of the Department in respect of the manner in which they communicate on the progress of announced new schools and major builds. This arises from the recent experiences of a number of schools in my constituency where the respective communicated experience with the Department has been immersed in uncertainty and confusion over future plans. The schools in question have found communications in respect of future plans and decisions to be erratic, indecisive, unreliable and ever-changing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The nub of the question was on what happened following patronage and following the announcement. A concrete example of where there needs to be more oversight and communication between the Minister's office and the forward planning section is Ballinteer Educate Together national school, which was announced as a primary school in 2012. A deal was negotiated between the Department and St. Tiernan's community school to house the school temporarily until it received planning permission for a permanent home. St. Tiernan's agreed because it was promised a PE hall but, five years later, there is no permanent home for Ballinteer Educate Together and no PE hall for St. Tiernan's. It is the manner in which Ballinteer Educate Together school is learning about its future which is of the greatest concern. In November last year the principal, staff and parents learned of the Department's plans to move the school to the Notre Dame campus via a tweet. That is unacceptable. Last month, parents from Ballinteer heard by word of mouth from other people that a Gaelscoil would now be moving into the junior school at Notre Dame. Despite the fact that only 27 school days are left until the summer break and despite repeatedly requesting the layout of classrooms, Ballinteer Educate Together has not been guided through exactly how the move will work or whether it will happen in June, July or August, and it has not been afforded a visit to the new campus by the Department. To compound the departmental communications fiasco, when the principal recently rang to seek clarity, she was told the forward planning section was under pressure planning for other schools. It is not good enough and I appeal to the Minister to communicate with the forward planning section so that clarity can be provided.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not acceptable for a school to learn of the plans for it by social media or word of mouth and that has to stop. I ask the Minister to keep schools informed of progress. Is he aware of the problems making progress with new builds? Is this lack of communication happening throughout the country? Is the forward planning department vastly underresourced and does the Minister need to prioritise funding for the section? Dublin Rathdown is a constituency which will soon not have enough schools to meet its needs. How is the Department planning for the future needs of schools and children? The lack of vision in the Department is worrying. The issues also affect another school in my constituency, Our Lady's Grove, where a large portion of the land has been put up for sale. I appreciate that the land is private land being sold by private organisations but the Department should seek to protect the lands at whatever cost, whether that be through purchase or seeking a long-term lease. I ask the Minister to keep communication open with these schools and to do what he can to protect our schools, our open spaces and our children's education.

Is cúis áthais dom an rún seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála anocht. Tá cúpla mí caite agam leis an Chomhaontas Glas ag plé na ceiste seo, ach caithfidh mé a rá anois, tar éis na tragóide úafásach le Grenfell Tower, gur níos práinní na cúrsaí seo ná riamh roimhe. Is údar imní cad a tharla i Londain an tseachtain seo caite. Tá dúalgas orainn cinntiú nach féidir a leithéid a tharlú in Éirinn. I am pleased to bring the motion before the Dáil. The Green Party has been working on it in conjunction with leading experts in this field in recent months. We published it weeks before the horrendous tragedy in west London last week. I offer my deepest sympathy to the families and friends of loved ones who were caught up and engulfed in the horrific fire that occurred last week in the land of our nearest neighbours. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha. Cuimhnímid orthu. The motion calls on the Government to properly tackle the sorry legacy of defects in housing construction and to strengthen building standards and regulations in order to safeguard against this building and regulatory failure ever recurring. This and the previous Government have shown no political appetite or given no priority to dealing effectively with serious problems and issues arising from appalling construction quality of so many homes built during the boom-time era. There has been a series of crises, including the well-documented Priory Hall debacle and the high profile Longboat Quay shambles, as well as many other serious and varied problems that have emerged the length and breadth of the country, including in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown. I appreciate that the newly appointed Minister is new to his brief. However, his party and Government colleagues certainly are not. In the past four years, we have had four Ministers with responsibility for housing. This shows the level of genuine intent and respect for the role of this ministry which is at the centre of the biggest crisis of our time. That is an indicator of how this critical ministry has been treated in recent times. It has become the revolving door ministry with no continuity, no stability and no appropriate demonstration of the level of priority and real action the crisis clearly and urgently merits. It is nearly six years since the Priory Hall development was found to be gravely defective yet there are no new remedies or proper building standards. Instead, we are still operating on a trust-the-builder basis. Homeowners and prospective homeowners are expected to put their faith in builders without an independent regulator. In case the Minister is unaware, he should know that people do not trust builders to self regulate. We are in the middle of a housing crisis and new homes are urgently needed, on which we are all in agreement. However, we cannot sacrifice the safety of people in their homes to pacify the construction industry lobby. Safety must be paramount in any and all construction. There is a duty on the Government to protect its people against greed-driven building standards and incompetent rogue cowboy builders. I emphasise that I am not saying all builders are incompetent. They are not all rogues either but a number of builders and developers have done an extraordinary disservice to the many genuine, decent, hard-working people involved in the industry. This evening, we have an opportunity to take the first concrete steps in stopping rogue builders in their tracks by introducing measures that, once and for all, would put individuals and families first and protect them against these chancers. In essence, that is the priority. We need to protect ordinary consumers who buy their dream family home in good faith. In January I asked the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, how many times the issue of defective buildings had to rear its ugly head before the people affected by it had some level of certainty about the relief they could seek. Many months later, the same people are still in limbo and uncertain about what assistance, legal or financial, the State can provide for them. In his reply to me in this House in January the former Taoiseach also said he could not guarantee that there would be no more Priory Halls or Longboat Quays. Kevin Hollingsworth of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland recently said that in the past three or four years he had remediated 29 developments for fire safety issues. Not all of these find their way into the media spotlight and many of those involved feel compelled to suffer in silence. They are suffering at the hands of a Government which they believe is not listening to their needs and does not have the hunger or appetite to make a real difference in their lives. In case the Minister is in any doubt, he should know that some individuals and families, including some of those in the Visitors Gallery, are suffering immense and ongoing stress and incredible financial pressure as a result of the State granting builders a type of carte blanche, giving them a near free-for-all to do what they want. Must these homeowners and the many others who have yet to learn how they will be affected by defective buildings forever be reliant on a Government which continues to act in an ad hoc wait-and-see manner? Last week we heard the horrifying news of the fire at Grenfell Tower in London. Our hearts are with the families of those who lost their lives but our minds must be set on ensuring it does not happen here. In response to the tragedy Chi Onwurah, MP, wrote in The Guardian last week that for her, the souls of the dead were in every sub-clause of every tranche of health and safety legislation. Health and safety are matters of dull box checking and red tape at times but they are also absolutely vital. At issue is the homes of people. This is a matter of public health and safety but sometimes, ultimately, it can also be a matter of life or death. In order to ensure safety - the most fundamental of protections - we need radical change in how we view and value buildings. We need to act with a safety first attitude, not simply talk about it. As Members of this House, we need to stand up, once and for all, to the construction industry and put people's lives first. It was reported recently that the Construction Industry Federation was writing the new building control Bill.While that report has been noted by the Department as being incorrect, it still does not help dissuade us of the picture of a Government which has been for far too long too close to the influential construction industry and too passive in its willingness to enforce high standards. This is not something we would tolerate in the food industry, road safety or car safety, where people's health is at stake. There is no reason to tolerate it when it comes to the standards and safeties at which we build people's homes. Our housing is a public safety issue. We need a regulator, like our food regulator, with specialised statutory powers to name and shame dodgy builders who put people's health and safety at serious risk, which is empowered to put things right. In order to do this, in the motion before the House today, the Green Party is calling on the Government to create a new, strong, independent building regulator. We need a properly funded national building regulation office wherein such a building regulator will oversee national building control and actively and robustly regulate those involved in construction. We need to stop systematic failures in building control happening again and again by ensuring that building standards are raised and that there is appropriate building control compliance in this country, including fully resourcing the new building regulator office with a real and effective enforcement agency. We must provide protection and support for homeowners who discover serious latent defects in their homes by improving existing legal remedies. This country has been plagued by cowboy developers and there is very little in the current building control regime safeguarding against and stopping it from happening again. There is no comfort for the consumer. We cannot say that we have not been warned. The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 put in place an assigned certifier system but there are still huge problems with this. As Orla Hegarty of UCD has said, a self builder or developer is effectively appointing someone to police him-or herself while the appointed person does not have to be independent of the process and has no legal powers. As it stands, there is no guarantee that the assigned certifier must be independent of the developer. In fact, he or she can still be an employee of the developer and have other close links to the developer he or she is certifying. This set up fails to instill trust and confidence for ordinary consumers. It totally undermines the concept of independent regulation and is not something we would accept in any other industry, particularly one in which people’s lives could be put at risk. We need to look at the regulation of the construction industry in terms of risk management. We need to put the resources in place for ongoing inspections from fire services and fire safety authorities, not just a fire safety certificate before one starts. I welcome the new statutory regulations which will come into effect soon, requiring houses to be built in such a way as to prevent the spread of fire internally and externally and to have an adequate means of escape. These regulations will also impose obligations on landlords to ensure that rented properties meet certain standards. However, they must be accompanied by adequate resourcing of building control authorities for ensuring compliance and dealing effectively with breaches. How can the Government promise building standards will be adhered to if it cannot promise that independent inspections will actually be carried out? All the rules in the world do not matter if there is no credible threat of enforcement. How can the Minister assure the public and promise there will be no dangerous shortcuts if he provides no enforcement? The enforcement agency must have real teeth and not be regarded as a harmless pushover by builders. How many convictions have there been under the Building Control Act since it was introduced in 1992? The former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, could not answer that when I submitted a parliamentary question. Nobody seems to know and that is very alarming. Worse still, many innocent people who are caught up in this storm, which is not of their making, believe that this Government does not care. Local authority reports are light on detail when it comes to enforcement by building control authorities. Again, when I put a parliamentary question to the Minister's predecessor earlier this year, I was told that his Department is not responsible for the oversight of building control authorities. How can the Minister be sure of the strength of the enforcement of building regulations if he does not have oversight over the actions of building control authorities? At this stage, people quite reasonably wish to judge the Minister on deeds and not mere words alone. There are 31 building control authorities in this country but they are not compelled to produce an annual report. A leading academic in this field, Deirdre Ní Fhloinn, examined all 31 annual local authority reports for 2015. There was very little reference to enforcement, never mind prosecution. That is simply not good enough. Effective building regulation requires an independent regulator and that is why many experts in this field agree with the Green Party’s call for the establishment of an Irish building authority at arm’s length from the vested interest of the construction industry. There is compelling evidence in support of initiating step this evening. To do otherwise, however the Minister may dress it up, would be a cop out, an abdication of responsibility. I urge the Minister not to abandon the people of Ireland who may not have the deep, wealthy pockets of some developers and who suffered most but whose voice is least heard as they do not have easy and ready access to the powers that be in this country. Alongside this, it is vital that we do not lose sight of the goal of a real and lasting, long-term solution for residents, some whom are listening attentively to tonight's debate, who are the innocent victims of defective buildings. What redress and tangible support do these hard-working people have when major defects are discovered in their homes? In many cases the builder has gone bust but our forgiving corporate insolvency laws allow such builders to return to the workforce. They are given a fresh start, a second chance, a bright new day. Regrettably, in the proposed general scheme of the building control (construction industry register Ireland) Bill 2017, these rogue builders will continue to get second chances as it is proposed that a builder who is struck off for a period of time may apply to be restored to the register on merely demonstrating compliance with registration criteria and payment of the standard fee. It is not good enough. In contrast, the contractor responsible for the Berkeley balcony collapse has had its licence revoked for five years. Its managing director must pay the California Registration Board investigation fees of $99,000 before the licence can be granted and may still in due course face a custodial sentence. There are no second chances for the individual citizen in Ireland, for ordinary consumers when major defects are discovered in their homes. They do not enjoy such corporate protections. They are abandoned. How many times must this issue rear its ugly head before the people who are so adversely affected by it have some level of certainty about the relief they can seek? Simple first steps would include clarification from the Minister as to whether the Government is serious about offering tax reliefs for the undertaking of essential repair works. Giving income tax relief in respect of the repair costs incurred together with a suspension of local property tax and VAT relief along the lines of the home renovation initiative are all practical, reasonable measures which can, if the political will exists, be implemented quickly in order ease the burden on residents. Second, the Government should consider creating a loan fund for those who cannot pay. Section 71 of the 1966 Housing Act has a model for how this can work and this needs to be adapted and rolled out by local authorities to give assistance to homeowners. In conjunction with the implementation of these measures, as is stated in this evening’s Green Party motion, it is crucial that the Government introduce a transmissible warranty of quality from builders or developers in favour of all subsequent purchasers so that damages can be sought from the original developers, ensuring there can no longer be any place to run and no shelter or place to hide for rogue builders. An inexpensive, consumer-friendly dispute resolution mechanism for homeowners should be established. Landlords and tenants who find themselves in dispute in respect of a tenancy have easy access free of charge to the RTB dispute resolution service.However, what resolution do home owners have facing into this unprecedented storm? They have none.  In order to ensure the State will never again be taken as a soft touch, it is crucial that increased resources must be pooled into this arm of local government with responsibility for robustly monitoring new builds and in order to be taken seriously, a properly resourced enforcement agency must work in tandem with a supervisory division to ensure that inadequate building standards will not be tolerated.  Twenty five years of evidence tells us that leaving the construction industry to its own devices results in widespread dangerous breaches. Will one of the Minister's first acts as Minister with responsibility for housing be to support this motion, to stand up to the construction industry and in doing so stand up for the health and safety of the people or will it be to cave in to vested interests, given them their way and allowing them to continue to put lives at risk? The tragic inferno in west London last week is a stark reminder that the overriding priority underpinning all construction must be the safety of residents. In the rush to build the houses so urgently needed in this country, we must ensure that this time we do it right and that all houses are built to an acceptable and safe standard. The Members of this House have a duty to create a legislative framework to support all those who are living the nightmare of having had defects discovered in their homes and to prevent this happening to another generation of home owners. I ask them to consider these home owners and what they are going through, to help them and to stop it from happening to another generation of home owners.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State and wish them well in their respective roles. I thank Members for their contributions to the debate. The record of building control authorities in taking high-profile enforcement action and prosecutions has been criticised by both the Pyrite Panel in 2012 and last week by the expert panel on blockwork in Donegal and Mayo. Yesterday, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was reported as saying that a register of enforcement notices served and the outcome of any decision of the District Court in respect of an enforcement notice are held by Ireland's 31 building control authorities. However, as it stands, to find out statistics about building control authority enforcement, one needs to visit the offices of all 31 building control authorities during office hours. By contrast, the Food Safety Authority has a website which contains a significant amount of information across its range of activities, is updated regularly and includes details of enforcement orders issued. It operates a consumer helpline that received almost 12,000 calls in 2015. It co-ordinates inspection and reporting from around the country through 33 official agencies operating locally. The Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, which was referenced and lauded by the Minister, was created by the construction industry. It is like putting the foxes in charge of the hen house. The fact that CIRI will be separate from the Government's planned lead local authority is very problematic because it is a requirement for registration with CIRI that an applicant declares convictions under the Building Control Acts. As was reported yesterday, convictions under the Building Control Act are not recorded centrally but are on 31 registers throughout the country. I would like clarity from the Minister as to how the CIRI admissions board will check that an applicant or a registered member is telling the truth about previous convictions. How will the CIRI board verify information from applicants from overseas who have an entitlement to work in Ireland? If there were a national regulator with enforcement powers and centralised access to each of those 31 registers of enforcement notices and District Court orders, it would have a full picture of a person's compliance record, how many enforcement notices have been issued against him or her, whether he or she has convictions under the Act and whether he or she is a fit and proper person to be allowed to carry out building work. No regulatory body will oversee the operation of CIRI the way that the energy regulator does for the registered electrical contractors of Ireland and registered gas installers, which are the registration bodies for electrical and gas installers. This is why our motion seeks the creation of an Irish building authority. It is not a quango. It is a regulatory body and we need a real, strong independent regulator. There is a lot of merit in Fianna Fáil's amendment and I am glad to see it has followed our lead on the law reform needed to deal with remedies. However, its motion does not recognise that a national regulatory body would provide the essential oversight of existing building control in a manner which is not being done at present and a supervisory regulatory role in respect of the proposed construction industry register. Regrettably, the Minister cannot see the merit of this authority either. What the Minister proposes would keep these two functions separate, which makes no sense at all - one body to inspect and enforce compliance with building regulations and a totally separate private body that is given a monopoly on registration and fees for those who will be responsible for complying with those rules. The national building control management system, which was mentioned by the Minister, aims to appoint a lead local authority which will have overall responsibility for building control management on a national level. That authority will not operate as a regulator. The lead authority referenced by the Minister will have no legal obligation to exercise a regulatory oversight function in respect of the national activities of building control authorities, to co-ordinate regulatory activities and enforcement, and to publish information relating to this work.Enforcement will continue to be decentralised among 31 building control authorities, without a single public-facing profile that could educate people about the value of building control and could publicise building control activity, including enforcement, on a regular basis in an accessible format. People deserve better than a "wait and see" attitude from a Government that has yet to face up to the scale of the problems so many are facing, and it needs to consider practical ways in which it can help. Many homeowners have spent years trying to secure legal remedies through the courts and through arbitration, putting their lives on hold while they do. In the Minister's counter-motion, it is quite clear that the Government will continue to refuse to give support to these homeowners, and that is nothing short of disgraceful and an abdication of responsibility. I welcome his call on local authorities in recent days to review multi-storey social housing units, but why not call for a nationwide audit of all multi-unit housing and a Government fund to deal with dangerous defects? I thank the many Deputies who spoke in support of the motion. No doubt the people on the front line, the real people both in the Gallery here tonight and those at home who are affected by this through no fault of their own have hung onto every word that has been said. We, as Members of this House, must do everything in our power to protect and support homeowners whose lives have been turned upside-down and have been hurled into a heartless financial pressure zone, all as a result of greed-driven cowboy builders and we must prevent this happening to another generation of homeowners.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is cúis áthais dom gur éirigh leis an gComhaontas Glas an Bille tábhachtach agus practiciúil seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála anocht. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a chur in iúl freisin do Pháirti an Lucht Oibre as tacú leis an gComhaontas Glas an Bille seo a chur i láthair. Go deimhin, gabhaim ár mbuíochas freisin leis an réimse leathan Teachtai atá i bhfábhar an Bhille. The co-operation we have seen, with politicians from all parties and none, clearly shows that to tackle the greatest threat that lies before us as a nation and a people and the world, we must work together. No one political party has ownership of environmental issues, but for as long as that is the perception, the environment and, ultimately, the people will lose. That is why we must work together and the Bill presents an opportunity to do so. In Ireland, we are producing in the region of 210,000 tonnes of plastic per year, but only 40% of plastic packaging is recycled. The level of micro-plastics pollution in Irish waters is now so severe that recent research shows eating freshwater fish may constitute a risk to people's health. It is clear that the prevention of waste is the best cure for the current plastic crisis. In 2002, Ireland proudly initiated the first plastic bag tax in the world. Once again, it has the opportunity to be a world leader in banning plastic. The Bill, however, and environmental issues and challenges should not be viewed or seen in isolation. These problems do not recognise borders, nor is it relevant which political party delivers. It is the power of the people in communicating their serious concerns through the body politic that is the real catalyst for us to respond to take effective steps to secure our children's future; it is the power of the people in taking a stand and saying enough is enough, that more can and must be done. It is clear that the Members of this House of all political parties and none are listening to the people. They are embracing new politics, although judging from some of the Minister's comments, he is not quite embracing new politics but going in kicking and screaming, still unable to think big and full of doubt rather than the vision needed. The majority of us in opposition, however, are willing to cast past differences aside, united in a type of Opposition rainbow coalition response, or if not a rainbow coalition, perhaps rainbow co-operation, to ensure the Bill will be passed and in so doing that we take one small but meaningful step to tackle the greatest challenge of our time.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíorshásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. The Government lacks vision and strategic planning when it comes to the scale of the housing and homelessness crisis, which severely affects the most vulnerable in our society. I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is relatively new to his brief. However, his party and the Government certainly are not. In the past four years we have had four Ministers with responsibility for housing. This is indicative of the Government's track record and shows the level of genuine intent, level of priority and respect for the role of this Ministry, which is at the centre of the biggest crisis of our time. It is an indicator of how this critical Ministry has been treated in recent times. It has become the revolving-door Ministry, with no continuity, no stability and no appropriate demonstration of the level of priority and real action the crisis clearly and urgently needs. Government statistics for July show there were 1,429 families without homes. The figures have gone up by 25% in one year. The number of children without a home now stands at almost 3,000. That is 3,000 children without a place to call home. It is time for this Government to view housing as a human right and one which must be enshrined in the Constitution. Earlier this year, the Green Party introduced a Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill in the Seanad that would have addressed the specific problem of land hoarding in a number of ways, but remarkably in a time of an unprecedented crisis in homelessness, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chose to vote against this Bill in the Seanad.  The State needs to create an affordable housing provision agency and implement a cost-rental model for affordable and social housing, which would be delivered by a newly-formed national housing trust linked to local authorities that would be outside the general government sector and provide a combination of affordable and social housing, either directly or through community land trusts or housing associations. The institution should ideally incorporate the capabilities developed in the Housing Agency and NAMA and could be an amalgam of the two. It would also incorporate existing expertise in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the local authorities and in the housing associations and co-operatives.  The housing issue is complex and there is a huge number of variables and perspectives which the Government needs to take into account to tackle it. It is absolutely unacceptable that the lack of real action we have seen from this Government continues. The Green Party will support this motion to show that the Dáil not only recognises the magnitude of the problem but the extremely urgent and present need to take immediate and effective action. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ireland's pension gap has widened in the lifetime of this Government and the previous one. Women work outside home in fewer numbers with most getting paid less when they do. When it comes to retirement, women now typically have 37% less to live on than men. On 21 September the Taoiseach announced plans for a new pension strategy to be completed by the end of the year, including a five-year roadmap for pension reform. As Minister for Social Protection, he also committed to conduct an overall pension review that was to be completed by the middle of this year. It is now almost October and it is not known if that pension review has been completed, let alone published. Many women who got up early in the morning for years to work or look after the nation's children are now entering an insecure impoverished retirement. They will have limited access to pensions because of low pay, poor conditions of work and having to take time out for caring responsibilities. Women who worked on family farms and in family businesses also do not have social insurance coverage meaning they are totally reliant on their husbands in older age. What steps will the Government take to analyse the differential impacts of pension policy for men and women? Will it redress these glaring, flagrant inequalities among pensioners currently in receipt of benefits? Lack of access to the homemaker's scheme has led to experiences of severe inequality for an entire generation of women in the State pension system. The homemaker's scheme only allows for the backdating of pension contributions to 1994. What about all the women before 1994? Let us not forget the State-enforced marriage bar, which up to 1973 meant women had no choice but to give up their public service and Civil Service jobs when they got married. Tens of thousands of women are out in the cold and are forgotten. They do not receive equal treatment because of a sudden unfair cut-off point of 6 April 1994. This is simply not good enough; they deserve better. The Taoiseach has said he plans to reward work and enterprise in the budget and yet he has claimed that pensions for these women, forcibly barred from work by the State, would be too expensive. Indeed they should be paid reparations and not a mere State pension. It is never too late to do the right thing. Will the Government commit to backdating the homemaker's scheme to 1973, rather than this discriminatory cut-off point of 1994? When will the Government publish the review on the differentiated impacts of pension policy? Will this be published before any new strategy is conducted or will the Government continue its penchant for revolving-door Ministries that never seem to finish any jobs they start?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister but, with respect, it is hard for those women who have been denied their pension entitlements to take all that he has said at face value given that actions taken by this and the previous Government, rather than addressing the inequalities in the pension-pay gap, have only allowed them to deepen. In 2012, the previous Government introduced changes to the eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension. That had the effect of increasing the number of PRSI contributions required for the higher payments and women are most likely to lose out because of periods out of the workforce due to family responsibilities or having held part-time employment. Of the 36,000 people the Department of Social Protection records as being affected by the changes from June 2016, more than 62% were women. Will the Government reverse the 2012 changes to pension contributions? As budget 2018 approaches, I remind the Minister that women benefit less from cuts to income tax as they are more likely to find themselves in part-time and low-paid jobs and take time out from work for unpaid care responsibilities. The priority in the upcoming budget should lie in investment in public services and any tax cuts need to be in the form of progressive taxation that will benefit women and men equally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is oth liom a chur in iúl don Teach nach bhfuil rian ceannaireachta nó fís ag baint leis an mbuiséad seo agus is easpa uaillmhéine a léiríonn sé, seachas uaillmhian. For the first time in ten years, we have a balanced budget. Ten years of pain and sacrifice were suffered by many and, unfortunately, many more continue to suffer as innocent victims of reckless financial mismanagement. This budget presented an historic opportunity to do things differently, but it has turned into a glorious mis-opportunity. Budget 2018 had the potential to be a perfect window to begin to make structural and systemic change and to shape a budget for our society, not just our economy. Instead, we have a budget which does a little bit for everyone and nothing significant for anyone. The little bit for everything is an unsustainable con job and it is clear that what the Government has succeeded in doing, at least in the short term, is abating people’s anger, causing a focus on real priorities to be temporarily lost. It is engaged in camouflaging, cleverly distracting people from what should be a pressing and fundamental priority, namely, a caring, compassionate society. To give some credit and recognition where it is due, however, the Green Party welcomes some announcements in this budget.I welcome the extension of maternity leave and benefit for mothers of premature babies, which follows on from the Green Party motion passed by the Dáil in April. For those who point-blank dismiss the entirety of new politics, the breakthrough in delivering a better society for mothers of premature babies should be seen as a constructive example of how new politics has the clear potential to work. This is a concrete outcome. Unfortunately, however, it is an isolated breakthrough that does not give solace or represent the seismic shift in Government policy required to prioritise families and put people at the heart of a caring and inclusive society. This is because there is still a distinct lack of coherent vision in the budget. Overall, there is nothing new in budget 2018. The Government still operates as if the market can and will solve all problems. It still acts as though climate change is a problem that the private market alone can solve. The Government still acts as though the housing crisis is one that the private market alone can solve. This is a budget of missed opportunities. What could it have been? This had the potential to be a budget for mental health. It could have been used to make a substantial investment in mental health, translating words into action and demonstrating, delivering and making A Vision for Change a reality. Instead, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, speaking with representatives from Mental Health Reform earlier today, confirmed that the €35 million announced for mental health services in the budget includes €20 million promised for this year. A mere €15 million extra is set aside for vital mental health services in budget 2018 when the Government knows that experts in this field are of the opinion that a minimum of €55 million is required. Mo náire sibh. Our mental health services are struggling. Many hours have been devoted in this Chamber to well-meaning speeches about the importance of mental health. How is it that when push comes to shove and all the cards are on the table, the Government continually comes up short in the context of supporting mental health? By reneging on its commitment to invest appropriately in our mental health services, the Government signalled its utter disinterest, if not contempt, for the human rights of those with mental health symptoms. These are some of the most vulnerable people in society and they simply do not have a voice of their own. The budget also confirms in the minds of many shattered families that their agonising wait for appropriate interventions and supports for their loved ones will continue under this Government's watch. Tragically for some, this wait has proved fatal. It copper-fastens the sense of hopelessness to which they have become accustomed since A Vision for Change, a blueprint document full of vision but followed with snail-paced change, was launched. According to research, those who suffer from mental illness need a sustained sense of hope. The Government, however, continues to feed them with hopelessness. The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care commenced its deliberations in recent weeks. I am delighted to be a member of this committee. However, yesterday's budget does not instil much hope that the Government will pay any attention to our deliberations or recommendations because nowhere in his speech did the Minister for Finance even refer to the Sláintecare document produced by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. I hope the workings of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care will not be treated with the same disregard and disrespect. This could have been an historic budget, heralding a new era in attitude and thinking in terms of how the Government treats and prioritises mental health. Alas, it certainly is not that. This is a budget of missed opportunity. What could it have been? It could have been the budget of investment in education and youth. There is an increase in the levy on employers contributing to the National Training Fund, which is to be welcomed. However, the scale of the investment needed is not there. This investment will not even be able to keep up with the increase in numbers in third level in the coming years. Again, this is a case of the Government moving forward just to stand still. While the direction is welcome, it is not nearly enough. Investment is not investment if it is just to stand still. There is no evidence in this budget of treating third-level education as an investment in our society and our future. A €250 reduction in fees would have come at a relatively small cost to the State. It would have eased some of the financial pressure students are facing in the context of fee payments. Such a reduction was not made in the budget, however. Once again, the Government is refusing to prioritise access to education. There is no increase in SUSI grant thresholds and the €200 charge for post-leaving certificate courses, which continues to act as an impediment and obstacle to participation for many students, has not been removed. There is also no restoration of the grants available for Gaeltacht placement for student primary teachers, a mandatory aspect of their studies which students must now continue to undertake at their own expense. Níl sé sin ceart nó cóir. While the increase in teacher numbers at second level and the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools are to be welcomed, I do not see any indication that the Government is going to address the significant inequality of treatment in the teaching profession. There is a two-tier, indeed three-tier, system whereby newly-qualified teachers earn more than 20% less than their colleagues. This is despite the fact that they are doing the same job and have the same responsibilities. A recent OECD report, Education at a Glance, found direct correlation between teachers' pay and the quality of education. The teaching profession has been devalued and this will have a detrimental effect on the future quality of education. Neither has the Government addressed the inequality in pensions. Thousands of women are left in a scenario where, in retirement, they now typically have 37% less to live on than men. Many women who got up early in the morning for years in order to work or to look after the nation's children are now entering an insecure and impoverished retirement. They will have limited access to pensions because of low pay, poor conditions of work and having to take time out for caring responsibilities. The homemaker's scheme only allows for the backdating of pension contributions to 1994. What about all the women who were active prior to 1994? It must be remembered that the State-enforced marriage bar meant that up to 1973, women had no choice but to give up their public service and Civil Service jobs when they got married. The homemaker's scheme should have been backdated to 1973. In 2012, the previous Government introduced changes to the eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension. This had the effect of increasing the number of PRSI contributions required for the higher payments. Women are more likely to lose out because of periods of being out of the workforce due to family responsibilities or being in part-time work or insecure employment. Tens of thousands of women are out in the cold and have been forgotten. They deserve better. They deserve equality. This budget was an opportunity for the Government to end this blatant discrimination by reversing the 2012 changes to pension contributions but it continues to turn its back on thousands of women. This is simply not good enough. Inequality for young people is also not being addressed. There is the inequality in the area of social welfare, namely, the reduced rate of social welfare payments for young people under the age of 26. Why did the Government not end this discrimination by restoring the full rate of social welfare payments for those under 26? This is a budget of missed opportunities. What could it have been? This could have been the budget for housing. Instead, we have a budget that does more of the same. It does nothing differently. The announcement of €750 million for the HBFI scheme relates to the planned construction of cheap houses by developers. The increase in the vacant sites levy is to be welcomed, especially when one considers that, earlier this year, when my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, introduced the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill in the Seanad, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chose to vote against it. I welcome the Government's recognition now that this increase is needed. However, it is being done without conviction. We will not see the full effect of it until at least 2019. This budget could have seen a shift to focusing on a cost-rental model of local authority building. Instead, the Government is continuing with its outdated logic to the effect that the private market alone can fix the crisis in housing and homelessness.Where are the tax reliefs for home owners in whose homes major defects are discovered? Simple first steps would include offering tax reliefs for the undertaking of essential repair works through income tax relief in respect of repair costs incurred, a suspension of local property tax and VAT relief along the lines of the home renovation scheme. However, the Government has not provided any supports for those home owners in this budget and that is not good enough. It is a budget of missed opportunity. It could have been an ambitious climate action budget but it fails to serve the medium to long-term needs of the country that should be the underlying principle of any budget. It lacks long-term planning and a strategic vision for the people of our country. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, stated in a press release yesterday that "budget 2018 delivers leadership" and that the members of the Government "have been called to be deciders, implementers and change-makers". However, I see no real change, ambition or leadership. The essence of leadership is that one has a strategic and sustainable vision. This budget was an opportunity to be at the forefront of the new clean industrial revolution that is starting to happen and from which we have everything to gain. Every sector of society will benefit from a transition to a fair, clean, green economy. The scale of the change needed is similar to that made in the late 1950s and early 1960s when Ireland made a strategic decision to go from being a closed to an open international economy. This budget will not be remembered as groundbreaking and change-making in the mould of the work of Seán Lemass and T.K. Whitaker. It is not transformative and, rather, will be remembered as more of the same and providing minute nudges in the right direction. It is a budget of missed opportunity. It seeks to keep the status quo tipping along without effecting underlying structural change. Inequality will remain, as will discrimination against young people and women. The Government continues to ignore the opportunity of embracing a just transition to a new, green, fair economy. This budget is definitely not about a just society. It could have been remembered as a budget for mental health, investment in education, housing or ambitious climate action. Instead, it will be remembered only for a lack of strategic vision, fairness, ambition or leadership and as a budget for our economy, not our society.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. Maidir leis an mhíchothromaíocht atá á léiriú ag córas pinsin an Stáit i leith na mban sa náisiún seo, is léir don dall nach bhfuil meas a léiriú ag an Rialtas ar na mná seo. Agus mar sin, mar shocaí agus mar pholaiteoirí, caithfimid dul i ngleic leis an éagóir seo gan mhoill. The pension gap has widened in recent years between men and women, with women now having, on average, 37% less of a pension to live on than men. The introduction in 2012 of new bands for pensions, the homemaker's scheme not applying prior to 1994 and the marriage bar are all measures which discriminated strongly against women, and they all continue to maintain discrimination in society and the economy today. The Taoiseach said that he planned to "reward work and enterprise" in budget 2018, but it appears that fair pensions for women forcibly barred from work by the State were not on the radar of his so-called just society or republic of opportunity. The Green Party has submitted an amendment to this motion seeking the homemaker's scheme to be applied retrospectively to 1973 and calling on the Government to indicate a timeline to eliminate this patent discrimination which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has described as both "bonkers" and "unbelievable". In 2012, the previous Government introduced changes to the eligibility criteria for the contributory State pension, changes which adversely and disproportionately affect women. The Government seems intent on continuing this discrimination, as it indicates plans to replace the current system with the "total contribution" approach for "new" pensioners from 2020 - the key word here being "new", as the Government will be ostracising pre-2020 pensioners by excluding them.The Green Party amendment to the motion calls on the Government to ensure that any such introduction would apply to all contributory State pensions and pensioners. I commend Deputy O'Dea on bringing this motion before the House. However, it is a shame this issue was not a priority in the lead-up to the budget. Thus it did not feature in budget 2018. That is most regrettable. It is a missed opportunity, but not only on the part of the Government. Where was the Fianna Fáil voice when it was needed and could have made a difference for thousands of women in budget 2018? At last, this campaign, which has been championed by the National Women's Council of Ireland, Age Action Ireland and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, is gaining momentum. The Fianna Fáil intervention today, however belated, is still to be welcomed because it is never too late to do the right thing. It is better late than never. During the past week we have heard many Government politicians talk the talk about how unfair the current pension system is. Despite the candid admissions, there remains a deep reluctance on the part of Government to give any firm commitment to redress this issue effectively and fairly. The demands of these people, mostly women, are not unreasonable. They simply seek equality and justice, and they are right to insist on these. When discussing pension contributions, we should not forget the contribution these women have made to society. Their valuable contribution to society is clearly underappreciated and undervalued by this Government. The thousands of women who continue to be forgotten by this Government deserve more than recognition of their plight. They deserve so much more than words. They deserve equality.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíorshásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. This motion calls on the Government to exercise its powers under the Constitution to tackle this unprecedented crisis in housing and homelessness in our country. Yesterday the European Committee of Social Rights published a decision delivered in May of this year in the case of the International Federation of Human Rights v. Ireland, concluding that Ireland violated Article 16 of the Revised European Social Charter due to its "unsatisfactory protection against poverty and social exclusion of persons living in local authority housing estates". This is a damning indictment of our country. The case was taken in 2014 in respect of substandard State housing. What the decision really highlights is how the Government has failed the family unit, which is protected under Article 16 of the revised European Social Charter. It is not just in respect of substandard buildings that this Government fails the family unit. Children and families who are now homeless are suffering, and their health, well-being and education are being adversely affected. How many people must be homeless for the Government to recognise that this is an unprecedented emergency? Will it be the fact that there are now 3,000 children without a place to call home? Are 1,429 homeless families, a rise of 25% in the last year, not enough? We need homes for these families, not hubs. Surely it is way past time for the Government to declare a housing and homelessness emergency. The Green Party is happy to support this motion and commends Deputy Healy on bringing it before the House. The Government lacks vision and strategic planning when it comes to the scale of the housing and homelessness crisis which severely affects the most vulnerable in our society. It is time for the Government to view housing as a human right and one that must be enshrined within our Constitution. In the past four years there have been four Ministers with responsibility for housing. This is indicative of the Government's track record and shows the level of genuine intent, level of priority and respect for the role of this Ministry which is at the centre of the biggest crisis of our time. There has been no continuity, no stability and no appropriate demonstration from this Government of the level of priority and real action the crisis clearly and urgently needs. In the recent budget, in seeking to do a little for everyone, the Government ended up doing nothing significant for anyone. It did very little for some of the most vulnerable in our society, those who are without a home and those who are trying to deal with an unsustainable and unaffordable property market. These are people whom the State is failing and leaving on incredibly long housing lists or in an unaffordable housing market with skyrocketing house prices and forced to rent without any security of tenure. The recent announcement by the Government of its intention to increase the vacant site levy is to be welcomed. However, it is a shame that earlier this year, in February, when my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, introduced the Derelict and Vacant Sites Bill in the Seanad, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chose to vote against it. I welcome the Government's recognition now that this increase is needed, but it still demonstrates this Government's lack of ambition and its inability to do anything other than take minute steps to tackle big problems as this increase will not come into full force until at least 2019. The budget could have seen a shift to focusing on a cost-rental model of local authority building.Instead, the Government is continuing with its outdated logic that the private market alone can fix the crisis in housing and homelessness. In the words of former Chief Secretary in Dublin Castle, Thomas Drummond in 1838, "property has its duties as well as its rights". Our Constitution is quite strong in recognising property rights but it also recognises the need of the common good to be served, which must prioritise the needs of those most vulnerable in our society. Unfortunately, this Government does not seem to recognise or be willing to act on that fact. It is absolutely unacceptable that the lack of real action we have seen from the Government continues. The Green Party will support this motion to show that the Dáil not only recognises the scale of the problem but the urgent and pressing need to take immediate and effective action.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. Last Thursday's "RTÉ Investigates: Nightmare to Let" presented a stark and appalling reality of renting in Ireland in 2017. It was a shocking surprise to many but, to many others, it was not a surprise at all. To anyone who has been searching for a place to rent, renters who spend days, weeks, months and years searching for accommodation that is substandard and overpriced, this was only another cruel reminder of what is sometimes on offer. This is not only a question of quality of life. The conditions that we saw in the programme on Thursday clearly constituted serious threats to public health and the health and well-being of those living there. This is not an issue that has sprung up overnight. Five months ago, I tabled a motion in Dáil Éireann calling for a review and evaluation of our local authority building control sections, which are under-resourced and stretched too thin to have any substantive safety impact. Regrettably, there has been no change or movement from the Government since then. One in five people resides in private rental accommodation, yet we only have 65 employees in the building control sections of local authorities across the country. Local authorities have an inspection rate of 4% of all private rental properties listed on the RTB website for last year. That rate is mere tokenism and is not reassuring. It does not instil confidence. In fact, it can have the opposite effect and give a signal to rogue landlords that they and their death trap properties will not be detected and they will not be apprehended. Also, 69% of the relatively tiny 4% that were inspected failed the inspections. This would indicate that we may be dealing with the tip of the iceberg. I say "may" because of the worrying dearth of information gleaned to date. One would think that the 69% figure, with the recent RTÉ exposé, would trigger the Government into action and reassure the tens of thousands of renters. Alas, no. If landlords are not detected or among the 4% investigated, they will continue to have nothing to fear because the local authorities are simply not armed with anything like the necessary resources. The Government must institute an NCT-like system for certification for private rental accommodation. The overarching priority underpinning the provision of rented accommodation must be the safety of the residents. It is essential that we move from a reactive system based on dealing with complaints to a proactive system that polices.If landlords are not properly aware of the prospect of having their properties inspected and the prospect of heavy penalties for breaches, they will continue to let overcrowded, substandard accommodation because they know they can get away with it.  The Government must seek to introduce robust regulation to specifically tackle overcrowding. Threshold has stated this can be done by a ministerial regulation but the question to the Minister of State is: what evidence is there that this is being done as a matter of priority? The Government must also seek to tackle split incentive issues whereby investment in a property such as retrofitting is discouraged because the occupier and not the owner pays the energy bill. Therefore, there is no real incentive for owners to invest in their properties. This also provides a further disincentive for landlords to ensure that properties are warm, energy efficient, of good quality and well maintained. The Government might only have become aware of the situation since last Thursday but this is and has been the reality of daily life for many renters across Dublin and the country. The need for strict regulation and well-resourced regulators is an urgent matter of public safety in order to ensure the horrific conditions all Members saw last Thursday are not allowed to continue. Inept token regulation should not ever be tolerated. We must place the health and safety of the tens of thousands of people who rent to the front and centre in proper regulation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas go mór i gcoinne an Bhille seo mar is léir don dall go mbeidh impleachtaí gan aon mhaith ag eiceolaíocht na hÉireann agus cruthóidh an Bille seo slad mór milltineach ar oidhreacht nadúrtha na tíre. Just as my party colleague, Senator Grace O’Sullivan, opposed this Bill when it was before the Seanad, the Green Party will oppose it here. As far as the Green Party and the green movement is concerned, this legislation is anti-heritage and should be assigned to the scrap heap. Despite the hard work and justified concerns of many legislators from varied political backgrounds who vehemently opposed this Bill, the Minister persists on her mission to destroy our heritage. I am taken aback that this Government and the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, would call on us to sanction the destruction of our beautiful habitats, our indigenous wildlife and our natural heritage. I was hoping, more than expecting, that the wild fires which raged out of control over the past year would have woken up this Government and the heritage Minister to the scale, urgency and gravity of the problem. Upland areas across the nation have been set alight. We have watched in horror throughout this year as over 1,500 ha of forestry and 2,000 ha of bogland were devastated by fire in Connemara, as the lake at Gougánbarra glowed with the reflection of roaring flames. The fires have roared even closer to home in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown in Ticknock. In just under two months, from 24 March to 22 May of this year, the Irish Wildlife Trust recorded 97 illegal wildfires in rural areas. Some 39 of these were in special conservation areas which are protected by EU habitats legislation. The current law and the penalties or sanctions imposed on those convicted of such destructive vandalism fail abysmally to protect Ireland’s heritage. However, instead of putting in place real disincentives, carrying out a real investigation into what happened and providing appropriate support to those affected by the forest infernos, the Minister’s sole response appears to be a determination to pass this anti-heritage slash and burn legislation. Those who have helped destroy our forests can rest peacefully in their beds, knowing that this heritage Minister is not pursuing them for causing millions of euro of heritage destruction, and she is not putting in place emergency legislation or even an investigation to assure the hundreds of thousands of people who care about our heritage that those arsonists will face the full rigours of the law. This has been a golden but clearly missed opportunity for the Minister to leave a real positive protective mark. Instead with this Bill she has chosen to travel in the opposite direction, fuelling the flames. Currently upland burnings are restricted to the period from the start of September to the end of February. We should be working tirelessly to ensure that strictly controlled fires take place solely within this timeframe. Instead, with wanton disregard to both wildlife and public safety the Minister seeks to extend this inherently dangerous burning period, to enshrine in law the destruction of Ireland’s nature. I congratulate the Minister. Coming so fast on the heels of her recent decision to designate 46 of our prehistoric raised bogs as natural heritage areas, not to mention their obliteration as having any further benefit as crucial carbon sinks, it assures only one thing: that her heritage legacy will reap havoc for not just this generation or the next generations but for generations to come.  Burning outside of the current season jeopardises a vast array of wildlife. For many birds, such as the endangered curlew whose population is in decline, March is a month of nesting. This is the time when they establish their territories, create their nests and prepare for laying their eggs. Curlews are facing global extinction. Alex Copland of BirdWatch Ireland has said that there are only 125 pairs of curlews left in Ireland and that the Minister’s proposed change in the rules would be the last straw for curlews, that there would be too few left and they would die out. Fires at this time can eradicate future breeding and decimate already declining populations. It is saddening that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, shows such scant regard for these creatures. However, I am delighted that it is not only the Green Party that sees this Bill for what it is. As long as protecting the environment is seen as the party policy concern and preserve of only one party nothing effective can happen. It is incumbent on us all, party and non-party, to protect our environment, to fight for it and to call out lazy, destructive pandering to a few who have no regard for the huge and far-reaching destructive consequences of such damaging legislation. We need courageous leadership to face down vested interests in order to protect our heritage. Extending the burning season is not leadership. To put it in simple terms it is environmental sabotage. The Minister does not seem content at destroying our uplands. She is also hell bent on attacking our hedgerows and the wealth of wildlife to which they are home. Our hedgerows act as linear forestry in Ireland. They provide feeding for birds, insects and mammals. They are integral to biodiversity, pollination, nesting and future feeding. Bumble bees and wild honey bees will also suffer by extending the permitted times to slash and cut down vegetation and flowering wild plants. The president of the Irish Beekeepers Association, Gerry Ryan, has said that:allowing the destruction of vegetation in August would be devastating for Ireland’s bees. Clover and blackberries are still in flower. The bumble bees and honey bees need these blossoms and flowering ivy to build themselves up to survive the winter.My colleague, Senator Grace O’Sullivan, with great cross-party and non-party support in the Seanad, challenged the extension by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, of hedge-cutting season. After weeks of debate on the matter in the Seanad, the Minister slipped in an insidious amendment at the 11th hour. I congratulate the Minister and give her ten out of ten for consistency. This convoluted amendment effectively overrides all the work done by the Seanad to protect our environment and goes so far as to undermine the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.This Act stipulated strong oversight of any hedge cutting that takes place during nesting seasons on the grounds of health and safety. The Minister’s amendment, however, appears to remove this oversight, encouraging and ensuring that hedge cutting which is destructive to our environment will be a near free-for-all. It provides for no real monitoring and no disincentives for law breakers intent on wrecking and ruining nature. What about the concerns about the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill? Was that scrutiny performed when the Bill was under consideration by the last Government? Has the Attorney General been asked to review the legislation in light of the amendments made on Report Stage in the Seanad? These are questions which need to be answered. Was the Attorney General satisfied that the provisions of the Bill, and in particular those contained in section 8, would be in compliance with the strategic environmental assessment directive and the birds and the habitats directives? My party and I call on the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to withdraw this Bill but I realise that my pleas, and the pleas of so many others who are not aligned at all to the Green Party, may fall on obstinately deaf ears. It seems as though the Minister is impervious to the criticisms of this Bill. It seems she is blind or immune to the destruction it will wreak on our countryside. It seems that, despite her ironic job title as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, she is anything but pro-heritage. I regret to say she has demonstrated no care for the heritage of our nation.  The question for members of Fianna Fáil, therefore, is whether we can rely on them to help quash this Bill once and for all. Fianna Fáil has a real opportunity to be a party of Opposition. It has an opportunity to hold this Government to account and to safeguard and protect the future of the Irish countryside. I call on Fianna Fáil to seize that opportunity and to do right by this nation. The Fianna Fáil Party can, if it so desires, remove itself from the shackles of supply and confidence, as this has nothing to do with the supply and confidence deal and therefore it is free to do the right thing. In fact let us all, as Members of this House, set party politics aside and unite in opposition to this Bill in order to secure our nation’s natural beauty for the generations to come. Let new politics give this Government a deserved political bloody nose by binning its proposed charter to destroy our environment. We must stop this Bill in its tracks because the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is on a mission to destroy our heritage. She is a Minister for heritage who has only shown disregard and disrespect to our heritage, our wildlife and our biodiversity. With this Bill she holds the match with which she will set our country’s wildlife aflame. Mo náire thú.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill before the House this evening is a missed opportunity to strive towards one of the most important underlying principles of fairness and justice in our society, the principle of equal pay for equal work. It is a fundamental undermining of this principle that any person should be paid considerably less for doing the same job simply because they started work after a certain date. This multi-tiered system, which results in some public servants earning as much as 20% less than colleagues, should be abolished as soon as possible so all public servants can be paid the same for the same work. It is equal pay for equal work. How many times need we say this to the Government but it still refuses to commit to that principle? Not only does the Bill completely avoid addressing this basic inequality but it also applies punitive measures to those who have not signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA, 2018-2020. It is on that basis that the Green Party will oppose sections 21 and 33 this evening. Section 21 would suspend the awarding of increments to members of trade unions or staff associations that have not notified the Workplace Relations Commission that they agree to be bound by the PSSA. These members are defined in section 3 as non-covered public servants. They will not receive any benefits of the agreement from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. To incentivise sign-up to the PSSA, section 21 provides for less favourable terms for public servants not covered by the PSSA between 2018 and 2020. These include slower pay restoration, with each increase taking place nine months later than the scheduled pay increase, and the suspension of incremental increases up to the end of 2020. Meanwhile, section 33 of the Bill requires non-covered public servants to start giving pension contributions from a lower wage threshold than anyone else. Given the number of young and new teachers in this country, it is of no surprise that it is among the teacher unions that the PSSA has been roundly rejected. Tá riachtanas ann go léireofar meas ar ár múinteoirí óga agus nua-cáilithe sa tír seo. Cad is fiú dóibh a bheith ina seasamh os comhair ranga má tá an múinteoir béal dorais leo i dteideal pá níos airde ná iad. Caithfear luach a gcuid saothair a thabhairt dóibh luath nó mall. The teaching profession in our country is being devalued and this will have a detrimental impact on the quality of education in Ireland. Our younger teachers play a vital role in the future direction of education and they are highly skilled and specialised classroom practitioners, entrusted on a daily basis with major and far-reaching responsibility. By allowing differential pay scales to continue, we are telling our teachers that they do not matter and we do not care. That is simply not good enough. They will leave our shores if this continues. At some stage in the near future will this Government please commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work? Do it now. The Green Party will oppose this section.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I spoke earlier about this matter when I was speaking to section 21. The Green Party opposes section 33. It requires public servants who are not covered by the pay agreement, as defined in section 3, to start making pension contributions at a lower wage threshold than everyone else. Táimid go mór i gcoinne é seo.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The housing capital budget under Rebuilding Ireland for 2017 was last week increased by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, by €100 million to €1.4 billion. However, an answer to a recent parliamentary question confirmed that the total spend on additional social homes from all sources since 1 July 2016, in the form of acquisitions, Part V, local authority builds and approved housing body builds, was €583 million. This would indicate that only approximately €500 million has been spent out of €1.4 billion for building and acquiring new units in 2017. Can the Tánaiste tell the House where the remaining almost €1 billion is going? In June this year, in a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister, Deputy Murphy, pledged that 2,284 units would be delivered in 2017. I have gone through the quarterly report for Rebuilding Ireland, which was published last week, to identify every single unit which was completed or site-finished in the first three quarters of 2017 and it is clear that only 809 units of the 2,284 have been completed. In the UK the quantity spent on rental assistance is about five times that of the housing capital budget. As the Government here is clearly not building enough houses, is it the Government's intention to move further towards the UK model? If it is, there are serious health warnings. There is no point drifting towards an entirely rental-oriented approach to housing when, at present, fixity of tenure is completely inadequate and when a lack of inspection or an enforceable standards regime results in the horrific living conditions we saw on "Prime Time" last month. The fact that one in three tenancies in the State is financially rent assisted is just adding pressure to further rent increases for all, making Dublin simply an unattainable place to buy or rent. I am concerned about the inept governmental policy response to date. The incoherence of all this policy implies that what may have happened is that Rebuilding Ireland, launched last year, was rapidly abandoned as a plan by departmental officials without them telling the Tánaiste or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The Tánaiste is now defending a plan which is not there or, if it is, is certainly not working. Where is the €1 billion going? Given the new numbers, why can the Tánaiste not accept that Rebuilding Ireland is not succeeding and will not succeed in effectively tackling the housing crisis?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is hard to believe the figures the Tánaiste is giving for next year when the figures the Government has given for this year show that, of a target of 2,284 houses, only 809 were delivered. There is a huge disconnect between the narrative and reality. The harsh reality is that 8,000 people are homeless. The tragic reality is that 3,000 of them are children and the stark objective reality is that Rebuilding Ireland simply is not working. There were only 809 builds in 2017, of which 303 were direct local authority builds in 18 different authorities, meaning 13 local authorities did not complete a single house in 2017. Of the 98 completions in Dublin, 76 were rapid builds for families on the increasing homeless list, which leaves a grand total of 22 units in the greater Dublin area for a waiting list of 40,000 people. How is the capital housing budget being adequately spent if the greater Dublin area only saw 22 units built in the first nine months of this year? It is time to think outside the box and for the Government to accept that Rebuilding Ireland is not working. This is an emergency and a crisis. Surely an objective analysis of the Government's response should be results-driven. The results speak for themselves and they are appalling. It is time for a new direction and a new plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not working.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There were 22 completions. That is a fact.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 9, to delete lines 26 to 28 and substitute the following:" "student union", in relation to an institute or technological university, means an independent body established by students, with a written constitution ratified by students in a referendum to promote the general interests of students of an institute or technological university and which represents students, both individually and collectively, in respect of academic, disciplinary and other matters arising within the university;".This amendment provides a definition of a student union as an independent body democratically elected by students for students. The Bill's current definition of student union bizarrely allows the technological university to define any student representative body whether it is democratically elected or not. Obviously there are huge concerns and I have met numerous students' unions about this. The Bill also requires the union to be recognised by the technological university before it can be defined as a student union. My proposed amendment defines a student union as an independent body democratically elected by the students for the students. It requires that a representative group for students should not have to rely on a TU to recognise it, but on the students who recognise it by voting for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I reiterate what my colleagues said and thank them for speaking in support of my amendment. As it stands, the Bill would lead to the oxymoronic situation where a group would be defined as representing students because the technological university states that and recognises it but an independent body established by students and whose members are democratically elected by students would not be considered representative. We need to strive to protect the students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not accept that. The amendment is needed to protect the students' union as an independent body democratically elected by the students. We cannot allow a situation in which it depends on the technological university to recognise it and have no regard to the fact it can be democratically elected by the students for the students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 13: "In page 13, line 9, to delete "where practicable" and substitute "in so far as possible".Amendment No. 13 seeks to delete "where practicable" and insert "in so far as possible" in its place when it comes to critical thinking and diversity in technological university education. I believe this would strengthen the commitment of the university to contribute to the promotion of the economic, cultural and social development of the State, to respect diversity of value, beliefs, traditions and all other aims listed in subsection 1(K)(iii). It seeks to bring the language of section 9(1)(k)(iii) into line with the language in section 9(1)(h)(ii). I raised this issue at Committee Stage and I would like to thank the Minister. She gave a commitment to engage with me and she did, as did her officials, and I thank her for doing that so constructively. Our amendment simply seeks to ensure that life-enhancing skills, such as analytical, critical thinking and diverse views, are protected and promoted as part of the university experience have a role in wider society. Amendment No. 15, by deleting "or" and substituting "and" in line three of page 14, will ensure that in the formulation of procedures for dispute resolution the technological university must consult with every trade union and staff association recognised by the university.This just tightens up the current language which leaves open the possibility that the technological university could consult with a trade union without consulting the staff association.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 14, line 3, to delete “or” and substitute “and”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 16 will ensure that both students and staff will have their academic freedom protected. This is especially important for doctoral students, who are working on the cutting edge of scientific, cultural, social and technological development and who should feel free from discrimination or pressure to conform. Universities are about more than jobs. They are also about creating hubs for the development of innovative ideas and concepts which advance our world and culture as a whole. International recognition is also more likely to come to a university if it does not put a brain freeze on its students and academics.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíorshásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille tábhachtach seo. Ar dtús, I acknowledge and welcome the members of the Irish deaf community to the Gallery, including their interpreters and supporters who have campaigned so long for the recognition of Irish Sign Language. I commend Senator Mark Daly, who is with us this evening, on introducing the Bill in the Seanad. He took the initiative, ran with it and secured the support necessary to bring it before the Dáil. This is an important Bill and today is an important day on which we take a crucial step to recognise the basic right to communicate of more than 5,000 members of the Irish deaf community. As a councillor in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown in 2015, I received a letter from a constituent called Wendy Murray who was then the chairperson of the Irish Deaf Society. She asked me to table a motion before the council and I was delighted to do so. It received unanimous support. As has happened here today, each councillor spoke loudly and clearly in turn in support of the motion. It is a privilege to stand in the House and speak to the Bill which seeks to make that recognition a reality. The Irish Deaf Society has stated that the failure to recognise Irish Sign Language by the State puts the health and well-being of deaf people at risk as they often struggle to avail of vital health and educational services. Many of the private and public services so many of us take for granted are inaccessible to deaf people. It is essential that public bodies be required to provide the necessary interpretive services for deaf people. I cannot even begin to contemplate how frustrating it must be for a person who is deaf to engage with a public body. I refer to simple, daily acts I take for granted like contacting a local authority or departmental office which becomes increasingly frustrating for those who are deaf because there is no one on the other side of the counter who can interpret or communicate with them. Irish Sign Language gives thousands of Irish people the invaluable gift of communication. The Irish Deaf Society has campaigned for more than 30 years to have Irish Sign Language officially recognised to ensure equality for deaf people. All those people want is to secure the right to full participation as citizens. The availability of services and information, as guaranteed by law, is the only means to ensure that deaf people have the opportunity to access and participate fully in society. I welcome the Bill, which seeks to ensure that members of the deaf community can participate fully as citizens by legally guaranteeing the right to access information in what is their first, and for so many, only language. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, is happy to support the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a terrible tragedy that we are approaching Christmas in Ireland in 2017 but, as of September 2017, more than 3,000 children are homeless throughout the country. More than 8,000 people of every age are without a home. These figures have been going up. By the summer of this year, the figures had increased by 25% over last year. This is happening year on year. Between December 2014 and August 2017, there was a net increase of 5,412 in the number of people recorded as homeless, representing an increase of 189%. In March 2017, a total of 77 families presented as homeless to services in the Dublin region. In 2016, the average number of families becoming homeless each month was 85. It should be kept in mind that homelessness figures do not include people sleeping rough, people in direct provision or people in domestic violence centres that are overcrowded as well as many EU or non-EU migrants who cannot prove centres of residence. The tenth report of the Government special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, was released only last week on 7 December. He noted criticism by UN human rights bodies of Ireland's handling of the crisis in child homelessness in a way that infringes numerous rights of children, including the right to play, the right to adequate accommodation and the right to family life. These are infringements of the principle of the best interests of the child and the right of a child to life survival and development. In particular, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that social housing units should be increased and that Ireland must tackle homelessness adequately. Beforehand, on 2 October 2017, Dr. Shannon had criticised State inaction on child homelessness. He said children are not passive spectators but are deeply affected by the impact of homelessness. He said emergency accommodation deprived children of the right to achieve their full potential and compromises their ability to grow and develop. Dr. Shannon said several rights were affected by the problem of homelessness. He said children's education is compromised, their ability to play is reduced and their physical and emotional well-being is damaged. The crisis in child homelessness in this country is a fundamental human rights issue. It is truly time for the Government to view housing as a human right to be enshrined in the Constitution. The question of standards in emergency accommodation is another major issue. Peter McVerry has highlighted that emergency accommodation has no standards or inspections and that it is always shared. This leaves children exposed to violence, drug-taking and a severe lack of standards in health and cleanliness. This was exposed by thejournal.ie earlier this year. Grainia Long, chief executive of the ISPCC, told thejournal.ie in 2016 that children's human rights are being breached in several areas in respect of the use of hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation as emergency accommodation. In May this year, UNICEF Ireland described as a total failure of State the shocking reports that 12 families, including 30 children, were left with no option but to present themselves at Garda stations because they had nowhere to sleep. Homeless hubs are being introduced as a means of moving families out of bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels, but they have been heavily criticised by experts. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has described the approach as trying to normalise homelessness, institutionalising families and infringing the right to private and family life and dignity. A recent report from Maynooth University on homeless hubs shows the damage they do to children's mental health, the structure of the family, privacy and autonomy. The report also shows that the Government policy of relying on the private rental sector, hubs and emergency accommodation from 2009 to 2015 has cost the State 31,136 directly built social homes. There is a homelessness crisis now. There are more than 180,000 vacant dwellings in the State now. There is no time to wait on this issue. At the heart of this crisis is a broken housing system, a system dominated, unfortunately, by Government spin and not, regrettably, by building houses.I raised this matter with the Tánaiste yesterday on Leaders' Questions, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned. When I raised the reality of the figures for the number of houses being built, the Tánaiste said my statistics were "simply not true". I stand over my figures and the irony is my numbers were taken from those of the Department. The figures I gave yesterday have again been confirmed by independent experts. I will read them into the record as it is important to put a spotlight on this constant Government spin. Of a target of 2,284 houses that were meant to be built or completed this year, only 809 were delivered. Of these, 303 were direct local authority builds in 18 different authorities, meaning 13 local authorities did not complete a single house in 2017. Of the 98 completions in Dublin, 76 were rapid builds for families on the increasing homeless lists, which leaves a grand total of 22 units in the greater Dublin area for a waiting list of over 40,000 people. As I said to the Tánaiste yesterday, surely an objective analysis of the Government's analysis would be results-driven but the results speak for themselves because they are appalling. Independent experts have backed me up and indicated they stand over those figures. Perhaps, due to the magnitude and seriousness of this emergency housing crisis, the Government should be afforded an opportunity to correct the record. Not doing so would bring a further lack of confidence and worry in the victims of this crisis, who have been left speechless, as well as upset, that the Government simply does not even have a handle on figures.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The humane and compassionate response from the Government should be at the very least to give accurate, reliable statistics. I plead with the Government to stop the spin and tackle this crisis once and for all. Start building. Agus muid ag smaoineamh ar choinneal a lasadh san fhuinneog ar Oíche Nollag na bliana 2017 is scannalach an rud é go bhfuil 3,000 páiste ag fanacht in ostáin. Mar mhúinteoir, mar mháthair agus mar Theachta Dála, táim an-bhuartha faoi thodhchaí agus meabhairshláinte na bpáistí seo. Ní mór cur le chéile ar bhonn tras-pháirtí agus brú a chur ar an Rialtas níos mó a dhéanamh ar son páisti uilig an náisiúin. Caithfear níos mó infheistíochta, ama agus airgid a thabhairt ar an gceist seo go práinneach. How many children must be homeless for this Government to recognise that this is an unprecedented emergency? The Government lacks vision and strategic planning when it comes to the scale of the housing and homelessness crisis, which severely affects the most vulnerable in our society. The homelessness issue is complex and there is a large number of variables and perspectives that the Government needs to take into account to tackle it. However, it is absolutely unacceptable that we have seen a lack of real action and continuity of spin from the Government. It is not right on any level. How can it be right for the 3,000 children without a home this Christmas? The most basic human rights of the children of our country must be guaranteed as a matter of absolute priority.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When does the Government intend to deal with the urgent need for State assistance for homeowners residing in defective buildings? Such assistance was recommended by the report of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last week, entitled Safe as Houses? Moreover, as the Taoiseach is aware, similar assistance was recommended in a motion brought forward by the Green Party and passed by the House last June. I am aware of at least three multi-unit developments in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown where residents, through absolutely no fault of their own, are facing repair and building works bills of between €7,000 and €30,000. Some are facing the threat of legal proceedings for the amounts, which it is claimed they owe. It is so unfair. These homeowners and families believe their nightmare and plight is being ignored and forgotten. They believe the Government does not care about their horrendous predicament and they are desperately looking to Government and seeking help, protection and assistance. When does the Government intend to tackle this protracted problem effectively? Does the Government intend to implement practical measures such as tax relief for these homeowners? Does the Government intend to set up a redress scheme for such homeowners, as identified in the committee report last week?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is mór an onóir dom í mar bhean agus mar Theachta Dála bheith anseo anocht agus muid ag tabhairt ómóis do mhná na hÉireann agus gluaiseacht na sufraigéide ón gcéad seo caite. Táimid go mór faoi chomaoin dóibh as a gcuid iarrachtaí, a ghnóthaigh cearta vótála do gach bean in Éirinn, agus gabhaimid buíochas leo. As women, our right to vote was hard-fought-for and hard-won. Today we remember, not that 100 years ago we were granted the right to vote but rather that 100 years ago our grandmothers and great-grandmothers demanded our right to vote. As one part of a greater struggle for social justice, they demanded that our right as women to engage in public life and play full part in society would be respected and vindicated by all. The suffrage that we celebrate today was not something that was given to us. It was achieved through great sacrifice, unapologetically and with absolute conviction by our foremothers asserting our self-evident and inalienable rights as women. As we face obstacles, discrimination and inequalities that are severe, that are challenging and that at times seem insurmountable, we must take strength, hope and inspiration from the battles won by those women who came before us. The challenges they faced were overwhelming, and yet they persisted and they overcame. We owe it to these women who sacrificed, who suffered and who lost so much – some losing their lives – to continue to fight, and to continue to overcome. The Ireland of tomorrow will be shaped by the women of today, by our children and by our grandchildren. We will continue to speak and we will be heard. We, the women of the whole island of Ireland, mná na hÉireann - mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers and granddaughters – will continue to speak up, continue to build, continue to foster and continue to inspire. The most appropriate way of honouring these brave and courageous campaigning women of yesteryear is to continue the fight for full equality for women at home and abroad. While clearly great and historic strides were made by the suffragettes, they would expect nothing less from us. They would want us to take and win the next steps in the battles of equality, to take strength from their achievement, and to go from strength to strength to continue the fight. That is the best way to honour their memory, their courage and their monumental achievement at that time.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Page 134 of the programme for Government refers to the completion of the Luas cross-city line and states "[a] decent public transport system is essential to the everyday lives of so many citizens". That is undoubtedly true, but, with the opening of the new cross-city Luas line, the green line has gone overnight from being a very reliable to an unpredictable and unreliable commuter service for many of my constituents in Dublin-Rathdown. What short and long-term measures will the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport take to tackle capacity issues, erratic scheduling and the issue of delayed trams which are frustrating commuters daily. The Minister referenced these issues in the House last month as "teething problems" but the problems grow day by day. When will the Minister's infancy period end? The problems seem to be avoidable and signal, as usual, a lack of proper planning and joined-up thinking in the expansion of the green line, which is to be warmly welcomed. I realise the full roll-out of trams with greater capacity is to happen soon, but it will not fix all of the issues with the Luas.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The 2010 national pension framework stated people should be confident and secure about their expectations on retirement. The Government has committed to reforming the State pension system from 2020 onwards.Yesterday, I received an answer to a parliamentary question on this issue which states that the proposal will not be finalised until after a public consultation later this year. While I welcome the public consultation on this matter, there is much uncertainty around exactly what these changes will entail. If these changes are only finalised at the end of the 2018 or in 2019 and they are due to take effect in 2020, this leaves very little time for anybody to prepare for retirement, especially given that mandatory retirement age is still legal in Irish employment contracts. What does the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection intend to do for the first generation of pensioners from 2020 onwards so that they can plan ahead for these changes and will not be faced with significant shortfalls in their pension expectations with little or no time to adjust?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The week before last, on promised legislation, I raised the plight of homeowners residing in defective buildings and their urgent need for State assistance. Their situation is so worrying - in some developments it is escalating - that I must raise it again today. I recently met with homeowners in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown who have received their first bills for remedial works that are only necessary as a result of poor construction. Along with these substantial bills came the pre-emptive threat of legal proceedings being instituted if bills are not paid by a specific deadline. Recently, they have received follow-up warning letters threatening that they will be hauled before the courts of justice if they do not pay. In the latest sickening phase of their plight they are being pushed up against the wall and asked to pay the price for the greed and incompetence of reckless builders who built dangerous, shoddy homes, unmonitored by an indifferent State. Last summer the Dáil passed a Green Party motion calling on the Government to regulate the construction industry and institute a redress scheme for such homeowners. Last month the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published a report which called for a redress scheme for such homeowners. Yet, instead of rising to and responding to these calls, the Government has done nothing. These homeowners feel alone and abandoned and the Government does nothing to assist them. These are not buy-to-let properties or speculative properties: these are their homes. This poor building happened under the State's watch with little or no substantive regulation, certification or supervision. The Government simply cannot wash its hands of this issue. Practical, reasonable measures which could ease the burden on homeowners include relief on property tax, relief on income tax for works to be carried out, creating a loan fund for those who cannot pay and VAT relief along the lines of the home renovation initiative. What will the Taoiseach do to assist these homeowners who are in desperate need of help? Will he enact a comprehensive legal reform to create new remedies for victims of poor building practices? This problem will not go away. The remedies simply are not there and the Government must take action to create them. The Dáil has called for that, the joint Oireachtas committee has called for that and homeowners across the length and breadth of our country are calling for that. How much longer will the Government remain silent? When will the Government do something constructive and effective to help these homeowners?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Taoiseach mentioned the 2014 regulations but what about homes built before 2014? Are homeowners who bought prior to 2014 to be cast aside and forgotten? What about homeowners who have exhausted all legal remedies and who now need some form of State assistance. They are facing bills of up to €30,000. In the past, the State intervened in respect of private contracts in circumstances such as this. Priory Hall set such a precedent. Furthermore, the Government gives tax reliefs to land hoarders and speculators, to the construction industry and developers, but it has nothing for these people. They are simply asking for some practical assistance and some recognition from the State that they will not have to face this nightmare entirely alone. I have written to the Minister asking him to meet some of the homeowners but I have yet to receive a reply. Will the Taoiseach meet them in order to hear, at first hand, about their ongoing stress, anxiety, worries and fears. Perhaps then the uncertain futures which they face, and the need for intervention and support would become abundantly clear to the Taoiseach.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have rural and Dublin roots.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am happy to be living in Dublin for the last 25 years. Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíor-shásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. In recent months, commuters in the constituency of Dublin Rathdown, a constituency the Minister represents too, have been continually frustrated by the Luas green line which has overnight gone from a consistent, reliable service into one which commuters can no longer currently depend on. In recent days and weeks, I have been flooded with complaints from constituents who are exasperated with the current quality of the Luas service. I can only assume the Minister is receiving similar emails and phone calls. Commuting at peak times is a nightmare for Luas passengers due to overcrowding resulting from inappropriate capacities, delays and the repeated failures and malfunctioning of the real-time information displays and debit card machines. Some of the technical failures have been resolved today but the substantive problem persists, namely, there are not enough trams and for the pressing demand, the trams simply do not arrive frequently enough. This is not to mention accessibility issues for commuters, with the lifts at Dundrum and Connolly stations consistently out of service in recent weeks. We have also witnessed an entirely unacceptable lack of communication between the Luas operators and passengers. Passengers are the lifeblood of the service and should be treated with an appropriate level of professionalism and courtesy. They should not be taken for granted. At the weekend, I was contacted by constituents who told me of an instance on Sunday where passengers on the Luas green line travelling into the city centre were given no advance warning of having to disembark at the Luas stop at Cowper. That problem at Cowper did not occur suddenly and the authorities had adequate time to warn passengers travelling on that line, but failed to do so. Cowper is not an isolated example. This caused distress for many of the passengers, particularly several elderly and less mobile passengers, who were stranded halfway between their starting point and their destination. This simply is not good enough. The Minister referenced these issues in the House as "teething problems", but the problems grow day by day. When will this teething period end? Yesterday I called for Transdev to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport to explain the poor service in recent weeks and to find out what is needed to restore the reliability of Luas services. I welcome the fact that the chair of the committee has indicated that he would be happy with this suggestion. I would also call on the committee to consider calling other stakeholders in, including the Minister, officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Dublin City Council officials to outline the measures being taken to ease the current pressures on the Luas lines. The problems faced by commuters on a daily basis have shown an unacceptable lack of preparation on the part of the Government in the roll-out of the Luas cross city. It has shown a distinct lack of proper and thorough forward planning and joined-up thinking. While I welcome the publication of the Project Ireland 2040 plan, and its commitment to planning ahead, there are real concerns about where the emphasis is placed in terms of transport investment and the lack of detail in the document. The bulk of planned transport investment is still set to go on inter-urban roads and by doing so, the Government is committing a generation to longer commute times and urban sprawl. While the long-delayed Dublin metro and light-rail plans for Cork are to be warmly welcomed, they will not be enough on their own and the details for public transport in Cork city are non-existent. Dublin needs the DART underground, real investment in cycling infrastructure and an upgraded bus network to avoid being crippled by traffic gridlock. Galway, Limerick and Waterford need similar radical transport plans if they are to be able to grow. However, in the here and now, and into the medium term and long term, the capacity issues with the Luas green line will not go away. With the Cherrywood development bringing at least 3,000 new homes at the end of the current line, and further developments along the Ballyogan Road, we need to be planning now for an increase in Luas capacity which will be needed not too far into the future. There is no evidence of this planning. I emphasise that the Luas service is vital to the daily life of so many. Commuters do not want an analysis of recent Irish political history, especially not a jaundiced one, on so many occasions when the Minister is asked in this House to respond to and account for many transport concerns. With respect, all commuters care about is tomorrow and the next day and they would really appreciate knowing how reliable the service will be. As a new Deputy to this Dáil, I want the same. Commuters do not want what they perceive as evasive comments or party political distractions. I repeat it is about how reliable the service will be tomorrow and into the future, what is being done and what precise concrete assurances and detail the Minister can give commuters tonight that they can rely on the Luas to get to their job on time and home to their families in the evening on time. As it stands, the faith and confidence of commuters need to be immediately restored as a matter of priority, and I call on Deputy Ross, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to deal with this. Working, efficient, reliable public transport lines are essential to our working and functioning properly and effectively as a city. This is an essential part of reducing our carbon emissions and making Dublin a more liveable city and these issues need to be sorted out as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am sharing my time with Deputy Eamon Ryan. We have still not received a copy of the Minister of State's speech even though many Members requested it at the beginning of the debate. Once again we debate in this Dáil this Government's most tragic failure - its ongoing inability to deal with an unprecedented housing and homelessness crisis. There are today more than 9,000 people homeless in the State. More than 3,000 of those are children. The numbers suffering on our streets and in emergency accommodation are only going up. The Government, in its isolated wisdom, feels it can tackle the crisis by, among other revolutionary, ground-breaking initiatives, granting tax breaks to developers and paying hundreds of millions of euro to private landlords in rent assistance without requiring fair fixity of tenure for tenants, let alone improving rental living standards and conditions. Where is the equity in all this? These initiatives are not working. It is certainly the definition of futility that the Government continually adopts the same methods and narrow-minded approach time and again to fix the crisis as the numbers of individuals, families and children who become homeless continue to grow. The Government simply does not have the vision or strategy to deal with this crisis. Every day, more people are suffering as a consequence. The Government's approach is not working. We need immediate, effective action. We need new ideas and new thinking outside the box, and then we need to implement the new proposals, not the same old, same old. The Green Party motion calls on the Government to tackle one of the foremost and fundamental challenges associated with our housing crisis, housing supply, by taking the responsibility to build more houses into its own hands. The motion provides a clear and practical model for doing so, one that is used in many other European countries. The State needs public rental housing stock of its own to ward off the problems that the private-market, subsidies-oriented approach brings with it. Public cost-rental housing provides security of tenure and affordable rents for tenants of all incomes. We can build these houses off-balance sheet, borrowing against future rental income. This is an investment in our future, our children and our children's families. The 34 acres of land at the site of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is in my constituency, Dublin Rathdown, will be perfect for an affordable, State-owned, cost-rental alternative for families who are priced out of the areas in which they grew up. This is once the facility is relocated to Portrane. House prices in my constituency have doubled in the past six years. We are identifying effective, identifiable and practical steps that the Government needs to take. I urge every Deputy in the House to support our motion. I urge the Government to take these ideas to heart and do so with the appropriately extreme sense of urgency needed. Mar a léirigh mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Eamon Ryan, roimhe seo, táimid ag moladh sa rún seo go dtógfar tithe agus árasáin d'ardchaighdeán ar thalún an Stáit ionas go mbeidh daoine in ann cíos réasúnta réalaíoch a íoc le haghaidh a gcuid lóistín. Tá a macasamhail á dhéanamh faoi láthair sa Danmhairg, san Ostair agus san Ollainn. Níl fáth ar bith nach féidir linn é seo a dhéanamh in Éirinn. If the Government is truly honest about this issue, it will admit that its approach is not working. It has been adopting it for seven years and it is not working. I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has not been in his portfolio for seven years but the Government has. The approach has not been markedly different since the Minister took office. Therefore, in order to make progress on and ultimately resolve the problem once and for all, the Government must first wake up, be very candid and accept its approach is not working. The statistics speak for themselves. For how much longer, over a prolonged period, must the Government insist upon continuing to implement failed policy - a tried, tested and failed policy? This is not a vanity project and it is not about who is right or wrong. The overarching concern - the only concern - is to tackle this unprecedented crisis head on. The National Economic and Social Council is recommending the cost-rental approach. The Nevin Economic Research Institute is recommending this approach. Social Justice Ireland is recommending this approach. Will the Government admit a new approach is needed, follow the experts, take on board the view of the stakeholders and abandon, here and now, not just a failing policy, but also a failed response? All the Deputies in this House want a constructive solution to our housing crisis. For that to happen, the Government first needs to realise it must change its approach. It needs to change its way of thinking. Our cost-rental motion is a start in that regard. I urge every Deputy to support it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Nuair a labhraíonn tú i nGaeilge go poiblí, léiríonn tú don domhan go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo mar theanga Ghaelach, Eorpach, Cheilteach agus nuálach feasta. Tá Gaelscoileanna ar fud an oileáin seo, ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Béal Feirste, ó Dhún na nGall go dtí An Daingean agus tá cultúr na nGael faoi bhláth. Ach, agus muid ag céiliúradh Bhliain na Gaeilge - is í seo seachtain na Gaeilge - ní mór dúinn mar pholaiteoirí ár n-aird a dhíriú ar staid na Gaeltachta. Is í an fhírinne ná go bhfuil bánú á dhéanamh ar cheantair Ghaeltachta. Gan deiseanna fostaíochta do mhuintir Ghaoth Dobhair agus Chonamara, ní bhíonn de rogha ag daoine ach slán a fhágáil le saol a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht agus clann a thógáil ann. Is cuimhin linn manna Barack Obama, "Is féidir linn". Tá ceist agam don Taoiseach. An féidir leat? An féidir leis ceannaireacht a léiriú maidir le riachtanais na Gaeltachta? Carpe diem - téigh chuig-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----Rosmuc, na hoileáin, Dún Chaoin agus Gaoth Dobhair agus bíodh comhrá agat féin le pobal na Gaeltachta.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ar an gcéad dul síos guím Lá Idirnáisiúnta na mBan shona daoibh go léir. Tá maoiniú d’Fhoras na Gaeilge, an t-eagras is mó a thacaíonn le forbairt na Gaeilge sa phobal, ag laghdú, bliain i ndiaidh bliana ar feadh deich mbliana nó mar sin. Cuid den chúis taobh thiar de seo ná go bhfuil an maoiniú roinnte idir an dá dhlínse ar an oileán. Nuair atá easpa airgid sa Phoblacht, cosúil le tráth an chúlaithe eacnamaíochta, tagann meath ar mhaoiniú an Fhorais. Nuair a tharlaíonn amhlaidh sa Tuaisceart tagann meath arís ar an maoiniú. In ainneoin go bhfuil an maoiniú tábhachtach do na healaíona ag dul i méid, rud atá muid buíoch de, tá an Ghaeilge ag fulaingt. Mar chuid de Bhliain na Gaeilge, mar chuid de lorg na bliana seo, an ngeallfadh an Tánaiste athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar mhúnla maoinithe Fhoras na Gaeilge? Ligfeadh é seo don Rialtas beart de réir a bhriathair a thaispeáint don teanga le maoiniú Fhoras na Gaeilge a ardú.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Nuair a deirtear "níl sí doiligh a iompar" - it is no load for me to carry her - is í teanga Ceilteach uasal na nGael atá i gceist leis an bhfocal "her" nó an focal "sí". Is teanga nuálaíoch Eorpach agus teanga náisiúnta na hÉireann í an Ghaeilge, teanga a bhí díbeartha ón seomra ranga ag Rialtas na Breataine roimh aimsir an Ghorta Mhóir. Tá an Ghaeilge fós beo beathach stuacach ceanndána, agus níl sé ar intinn aici bás a fháil inniu nó amárach. Is í an Ghaeilge an tríú teanga scríofa is sine san Eoraip tar éis an Ghréigis agus an Laidin. Téann sé siar i bhfad roimh aimsir na Normannach agus aimsir na Lochlannach go dtí laethanta órga an ré Cheiltigh. Le blianta beaga anuas, tá borradh le brath i bhforbairt na nGaelscoileanna ar fud an oileáin seo, ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Béal Feirste agus ó Dhún na nGall go dtí An Daingean. Tá cláracha den scoth á gcraoladh ar TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tá aitheantas ag an teanga i bParlaimint na hEorpa. Ní bréag a rá go bhfuil an tír seo mar eiseamláir go hidirnáisiúnta maidir lenár gcur chuige ó thaobh cosaint na teanga. Cé go bhfuil dea-thoil i leith na Gaeilge i measc an phobail i gcoitinne, ní mór dúinn a bheith airdeallach ar riachtanais mhuintir na Gaeltachta. D'fhoghlaim mé mo chuid Gaeilge ar scoil i gContae Mhuineacháin. Chaith mé bliain i gColáiste na Rinne i gContae Phort Láirge agus cúpla samhradh iontach i Ros Muc. Táim dílis do theanga ár sinsir agus bródúil as an tsaibhreas oidhreachta a bhaineann léi. Teastaíonn uaim an grá céanna a chothú i mo pháistí féin. Ní hionann mo thaithí leis an teanga agus taithí na máithreacha i gceantair Ghaeltachta atá ag snámh in aghaidh easa ag iarraidh seirbhísí tacaíochta a fháil trí Ghaeilge chun cabhrú leo a gclann a thógáil.Is éard atá i gceist agam ná go gcaithfimid dúshláin an teaghlaigh Gaeltachta a thuiscint. Más rud é go bhfuil m’iníon tinn agus go gcaithfidh mé í a thabhairt chuig an dochtúir tá rogha dochtúirí agam. Ach, má tá páiste Gaeltachta trí bliana d’aois nach bhfuil ag freastal ar an mbunscoil fós, agus Gaeilge ón gcliabhán aici, tinn i seomra dochtúra agus gan ach Béarla ag an dochtúir níl an tseirbhís seo sásúil. Muna féidir le príomhoide ar Inis Meáin nó Inis Mór siceolaí oideachais a fháil le Gaeilge chun cabhrú le meabhairshláinte déagóra níl sé seo sásúil. Ní liosta le háireamh é seo. Tá faillí á ndéanamh againn ar na daoine óga seo. Ní leor a rá go bhfuil, ar a laghad, siceolaí nó dochtúir le Béarla ar fáil. Is tír muid le dhá theanga ach is léir nach bhfuil cothromaíocht go fóill eatarthu. Mar a dúirt mé, d’fhoghlaim mé mo chuid Ghaeilge ar scoil ach más rud é gur tógadh le Gaeilge ón gcliabhán duine ba chóir go mbeadh an Stát ag freastal air nó uirthi mar is cuí, is é sin, ag cur seirbhísí ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Is é mo thuairim nach smaoiníonn muidne a tógadh le Béarla sa bhaile ar na deacrachtaí a bhíonn ag teaghlaigh Gaeltachta atá ag iarraidh a gcuid páistí a thógáil trí Ghaeilge. Is ábhar machnaimh dúinn uilig an méid sin atá ráite agam faoi chearta. Mar an gcéanna, tá géarghá le poist a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht, poist a bheidh in oiriúint do phobal na Gaeilge. Tá samhlaíocht maraon le hinfheistíocht ag teastáil chun é seo a chur i gcrích. Tuigim na fadhbanna a bhíonn ag an Rialtas ó am go chéile ó thaobh easpa airgid de. Ach, más fiú é, is féidir. Seachain an easpa físe. Ná tréig muintir na Gaeltachta. Agus Bliain na Gaeilge á chéiliúradh againn ná déanaimis dearmad gur lá na Gaeilge é chuile lá na seachtaine do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Ach ní bheidh todhchaí ann do pháistí Gaeltachta gan tacaíocht an Stáit. Ó thosaigh an Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív amach ar bhóthar an Achta teanga 15 bliana ó shin, is mór an dul chun cinn atá déanta i dtreo na Gaeilge a chosaint agus a chothú. Ach, ná ligimis ár maidí le sruth. Le hidéalachas tiocfaidh fís. Le fís tiocfaidh fuinneamh. Agus le fuinneamh tiocfaidh feabhas ar chúrsaí teanga. Is éard is teanga ann ná fuaim; fuaim anama. Ní aithníonn fuaim ársa an oileáin seo teorainn nó reiligiún. Ní dhéanann fuaim Cheilteach an oileáin seo idirdhealú idir an am atá caite, an tréimhse reatha ina mairimid agus an t-am atá le teacht. Bíodh Gaeilge nó Béarla againn ón gcliabhán, maireann fréamhacha na fuaime seo i smior na gcnámh, inár gcuislí agus inár gcroíthe laistigh i ngan fhios dúinn féin. Is léir don saol le fada go bhfuil Béarla na tíre seo múnlaithe ag taibhse na Gaeilge.  Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine. Ní chóir go bhfágfar muintir na Gaeltachta ar thaobh amháin den bhóthar agus muidne, muintir na galltachta agus Gaeilgeoirí inár measc, ar an taobh eile. Ní neart go cur le chéile. Baineann an fhuaim Cheilteach le gach duine idir óg agus aosta ar an oileán seo, ag tabhairt san áireamh gach treibh agus ionsaitheoir a tháinig trasna na dtonnta chugainn, Lochlannaigh, Francaigh agus Sasanaigh. Ní nach ionadh gur roghnaigh Banríon na Breataine Móire, Éilis II, labhairt as Gaeilge nuair a bheannaigh sí Uachtarán na hÉireann i gCaisleán Bhaile Átha Cliath in 2011. Agus an freagra, is dócha, a thabharfadh an Ghaeilge ar an mbanríon, ná "Mise Éire: Sine mé ná an Chailleach Bhéarra".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. The introduction of the Bill is important for our society and our country. It marks an opportunity for change. It presents an opportunity to repeal an uncompromising article of the Constitution which has caused untold and unnecessary suffering for thousands of women since its inception in 1983. Ultimately, the Legislature must bear responsibility for the ongoing endangerment of the health and safety of women. The courts have on a number of occasions reminded us it is our function to legislate and they have, quite correctly, signalled their unwillingness to fill the gap and do our job as the Legislature. The Green Party will support this Bill and will be campaigning for a "Yes" vote in the referendum that will follow. The eighth amendment has not worked. It has resulted in a system that has treated and continues to treat women appallingly. This referendum is an opportunity to make a change because change is needed. Not only have we abandoned women by forcing them to leave their own country to access a safe medical procedure, but also we have compounded it by threatening and sanctioning women and doctors with severe punishment and threatening them with jail sentences. The threat and stigma surrounding abortion puts women in a dangerous position and continues to tie the hands of doctors when it comes to emergency scenarios. When not responded to properly, as the country has learned to its eternal shame, it can result in the tragic and unavoidable death of mothers. Women should not have to steal away from their country to access a safe medical procedure and not one woman’s life should be put in unnecessary danger. It is time to trust women. We need to trust women. The Minister said in his opening speech that moving towards the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee would represent a quantum leap from our current position. I welcome that leap, as our country is now ready to take it. I also acknowledge the Minister has committed to the principle that abortion in this country should be safe, legal and rare. The Green Party supported the Citizens’ Assembly and as part of our support of that process we also support free, safe and legal access to treatments for pregnant people, up to and including legal terminations of pregnancy without restriction, up to 12 weeks’ gestation. The Green Party is in favour of deferring decisions on terminations after this point to such conditions and time limits as recommended by qualified medical practitioners who are subject to the Medical Council. As a country, we are an outlier. The implementation of the recommendations of the committee will bring us in line with Greece, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Finland and France, among others, in allowing access to abortion up to 12 weeks. One of the many lessons to be learned from 1983 is the need for the Legislature to be trusted as the Constitution is unsuitable for detailed provisions that tie the hands of future generations. It is time to move forward with compassion. I recognise the work of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment, particularly that of the Chairman, Senator Noone, for coming to a considered, shared and compassionate set of recommendations. I hope the upcoming referendum campaign will be a respectful one. I hope we can have a frank, positive and constructive discussion on the issue. I hope we become a country that provides full support for all women who decide to continue with their pregnancies as well as providing support to those who do not. I welcome the debate today because for too long the voices of our elected representatives were not sufficiently loud nor adequately effective, just, coherent or steadfast. That is why we are where we are today where some women’s lives continue to be endangered. Ireland can no longer pretend, indefinitely postpone or prevaricate, and that is why the Green Party will support this Bill and campaign for a "Yes" vote in the referendum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The programme for Government commits that significant Exchequer resources are invested in both current and capital spending in the higher education sector. As other Deputies have raised, in Trinity College, the Taoiseach's own alma mater, in recent weeks the burden of investment in education has fallen squarely on the shoulders of students with the introduction of a €450 flat fee for supplemental exams. The Minister has just said that the protests and the ongoing negotiations have nothing to do with the Government but at the heart of this issue is the Government's lack of investment in higher education which is leading to those stealth fees being imposed on students. The current situation in Trinity College is that the students are waiting for the ongoing negotiations with the university administration to conclude and the exams are only a month away, which is causing unnecessary stress for the students. What plans does the Taoiseach have to further invest in higher education to prevent universities from resorting to demanding those types of fees from vulnerable students in the future?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. Today, the people of Ireland do not have trust in the most essential and basic of State services, the health service. The stories we have heard in the past two weeks are beyond shocking. It is a harrowing and frightening fact that women have been treated in such a way. The heartbreaking stories of Vicky Phelan and of Emma Mhic Mhathúna have shaken the nation to its core and we are indebted to their courage and honesty in the face of unimaginably difficult circumstances. Stephen Teap learned last week that his late wife, Irene, was one of the women who received false negative test results in 2010 and 2013. She passed away last year without ever knowing. When Stephen was told of his wife's false negative tests, the news was followed only by a goodbye, with no meaningful support provided to him in his time of greatest need. Has nothing been learned? Where is the support and compassion? All of the women concerned and their families deserve full and transparent answers on everything that happened in respect of CervicalCheck. They need justice because Vicky and Emma and their families, all of whom have shown great courage and their honesty, deserve nothing less. It is now a matter for each and every Member of the House to ensure the health service is held accountable. To achieve trust, we need an absolute priority to be placed on creating better and prompt communication to women about what their results mean in all cases. The mistrust created by these events needs to be quickly counteracted in order that the damage caused by the CervicalCheck scandal does not dissuade women from coming forward for check-ups. To achieve real trust, the State must stop deciding what is best for women without consulting, asking or empowering them in any meaningful decision and policy-making process. The Government and State as a whole must guarantee that nothing like this ever happens again. The Government must also learn from this scandal. It cannot continue to stumble from crisis to crisis but must commit, as must all Deputies, to real and substantial patient-centred health service reform. We need reform of the current legal resolution process in medicine to move it away from an adversarial legal system that has the potential to cause further trauma for patients and their families. We need to reform the system to ensure it becomes patient-centred and is not dependent on legal recourse. The Green Party welcomes the motion and agrees that the Government must legislate for mandatory open disclosure of all information when errors occur that affect patient care. We need to place a statutory duty on all officials in the Department of Health and Health Service Executive to provide full information to a health care regulator, statutory agency and Minister in cases of systemic failure in health care. We also need to ensure a statutory duty is imposed on all officials in the Department and HSE, including the Minister for Health and director general of the HSE, to be truthful in any information given to the Health Information and Quality Authority or any relevant statutory agency. The Green Party agrees that these requirements are needed and we will support the motion.  We also need to ensure the goals of all audits conducted are fully realised. We need assurance that when problems and discrepancies are encountered, practices will be improved so as to tackle and resolve them. The State owes it to the women of Ireland never again to let this happen. In the midst of these heartbreaking cases, it is important to remember that the objective evidence is that the national cervical screening programme is reducing the incidence of cervical cancer and the best way to reduce the risk of cervical cancer is to stay within the national programme and vaccinate our daughters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister must restore confidence in the programme.It is critically important that confidence in such a vital service is restored as a matter of urgent priority.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is the future.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak again in this House on pay inequality in the public service. I appreciate that it is a complicated issue, rather than an easy one, but it is now 2018, seven years since the first new entrants to the public service were put on a different pay scale than that of their older counterparts. Some new entrants have been doing the same work for less pay than their counterparts for seven years and there is still no clear end in sight. Our young people have been devalued. They are receiving a loud and clear message that their work is not worth as much as that of their older colleagues despite the fact that they are doing the exact same job and have the exact same responsibilities. With regard to teachers, who make up a significant proportion of those affected by this inequality, a recent OECD report, Education at a Glance, found a direct correlation between teachers' pay the quality of education. The teaching profession has been devalued. This will have a detrimental impact on the future quality of education. There is a multi-tier system whereby newly qualified teachers earn more than 20% less than their colleagues. Younger teachers play a vital role in the future direction of education and they are highly skilled, specialist classroom practitioners entrusted daily with major and far-reaching responsibilities. By allowing a differential pay scale to continue, we are telling our teachers that they do not matter and that we do not care. That is simply not good enough. They, along with so many public servants who are suffering from similar inequalities, will continue to leave our shores if this continues. In recent weeks, the teachers' unions met at their annual conferences and backed calls for potential strike action if the Government does not properly address this issue once and for all. An unambiguous, direct and straightforward commitment that the Government will not allow unequal pay for equal work to continue is absolutely essential. For these teachers and so many in our public service, enough is enough. This is a very complicated issue but it is also a very simple one. It all comes down to the simple principle for which activists and societies have fought for centuries for women and minority groups, namely, the principle of equal pay for equal work. I look forward to the outcome of the talks between the Minister and the unions but I call on the Government to continue with the clear understanding that it is not sustainable in a fair, just and equitable society to pay anyone less than anyone else for the same work. That is non-negotiable.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome this report from the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. Many of the issues it covers and many of the actions it suggests were also included in a motion on building standards and homeowner protection tabled by the Green Party that was passed by the Dáil last June. I commend all the members of the committee on their work on this report, as well as all the expert witnesses who contributed to it. The issues this report outlines are damning. For those people who save up and take on a mortgage, a house and a home is the most expensive and important decision they and their families will ever make, yet control and regulation in this area is still woefully inadequate. We can see that we still have a culture of industry self-regulation. We still have massive under-resourcing and bad communication in and between the building control sections of local authorities. While the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 constituted a positive change to the regime that was in place before, it is still a system of self-certification. The lack of regulation and quality control on our homes is still hanging over us. Last week the independent inquiry into building standards that was ordered by the UK Government following the Grenfell tragedy was published. That report speaks of a race-to-the-bottom culture in the construction industry - doing things as cheaply as possible - where concerns by others involved in the building process, or residents of housing, are ignored. It also speaks of a lack of enforcement of the regulations, which are not seen as an effective deterrent. This certainly was the case in Ireland during the boom era and may still be true today. Residents are living in dangerous homes, afraid for their safety, with no help from Government to fix defects. Enforcement is under-resourced and practically non-existent. The recommendations the report before us outlines would go some way towards ensuring the safety of our homes. This report sets out four sets of recommendations. The first set calls for a new State regulator for building standards. Such a regulator would be along the lines of the Food Safety Authority and the environmental protections. It would be a strong, well-resourced independent building regulator, something which was also called for in the Green Party's motion last June. We desperately need such a regulator to oversee national building control and actively and robustly regulate those involved in construction. We cannot ensure there is appropriate building control compliance in this country without a fully resourced, new building regulator office with a real and effective enforcement agency. This ties into the second set of recommendations, which looks at making the building control regulations truly independent. The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 put in place a system of assigned certifiers but this is still effectively self-regulation by the construction industry. Orla Hegarty of UCD has said that a self-builder or developer is effectively appointing someone to police him or herself, while the appointed person does not have to be independent of the process and has no legal powers. Under the current system, there is absolutely no guarantee that the assigned certifier under the 2014 regulations must be independent of the developer. He or she can still be an employee of the developer and have other close links to the developer he or she is certifying. We do not accept self-regulation in the food industry or in regard to the protection of our environment. Why do we accept self-regulation in regard to the industry that builds one of the most important things in our lives, our homes? The third set of recommendations relates to the need for substantial law reform. Since Fine Gael took office in 2011 there has been no substantive legislative reform to create new remedies for anyone who finds he or she is living in a defective house.I have been working with construction law expert Deirdre Ní Fhloinn in drafting new primary legislation to include robust legal remedies for homeowners from builders and those involved in the building process, and I hope to introduce it to the House before the end of this term. The fourth and final set of recommendations relates to dealing with the legacy of defects in housing. In my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, there are developments where families are facing bills of up to €30,000 to rectify problems not of their making. These families are left with dangerously defective housing with no legal recourse to the corner-cutting cowboy builders who built shoddy homes in an unregulated environment and then sold them to unsuspecting homeowners. There is not even a phone number that they can ring to seek advice on the numerous frightening letters which they have received in recent weeks. They are terrified that boom era building defects will financially ruin them through no fault of their own. The Government has been inactive on this issue, relying on the homeowners' fear that if they go public the value of their properties will be destroyed, putting them in further financial peril. This is not right, fair or just. Every time I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach and members of the Government, it has been dismissed as being entirely a matter between private parties to a private contract. The Minister did so again tonight. This is a public health issue brought about by an ineffective building control regime exploited by cowboy builders through the boom under the State's watch. Will it take a tragedy to occur or lives to be lost before the Government takes action? Practical reliefs for people living in substandard and defective homes need to, and must, be considered in the upcoming budget. These can be simple and practical measures like property tax relief or expanding VAT relief on works, which will impose minimal cost on the Exchequer, particularly as the Government provides similar tax reliefs to developers. These people are not looking for a handout. They are asking for practical information and assistance. They are pleading that the Government not abandon them. The Green Party motion on building standards and homeowner protection passed by the Dáil last year and the "Safe as Houses?" report we are debating today outline the measures Government can take. Inaction is no longer an option. The conversation on relief for these homeowners must not end with this debate today. It cannot be wrapped up and filed away on a shelf in Government Buildings like so many other reports on which no action has been taken. These recommendations have the potential to improve things not just for the future but also for people dealing with defects in their homes right now. The Minister said that he believes that the building control reform agenda and other initiatives under way provide a full and comprehensive roadmap to embedding a culture of real compliance with the construction industry. This report contains the roadmap for improving the position and lives of these homeowners. It is the real roadmap that Government needs to follow. Will the Minister please give a commitment tonight that he will at the very least explore all options for giving assistance to the many homeowners who are pleading for his help?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What occurred this weekend was a truly remarkable seismic shift in our society and a historic maturing in our country. Tens of thousands of people around the country campaigned, canvassed, told their stories and had difficult conversations with loved ones and they delivered a "Yes" vote. The people of Ireland spoke with a clear voice that, no matter the difficulties or decisions facing our people, we will look after them in our own country. I congratulate the Together for Yes campaign and thank everyone who campaigned and canvassed in their droves throughout the length and breadth of the country. The dedication, energy and passion for change I saw in the members of the local Dublin-Rathdown Together for Yes group was inspiring. I hope that everyone who became engaged and active in seeking a change through the course of that campaign and every activist who knocked on doors, delivered leaflets, stood at stalls on a Saturday afternoon, continues to fight for change and remains active in politics, and helps us all to fully realise the power of a nation engaged in a true democratic process. Every Irish woman who in the past was shamed and forced to travel abroad will hopefully have felt a sense of joy, or at least relief, on Saturday knowing that her sister, daughter or friend will not have to face a similar journey. This campaign highlighted the need to put in place more supports for all women and mothers in Irish society. By addressing the challenges in Ireland's housing, social welfare, education and economic systems which disproportionately affect young women, we can move towards a really pro-choice society where every prospective mother has real freedom in what she decides to do. It is up to us in this House now to ensure that full effect is given to the will of the people as quickly and as clearly as possible and that we as a society take caring and compassionate responsibility for those women who for so long were left behind and driven away.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Minister will be aware, I put forward a series of amendments on Committee Stage to allow the National Council for Special Education to compel a school to open an ASD unit. This amendment is not as strong as what I proposed but I welcome the move in the right direction. I agree with other Deputies who have spoken that the mechanism the Minister is adopting is vague and convoluted. On the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, compiling a report if there is insufficient capacity in an area, will the Minister clarify what constitutes insufficient capacity? Is there a minimum number? Is it when one, two or three students present to the school? I would like to be clear on the number as I do not believe the child is at the heart of the Bill. I respectfully suggest another issue that needs to be addressed within the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills and which is not helping at all. In management, leadership and learning, MLL, evaluations in a DEIS school, I have heard that inspectors pose a question to the staff about whether the school has ever asked itself why it has so many students with special educational needs. In turn, the inspectors are asked if they pose this question to other schools but rephrased as, "Has your school ever asked itself why it does not have children with special educational needs?" I suggest that, for the purposes of equality and fairness, this question be added to the MLL evaluation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Green Party is happy to support the Bill before the House this evening. I commend Sinn Fein and Deputy Ó Broin on bringing it forward. This Bill seeks to expand the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to apply to students living in student accommodation. It is not a complicated issue and seeks to extend rights to students, which they should not have to demand, the basic rights of any tenant be included in rent pressure zones and have access to the Residential Tenancies Board. This legislation is sorely needed as in recent months we have seen several instances of enormous and frankly exploitative rent hikes in student accommodation. In DCU, students in Shanowen Square last March were faced with the announcement of a 27% increase in rent for the academic year 2018-19. Earlier this year students in Cúirt na Coiribe in National University Galway, NUIG, were faced with an increase of up to €1,000 for 2018-19. That hike came in the middle of examinations, leaving students with huge decisions to make in a very short space of time if they wanted to secure accommodation for next September. The level of stress and anxiety this caused for students in the middle of an examination period is entirely and absolutely unfair in dealing with any tenants. To put it simply, students are being exploited. We, and many other parties on the left, have sought greater security of tenure for tenants and for more stringent caps on rent. It is remarkable to think that none of these might be applicable to students without this much-needed legislation.  The lack of investment in student support has resulted in third level institutions pushing more and more of the burden onto students. We saw this in the Trinity College Dublin protests at supplemental examination fees. It is not right or fair and something needs to be done because students are feeling too great a burden through lack of investment and are being forced to carry the cost. I welcome this move to bring students further into the fight to ensure greater rights for tenants of all descriptions and I call on the Government to move quickly to support this Bill’s passage through the Oireachtas or, if there are definitional issues to be addressed, as the Minister of State has indicated, that it moves quickly to incorporate it into its own legislation to be enacted as soon as possible. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the Minister's amendments because they go some way towards addressing the baptism barrier. It is imperative, especially in the new Ireland in which we live, that we adopt a consistent and non-partisan policy response to this difficulty, which has gone on for too long. Like many other Deputies, I have repeatedly called for the inequality of the baptism barrier to be addressed. I have advocated for equality of educational access and opportunity to be secured for all our children. Now, in a changing landscape, is the time to get our policy in this area right so that we do not have to revisit it. I do not think we should single out any religion because this is about all religions. If other religions do not face enrolment challenges right now, well and good. We need to legislate in a dispassionate way that treats everyone - Catholics and those of other religions or none - the same. This legislation must be applicable to one and all with no exceptions. That is the best way to ensure our children's right to access education is at the heart of this legislation. We must acknowledge, embrace and cater for the changing society we live in by ensuring all children are treated equally when it comes to education. The solution to the current difficulty is very simple - the Minister needs to remove the baptism barrier from all schools that receive State funding. It is much simpler than the Minister seems to be making it, or wanting to make it. I disagree with his amendments in principle because ending discrimination based on one religion while continuing discrimination based on other religions is another form of inequality. The serious problem with how these amendments have been drafted is that they are creating an overly complicated, convoluted and complex system that seems to leave out secondary schools for some reason I cannot understand. I ask the Minister to consider the amendments I am proposing. Amendment No. 42 proposes to disapply section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 from the admissions statement of any school that receives public funds. Amendment No. 53 seeks to disapply section 7(3)(c) of the 2000 Act from the admissions policy of any school that receives public funds. Amendment No. 140 seeks to amend section 7(3)(c) to provide that this exemption from discrimination cannot be applied to any school in receipt of public funds from the Department. It is a simple as that. We need to legislate in a dispassionate way that treats everyone the same. I would like to ask the Minister about amendment No. 2. The Equal Status Act 2000 prohibits discrimination across society on nine grounds, including religion. However, religious-controlled schools were given a derogation to allow them to give priority to children of a certain faith. Does this derogation now apply to secondary schools only? I think there is a risk that the Minister's amendment No. 137, which is detailed and convoluted, will result in all sorts of unforeseen circumstances. It allows all schools other than Catholic primary schools to discriminate on the basis of religion. Therefore, this proposal discriminates against Catholic schools. Regardless of whether 90% or 10% of schools in this country are Catholic schools, it is still discrimination. It is bordering on sectarian. Secondary schools will still be allowed to discriminate on the basis of religion. This will be a major issue for the children living in the areas surrounding the 20% of secondary schools that are oversubscribed. It is proposed that primary schools of minority religions will be able to apply for recognition as recognised primary schools under section 10 of the Education Act 1998. Amendment No. 137 defines "minority religion" as:... a religion other than a religion whose membership comprises in excess of 10 per cent of the total population of the State based on the population as ascertained by the Central Statistics Office in the most recent census report published by that office setting out the final result of a census of population of the State (whether or not that is the most recent such census of population).When I looked at the most recent census, I learned that 9.6% of the population falls under the category of "no religion". Will "no religion" be considered to be a minority faith? The lengthy, confusing and convoluted definition of "minority faith" that is being proposed in amendment No. 137 suggests that the minority religion of the moment could change with each census. I think it would be more logical and simpler to accept amendments Nos. 53 and 140 as a means of ensuring children have equal access to all schools regardless of religious belief.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have tabled amendments Nos. 89 and 104 in this group. Amendment No. 89 would require the Minister to provide guidelines for schools on how they should put in place age-appropriate alternatives for children who do not wish to attend classes in religious instruction, The Minister must set minimum standards for the nature of exemptions for students who do not want to attend classes in religious instruction. This would ensure freedom from discrimination and protection of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in schools. The Bill, in section 62(7)(n), already provides that a school should provide details of its policy on arrangements to meet parents' wishes or those of any student over 18 years who does not wish to attend classes in religious instruction. Government amendment No. 69 also ensures a student cannot miss a day of school if he or she does not attend classes in religious instruction. The next logical step is to ensure the Minister will set guidelines to ensure all students will be treated equally across schools when they opt out of classes in religious instruction. In February the Minister issued a circular to all ETB schools requiring them to provide alternative subject choices for students who wished to opt out of classes in religious instruction, but it only applies to ETB schools, the logic being they are multi-denominational. The amendment would compel the Minister to issue guidelines to all schools.  Amendment No. 104 would require the Minister in his regulations to set age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, for students who did not wish to attend classes in religious instruction in publicly funded schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On my amendment, if the Minister insists on religious instruction taking place during the school day, he will definitely need to set guidelines. I have worked in schools. I do not know how many the Minister has been in while religious instruction is happening. It happens on an ad hoc basis and is simply not good enough. It is not fair on students, teachers or parents. It is a timetable hazard and a nightmare for a principal. There are many scenarios. There are children who are not participating in religious instruction sitting at the back of the classroom. There are disciplinary nightmares for the teacher and children are listening to religious instruction as they try to study. There are schools which decide pupils can go to the library while religious instruction is taking place. Who supervises them? Sometimes they are not supervised. Who is the teacher who draws the short straw and has to do that duty instead of teaching his or her own subject? There is the situation where students study other subjects. This happens too in the case of Irish. Sometimes, in some schools, there are more students who are not taking Irish and there are no guidelines whatsoever for the schools on how to deal with the issue. It becomes a study class, which is completely unfair. Schools need guidelines. The Minister is leaving it up to schools, with some doing it right and some doing it wrong. If he insists on religious instruction taking place during the school day, guidelines are needed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would like to ask the Minister about amendment No. 49, which seeks to provide that a school will have to admit a student seeking admission to the school "including, where appropriate" a student seeking admission to a special class in the school. I wonder how that will work in practical terms. Will this provision not leave the door open to some discrimination? I ask the Minister to explain how this will work in practice to protect the child.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	How do we define what is "appropriate" in the context of admission to a special class?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 15, line 21, after “school”, to insert “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 45:In page 15, line 29, to delete "school." and substitute the following:"school, and(c) a school which teaches through the medium of Irish, and which gives priority in its admission policy to students who speak Irish as a home language, the admission statement of the school shall include a statement that the school does not discriminate in relation to the admission of students where it admits a student who speaks Irish as a home language in preference to others whose home language is not Irish.".I and colleagues here, Deputies Funchion and Thomas Byrne, have been discussing amendment No. 75 with which, as the Minister will be aware, we have problems because we do not believe the Minister's amendment protects the child who is fluent and where Irish is the home language. We are willing, if the Minister would withdraw his amendment No. 75, to withdraw our amendments that deal with this until we have an opportunity to come together on a cross-party basis with relevant stakeholders and maybe Department officials.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for agreeing to do so.
Táim ag súil le bheith ag obair le chéile chun Gaeilge líofa a chothú agus a chaomhnú.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As my colleagues have said, we are certainly not seeking that discrimination of any sort would creep into the school system. We want to protect the rights of those who have a reasonable level of fluency at home, but we also want to make sure we protect the educational rights of those who speak Irish as a home language, especially children with special educational needs who have Irish as a home language. I thank the Minister for agreeing to withdraw his amendment No. 75 for the moment. The opportunity to work together seems quite complicated but maybe we can get there and strike a happy balance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 53:In page 17, line 1, after “school” to insert “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 89:In page 22, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(3) (a) In particular, the Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, make regulations governing the age-appropriate arrangements to be made for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.(b) Such regulations shall have regard to the rights of students under the Constitution to attend a school in receipt of public funds without attending religious instruction or classes at that school.".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 104:In page 24, line 11, to delete "concerned." and substitute the following:"concerned;(e) age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in relation to students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 105:In page 24, line 12, to delete "(4) In this section" and substitute "(5) In this section".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 110:In page 25, line 35, after "to" where it firstly occurs to insert "make all reasonable efforts to".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Another week in the Dáil and there is another plea from the Opposition for the Government to tackle the worsening housing and homelessness crisis. There is little I can say today that I have not said before. The Government's housing strategy is simply not working. By any metric, it is failing badly. House prices are skyrocketing, rents are still rising unsustainably and every month new records for homelessness and child homelessness are being set. The ideas outlined in the motion are not new. Many Opposition Deputies have been calling for them for years. We are calling for them again because the Government has not listened. In June 2016, the Committee on Housing and Homelessness issued its final report. It recommended that the State increase its social housing stock by an average of 10,000 units per year. It identified the core root of the crisis as being the lack of building by local authorities and the Government's over-reliance on the private sector. The Government still has not changed its approach. It is still convinced the private sector will solve the housing crisis. In June last year, the Dáil passed a Green Party motion calling for an independent and well-resourced building regulator to protect homeowners. The Government has instead continued with its self-certification regime. In November, the Dáil passed a Sinn Féin motion calling for greater protection and security for tenants. The Government has not made any move to provide greater support for renters. In March, the Dáil passed another Green Party motion calling for the implementation of a cost-rental model of affordable public housing. There is no sign of the Government embracing cost-rental housing on the scale needed to tackle this crisis. The Government has not changed its course. We have heard constant talk of new politics since the beginning of this Dáil. We have seen it in action. We have seen cross-party support for a change of approach when it comes to housing. We, as the Opposition, have provided the ideas. We have called on the Government to take action. Is that not how a parliament is supposed to work? Obviously not on the watch of this Minister of State when it comes to tackling this unprecedented crisis in housing and homelessness. If a change is not made, we will continue to be in a housing crisis for as long as this Government lasts. It is a symptom of incredible short-sightedness to think that the road this Government has been going down on housing can work. The Government has tried its way for too long and it is not working. It is never too late to listen. Start today and commit to taking on board the ideas the Opposition puts forward. Let us commit to working together. This is not a laughing matter. We are talking about an unprecedented crisis in homelessness and housing. We ask him to take on reasonable practical solutions presented by the Opposition.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I saw the Minister of State laugh.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Nobody wants to see this housing crisis continue but it is only by listening to and acting on other ideas that we can provide housing to so many who are so much in need.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Due to President Donald Trump’s Administration’s zero tolerance border policy, all people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally, even those seeking asylum, face criminal prosecution. The US Department of Homeland Security claims that between mid-April and May of this year it has separated nearly 2,000 children from their parents after they crossed the Mexico border into the US. That equates to 65 children being split from their parents each day for the past six weeks. More than 100 of these children were under the age of four. Parents were told that their children were being taken for a bath or being taken away briefly for questioning. It took hours for parents to realise their children had been taken away indefinitely. One father died by suicide in a detention cell the night after his three year old child was physically ripped out of his arms. One mother had her child taken from her while she was nursing and she was placed in handcuffs when she tried to protest. Children are being held for weeks and months in cages and there are reports that parents who choose to return across the border cannot find their children. None of these children in Trump’s America will have a parent with them to protect them from the sickening reality of being caged en masse, alone and terrified, sleeping under foil blankets in a foreign land for months, if not years, on end. The only crime their parents committed was to try to escape from persecution and poverty and make a better life for their children. We have all heard the audio clip of children in a US Customs and Border Protection facility obtained by ProPublica. We have heard the children crying, in terrible distress, calling out for their parents and we have heard border patrol agents joking and laughing at them. The cries I heard on that clip, the young cries of "Mama" and "Papa", will haunt me as they will haunt us all. As a mother, it is haunting and truly frightening to hear these cries, the cries of frightened children, some no more than four years old, calling for their parents, aunts or relatives, alone, abandoned, surrounded by unfriendly faces in an unfriendly country and treated without dignity, respect, compassion or the most basic forms of human decency. There are no words strong enough to condemn the despicable actions of an Administration that would be willing to do this. This is coming from an Administration whose defence of these actions has been one of wild and fanciful evasion. President Trump has declared that the US is withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council, calling it a “hypocritical and self-serving” body that “makes a mockery of human rights”and “a cesspool of political bias”. There is absolutely no remorse from this President and no regret for the pain inflicted. The most basic and fundamental aspects of what we term human rights are being eroded in word and deed by an Administration full of hate, bile and vicious anger towards the most vulnerable of human beings. The EU is not blameless or innocent either. We cannot pretend that the EU does not have its own deterrence policies. The EU, including Ireland, is spending €180 million in Libya to deter migrants from making a journey that has drowned thousands in the Mediterranean Sea, including 784 people so far this year alone. The US treats people like cattle, while we in Europe treat them like cargo. Let the US be a warning to us. Let us end direct provision and use our influence here in Ireland to prevent the EU from following further the same poisonous route which comes only to one known end - children in cages and sinking boats labelled as “infestation” by demagogues like Trump.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I watched the summer economic statement of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, with interest yesterday and the soundbites were "prudence" and "realism". We agree that the budgetary process should be both prudent and realistic but when I contrast the priorities outlined in his statement with the Government's approach to a number of pressing issues facing Ireland, talk of prudence rings slightly hollow. The priority for this budget must be to address the crisis in housing, in the rental sector, homelessness, in mental health services, the waiting lists, people on trolleys and the Government's abysmal performance on climate change. If we are to tackle these issues in a prudent manner, the Government needs to accept reality and change course. In housing, how prudent is it to continue to outsource social housing to private landlords instead of implementing a significant public housing programme? It will be €23.8 million more expensive than building houses over 30 years, according to research by Maynooth university released last year. Cost-rental housing would be more affordable for our citizens and could be funded off-balance sheet but the Government continues with an expensive, wasteful, ineffective developer-led housing model and that is not prudent. On the health service or education, how prudent is it to pay for our young people to be trained as nurses, doctors or teachers only for them to emigrate in search of better terms and conditions of work, or for a better quality of life? We then have to spend huge money trying to fill staff positions in the health and education sectors from abroad. That is not prudent. Measures that appear to Government to be prudent in the short term might not be prudent in the long term. On the question of the long term, there is just one mention of climate change in the summer economic statement document. The Government is looking for plaudits for putting €500 million away for a rainy day when our abysmal performance on emissions reductions and climate change means we will be paying that exact same amount in fines for missing our climate change targets, according to a report from Climate Action Network, released earlier this week. That is not prudent. The Government has given up on our 2020 targets but there has been no acceptance of, or planning for, the fact that we are facing enormous fines for non-compliance. Facing up to this fact is a very necessary part of any economic realism and is the prudent thing to do. The Minister needs to provide a comprehensive plan as to how he will account for the money for the significant fines we will face for not meeting these targets. In the report from Climate Action Network, Ireland was ranked second worst in Europe at tackling climate change, ahead only of Poland. Everyone is aware that we are failing in climate change and failing terribly so why will the Government not face up to that reality? We are facing annual non-compliance fines of €500 million if we do not change course. What could we do with that €500 million? We could cut all public transport fares in half for all services on Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann. The money could build one new Luas line every year and we could have a Luas in Galway, Cork and Limerick with three years' worth of climate fines. Some 20,000 homes could be retrofitted every year with €500 million, the western rail corridor could be reopened, or 125,000 hectares of our degraded bogs could be restored or rewetted. Those projects are huge but they illustrate the scale of the fines we face unless the Government changes tack on climate. I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to prudence and realistic budgeting but perhaps his Government colleagues have not got the message yet. There is an enormous contrast between his statement yesterday and the actions of the Government. If he is preaching prudence, the Government needs to change tack in a range of areas. I hope to see that change of approach as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 is about to come before the select committee for detailed scrutiny. I seek clarity on the Government's position on ending oil and gas exploration. Last Friday, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment tweeted the following: "The number and capability of exploration companies involved is a welcome development and hopefully we will see an increase in drilling and the realisation of our oil and gas potential in the coming years." It is hard to believe but that tweet came directly from the Department with responsibility for climate action. It was deleted on Saturday. Will the Tánaiste indicate whether it was deleted because it is no longer the Government's policy to increase fossil fuel exploration or because the Department was embarrassed that it made clear, in black and white and for all to see, not only that this Government is not taking climate action seriously, but also, at a time when we all know we need to keep 80% of known fossil fuels in the ground, it seems to be hoping, wishing and dreaming of a deadly fossil fuel future?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is the relevant Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is my privilege to represent the constituency of Dublin Rathdown but I was brought up in nature. I was brought up in rural Ireland, though stony grey soil it may have been. This is exactly why I share the grave concerns of wildlife and heritage organisations such as BirdWatch Ireland, the Hedge Laying Association of Ireland, the Irish Wildlife Trust, An Taisce and the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations. I believe that sections 7 and 8 of the Bill are anti-heritage and should be consigned to the scrap heap. The Minister is aware that in our own constituency of Dublin Rathdown, wildfires have raged in Ticknock and on the Blackglen Road. Residents have been advised that the area is unsafe and to stay indoors. This gives us a sneak preview of what it could be like if we extend the burning period. Last year from 24 March to 22 May, the Irish Wildlife Trust recorded 97 illegal wildfires in rural areas. Some 39 of these were in special conservation areas that are protected by EU habitats legislation. Sadly, the current law and the penalties or sanctions imposed on persons who are convicted of such destructive vandalism fail abysmally to protect Ireland’s heritage. Instead of putting in place real disincentives, however, and carrying out a real investigation into what happened and providing appropriate supports to those affected by the forest infernos, the Government’s sole response appears to be a determination - which seems to be growing by the day - to pass this anti-heritage slash and burn legislation. As other Members have outlined, burning outside of the current season jeopardises a vast array of wildlife. For many birds, such as the endangered curlew whose population is in decline, March is a month of nesting. This is the time when they establish their territories, create their nests and prepare for laying their eggs. Curlews are facing global extinction. There are only 125 breeding pairs of curlews left in Ireland. There is a real risk that the Government's proposed change would be the last straw for the curlew. We need courageous leadership to face down the vested interests to protect our heritage. Amendment No. 16 put forward by the Green Party seeks to delete section 7(1) in its entirety. We believe the burning period should not be extended to March, full stop. We seek that subsection to be deleted entirely. On the other amendments in this group, amendments Nos. 15 to 23, inclusive, I ask the Acting Chairman's guidance. Does he want me to speak to them now or will I wait until amendments Nos. 15 and 16 have been voted on?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The other amendments are the physical alternatives. If the deletion of the entire subsection does not pass, this amendment would restrict the application of section 7(1) to only the part of section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976 that applies to the destruction of vegetation on uncultivated land. Otherwise, this section could be used to apply to land which is covered under the part of section 40 that applies to hedges. Similarly, amendment No. 21 seeks to restrict the application of section 7(2), which expands the Minister’s power to make regulations in respect of hedge cutting to just section 40(1)(b) in order that it does not open up all land covered under section 40, but just the land appropriate to hedge cutting regulation. Amendment No. 18 removes the power of the Minister to make regulations for the expansion of hedge cutting into August and replaces it with a power for the Minister to make regulations for derogations to section 40 of the Wildlife Act for the purpose of ensuring public health and safety under the Roads Acts, and outlining the parameters of any such regulations. The Minister has said that section 7(2) will help to ensure that issues such as overgrown hedges can be tackled in August. If this is truly the Minister’s intention, the phrasing of this amendment, which seeks to provide the Minister with the powers for purpose of ensuring health and safety, makes much more sense. I have already addressed amendment No. 21. Amendment No. 22 alters section 7(2) so that it applies specifically to the purpose of ensuring the safe use of public roads during August. Again, if road safety is really the Government's intention with this section, as is so often maintained, then this amendment makes more sense. Amendment No. 23 puts in place a further provision to section 7 allowing for the Minister to make regulations for further restrictions on hedge cutting into September, to protect the yellowhammer that nests into September. The yellowhammer is on the red list in Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To reply to some of the comments the Minister made, I appreciate that prosecutions have been taken under section 40 of the Wildlife Act which relate to the cutting of hedges during the closed periods. Not very many were taken but they happen. However, it is section 22 of the Wildlife Act which protects birds, their nests and eggs from mutilation and injury. That is the section the Minister reminded Deputies of on Committee Stage in terms of its importance for the protection of our birds. Since 2015, however, there have been zero prosecutions carried out. The protection and the resources do not exist to protect our birds. I know the Minister has a hectic schedule so I was very interested to hear that she had time to meet a turf cutting delegation courtesy of Deputy Michael Healy-Rae because it is my understanding that BirdWatch Ireland requested a meeting with the Minister to discuss the impact of this devastating Bill and no such meeting was facilitated. That is highly regrettable. Since she had time to meet the turf cutters, did she have time to meet the members of the Environmental Pillar and the Irish Wildlife Trust? I know that BirdWatch Ireland definitely asked her for a meeting and no such meeting was facilitated. That is a shameful lack of consultation with a stakeholder such as that. On previous Stages of the Bill, the Minister justified this legislation's expansion of burning into March and Northern Ireland's burning period, which extends to 14 April. However, what she did not mention is that this situation is currently an unmitigated disaster in Northern Ireland. In 2017, there were 2,231 wildfires throughout Northern Ireland that the Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service had to attend, and 511 of those occurred after 1 May. The Minister kept making that comparison and said that this will be good and that it will stop things happening but despite having that longer burning season, out of control fires have continued to wreak havoc in Northern Ireland. Changing the dates for burning will not stop out of control fires as controlled burning, as a management tool, is virtually non-existent in Ireland. This Bill as currently drafted will be disastrous for our wildlife and our natural heritage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 12, to delete lines 8 to 13 and substitute the following:"(2) Notwithstanding section 40 of the Act of 1976, the Minister may make regulations to provide for derogations from the restrictions of section 40(1) of the Act of 1976 in order to permit the management of vegetation growing in any hedge or ditch for the purpose of ensuring public health and safety pursuant to section 70 of the Roads Act 1993.(3) Regulations made under subsection 2 shall specify—(a) the species of wild flora which are not subject to the derogations,(b) the circumstances of risk and the circumstances of time and place under which such derogations may be granted,(c) the authority empowered to declare that the required circumstances obtain and which can impose conditions on the management of vegetation under the derogation, and(d) the controls which will be put in place to ensure compliance with the conditions.".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In this section, the Government is determined to attack our hedgerows and the wealth of wildlife to which they are home. Our hedgerows act as linear forestry. They provide feeding for birds, insects and mammals. They are integral to biodiversity, pollination, nesting and future breeding. Bumblebees and wild honey bees will also suffer by extending the permitted times to slash and cut down vegetation and flowering wild plants. Bees are clinging on but they face a barrage of man-made hazards, including the pesticides that the Minister referred to last night. Pesticides are the biggest perpetrators but that does not mean we should ignore the effects that hedge-cutting has on bees. It is predicted that one third of all bee species in Ireland will be extinct by 2030 and extending the hedge-cutting dates will amount to death by 1,000 cuts. Amendment No. 26 proposes to delete section 8 in its entirety, removing the exemption from section 40 of the Wildlife Act for work carried out under section 70 of the Roads Act. This is a point which several Deputies have raised but the Minister has not properly acknowledged. This section does not fall under the same trial period restrictions as section 7(2) but provides a permanent, complete and unregulated exception. The unregulated nature of this exception is very worrying.The Minister made the point that in the context of hedge cutting under section 7(1), as a result of any ministerial regulations put forward, there would only be the cutting of a single year's growth and that flails would be prohibited but there are no such regulations under section 8. The Minister cannot hide behind the regulations she claims she will make because this is a complete and unregulated exemption entered into primary legislation. Under section 8, anything goes. More than one season's growth goes. Flails are fair game. Amendment No. 27 restricts the disapplication of section 40 of the Wildlife Act and section 8 solely to work carried out by a local authority or pursuant to a notice from a local authority. This amendment would stop section 8 from opening this exemption up to work carried out under any subsection of section 70 of the Roads Act, but would allow people to engage with local authorities to either have obstructions or hazardous material removed or to remove it themselves on foot of notice from a local authority. Does the Minister intend to introduce a ban on the use of the flail during the nesting season where cutting for road safety is necessary? Its basic design is such that it fires hedge debris back into the heart of the hedge at high speed. Anything in the hedge that could not fly away would not stand a chance. The dangers of this type of machinery are writ large in operators' safety manuals. It is incredible to think that it can be operated on a public road by operators who have not had to pass a competency test in its safe operation. There have been fatalities with this type of machinery. A reciprocating, finger-bar type cutter would be less disruptive but such cutters are not as widespread or readily available as flail machines in many parts of the country. When a local authority cuts hedges for safety purposes during the nesting season, there is invariably a flag man or two operating to ensure traffic safety while the work is under way. Does the Minister intend to create an equivalent obligation on landowners for hedge cutting to be carried out by individuals? That would make it costly for landowners and no doubt there would be those who would seek to cut corners. Will we be increasing the risk of accidents by permitting landowners to carry out unsupervised hedge cutting on the roads during the busiest month of the year? Has that been considered? I also wish to clarify statements made by the Minister yesterday. She referred to the work of Birdwatch Ireland, in the context of sections 7 and 8, as being both a flagrant distortion of the facts and unscientific. She repeatedly said yesterday that Birdwatch Ireland had said the decline in numbers of the curlew was due to burnings. Birdwatch Ireland never claimed that. It agreed with the Minister's experts that habitat loss and degradation are the primary reasons that there are only 120 breeding pairs of curlews left in the country. However, Birdwatch Ireland has advised that a relaxation of burning regulations could put the curlew over the edge as a result of habitat loss and degradation. The curlew is not necessarily in the position it is in because of the burning and Birdwatch Ireland never made that claim. However, the Minister's new regulations will sound its death knell. It is important that the Minister understands that she is misinformed and is misattributing to Birdwatch Ireland statements that it simply has not made. With respect, when one is making accusations of misinformation, it is important that one is properly informed. The changes in this section and the previous one are the most significant roll back of the legal protections for wildlife in the history of the State. Now is the time when we should be increasing our protection for vulnerable wildlife rather than reducing it. There are no positive changes for wildlife as a result of the Bill. Tá an Comhaontas Glas go mór i gcoinne an Bhille seo mar is léir don dall go mbeidh tubaistí gan aon mhaith ag eiceolaíocht na hÉireann agus cothóidh an Bille seo slad mór millteanach ar oidhreacht nádúrtha na tíre.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I just happened to mention it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	So the Minister should not accuse it of something.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister likes to talk about facts but BirdWatch Ireland is just one of the science-based conservation organisations which she has refused to meet or to consult on this Heritage Bill. The facts are, regrettably, that last night in this Chamber, when members of that organisation were not here to defend themselves, the Minister accused their work of being a flagrant distortion of the facts and unscientific. She accused them of saying the decline in the number of curlew was due to burning but they never said that. Several Ministers and Deputies have said in the course of this debate that the burning season in Northern Ireland extends into April but that has done nothing to stop illegal and uncontrolled burning. The same Deputies have not made the point that the hedgecutting dates in Northern Ireland are in line with those in the Republic. The dates in the North, which exclude August, are the way they are because of a review which held that the dates were valid to provide protection to birds during the breeding season. The Members involved have been quite selective in their comparisons. Cutting a hedge in the period between March and August impinges negatively on the overall wildlife of the hedgerow and any suggestion that a hedge can be cut without impacting on the wildlife in the hedge is simply not credible. The question is to what degree there is an impact. For Deputies to ask us to depend on the birds to be wise enough not to nest in roadside hedges is beyond ludicrous. Other Deputies talked about protection of the human species and road safety, having done nothing but delay the passage of new road safety legislation through the Dáil with no thought for those whose loved ones have been lost on the roads. That is very hard to take. I will finish with another fact. All the organisations up and down this country which preserve our environment and wildlife have said that sections 7 and 8, as they stand, are a disaster for Irish wildlife and our natural heritage. Nach bhfuil sé oiriúnach go bhfágfaidh an tAire Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta scrios ar chomhshaol agus ar oidhreacht nádúrtha na tíre?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 26:In page 12, to delete lines 23 to 29.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Green Party is broadly in favour of BusConnects. However, while I do not agree with the motion to throw the baby out with the bath water, I have a few specific observations from my constituency of Dublin Rathdown. Churchtown, Nutgrove and Ballinteer have been massively underserved by public transport services in recent years. With the elimination of the 48A, 14A and 16A bus routes, the 14 bus route is the only one which serves Churchtown, Nutgrove and the north end of Ballinteer in the direction of town, with the 17 and 75 bus routes running east-west. There is a presumption that everyone in this area can use the Luas, but that is not the case, given the distances involved, in particular for the elderly and those with impaired mobility. With the revised BusConnect routes, the area will still only be served by the east-west S6-S7 route and a new 14 bus route which cuts out Churchtown and Ballinteer south of the Barton Road East roundabout at Nutgrove, as far as the roundabout at the junction of Broadford Road and Stone Masons Way. The residents of Hillview, Llewellyn, Marley Court, Meadow Mount, Meadowbrook, Beaumont Avenue, Holylands, Landscape, Whitehall and Whitebarn have again been forgotten. At the very least, services on the 14 bus route must be more frequent and alternative options should be considered, in particular between the roundabout at Broadford Road and the roundabout at Barton Road East. Residents in Sandyford village have concerns about the proposed new routes, as does the community in Kilternan which is currently served by the 44 bus route which allows access to town through Dundrum. The 44 bus service will be replaced by the 213 bus service from Kilternan to UCD. Given the importance of Dundrum as a hub for people throughout the area, it is surely the case that the people of Kilternan should continue to have a service to Dundrum. To that end, I recommend extending the 12 bus route all the way to Kilternan. It makes no sense for the proposed A3 route to extend to Balally Luas stop and then turn down Dundrum main street. No one lives along this stretch and the buses will further clog up the narrow street. Retaining the old 14 bus route from Wyckham roundabout along the Ballinteer Road would continue an important service for the people of Lynwood, Ludford, Ailesbury Lawn, Wyckham Park Road and the areas around the Willows. The last issue I raise is a vital one for many in the area. There is still no direct service for people living in any residential part of Dublin Rathdown to St. Vincent's University Hospital. I suggest rerouting the S6-S7 service from Tallaght to Blackrock to St. Vincent's University Hospital instead.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have asked the Government numerous times in recent years to take action on practical actions for homeowners affected by latent defects in their homes. I met the Minister of State, Deputy English, to discuss the strain that homeowners in my constituency of Dublin-Rathdown are under. He indicated that he would meet them but regrettably he subsequently changed his mind and no such meeting will now take place. As the Taoiseach knows, the Green Party has, on many occasions, called on the Government to investigate practical measures to help these homeowners. Nearly two years ago, the Dáil supported a Green Party motion calling on the Government to set up a scheme to remediate legacy defects. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government made a similar call earlier this year. Does the Government intend to investigate this issue at national level? Will it take steps in budget 2019 to mitigate the pain and distress these people are burdened with, or will they remain abandoned?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am sharing my time with Deputies Shortall and Healy. When people are being made homeless faster than the Government can get them out of homelessness, something is not working. When more than 50 households enter into rental distress every day and need to avail of the housing assistant payment, HAP, something is not working. When Fine Gael has been in government for more than seven years and the housing crisis has only grown worse and worse, something is not working. The Government's solutions to the crisis are not working. That is why many political parties, as well as trade unions, students, community activists and housing and homelessness organisations, were united at the Raise the Roof demonstration outside Leinster House today to demand the real action that is needed on housing and the homeless crisis. In July of this year, there were 9,891 people who were homeless and in emergency accommodation, almost 4,000 of whom were children. The number of homeless families has increased by 18% since the summer of 2017. Rent in Dublin is at an all-time high and many renters are living in insecure tenancies. House prices are entirely unaffordable for most people. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown the median house price is more than €500,000. This is unaffordable for young and older people in my constituency. Frankly, it is unaffordable for most people in my constituency, full stop. Why does the Government continue to accuse all Members of the Opposition of not putting forward solutions when clearly we all have done so? The Green Party in the Dáil and Seanad has put forward proposals for measures to invest in large-scale cost-rental public housing; create an independent building regulator; increase and strengthen the vacant and derelict sites levy; and to expand the security of tenure for renters. Sinn Féin has put forward solutions, as has Solidarity-People Before Profit. The Labour Party, the Social Democrats, Fianna Fáil, Independents 4 Change and many other Independents have come forward with solutions but the Government does not listen. The Government needs to make a truly substantial investment in cost-rental public housing, as proposed and supported by all parties that have tabled this motion. Let us build public housing to scale, open to people of all incomes and social backgrounds, creating sustainable, diverse communities, as in Vienna and many other European cities. In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown there are several sites that would be perfect locations for the cost-rental model.I and community organisations such as Dundrum Housing Action have called on the Government to ensure that State lands are used for public housing, including all of the Central Mental Hospital land in Dundrum, the sites between the Central Bank buildings in Sandyford, the NAMA site in Sandyford industrial estate and the site beside Leopardstown racecourse, to create a diverse community of people of all incomes in affordable State rental homes. Dundrum, Dublin and Ireland need this model. I plead with the Minister to listen to the experts, those who work every day on housing and homelessness and the people of Ireland who gathered outside Leinster House today. The Government must build public housing on public land and build stronger and more secure communities.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is lá cinniúnach é seo do mhná na hÉireann, dóibh siúd atá torrach nó a bheidh amach anseo, agus do na daoine agus na grúpaí ó cheann ceann na tíre a bhain éacht amach i mí na Bealtaine seo caite. Today is an historic day. Today, for the first time since 1983, we commence the process to legislate without constitutional constraint to bring compassionate healthcare to pregnant people in Ireland. We owe this day to the people who campaigned tirelessly over the past 35 years and to all those who shared their very personal and traumatic experiences. As we have much work yet to do on this proposed legislation, I will be brief in outlining some concerns the Green Party has about it. First, I am concerned about the language used in the section concerning offences and, as other Deputies have mentioned, the location of this section within the Bill, but I will bring those concerns to Committee Stage.The Bill also outlines that three days must elapse from the certification of the person seeking termination by a medical doctor before a termination is carried out. The Minister has pledged that people from Northern Ireland will have access to abortion services here. I and my Green Party colleague and Member of the Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland, Clare Bailey, have brought our concerns about this specific issue to the Minister's attention. How would that access to abortion services be feasible if two appointments with a doctor may be required? For some travelling across the Border this would mean a three-hour round trip. That is just to get across the Border. It could be longer depending on where the nearest medical practitioner who will assist them is located. That is two three-hour round trips and two days off within a week. This does not represent a feasible option for many given the time required and the expense of travel. How is this compatible with the pledge made to those in Northern Ireland? There are also concerns for people in rural Ireland who may have to travel significant distances to find a medical practitioner who is willing to help. It is also a concern for people who lack the financial resources or ability to travel or to take time off work. We must put ourselves in the shoes of those who find it difficult to take the time to visit a doctor and we must ensure the legislation does not put more barriers in front of them. There have been suggestions of changing this provision to allow the three-day waiting period to commence from the time of booking the appointment. We must again tease out how this would work in practice. How would we ensure the confidentiality of the patient? To ask for an appointment three days out may allow the person taking the call to infer the purpose of the visit. How is a doctor to know when the appointment was made without first asking those at the front desk? I ask the Minister to provide clarification on these concerns and to ensure that, if a three-day waiting period is included, it supports decision-making without creating arbitrary barriers. The Bill constantly refers to the “pregnant woman”. I have spoken to the Minister on this matter before and he has been receptive to changing the phrase to “pregnant person” to be inclusive of trans and non-binary people. While I appreciate that legalistically speaking the phrase “pregnant woman” can be interpreted to mean someone of another gender and does not represent a barrier to accessing services, a simple change of language is symbolically important. It would be an important gesture of recognition and inclusivity. There is much work to be done on this legislation over the next few months but I remain hopeful that we in this House can approach that work in a considered and thorough manner.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ar dtús báire, I extend my sympathies to the family and friends of the remarkably courageous Emma Mhic Mhathúna. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam dílis. Here we are again with the third budget of Fine Gael, the Independent Alliance and Independents. What does the Government have to show for it? All it has to show for it is an ongoing housing and homelessness crisis with 10,000 people homeless, 100,000 people on the social housing list and unaffordable rental and purchase prices in our cities and a higher education sector that is struggling after years of underinvestment. The cost of living is going up in every way for families, older people and students in areas like healthcare, schools and child care, not to mention housing. We have a capital city that grinds to a halt every day gridlocked. On Monday, we saw a terrifying report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that revealed to us how dangerous is our course as a country and as a world This is where we are. Last Monday's report was not a wake-up call; it was a siren - a screeching alarm that the Government cannot ignore - yet all the evidence seems to be that this is exactly what the Government intends to do. It is a stubborn refusal to listen to a reality that is staring it in the face and screaming.If there is one thing we can say for certain about Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance, it is that they are terrified of real change. They are terrified of system change. Reform is not something for which they have any time. However, the report published on Monday showed that we cannot keep going along the same road and the Government needs to accept that fact. Yet, in his speech yesterday, it took the Minister 55 minutes before he substantively mentioned climate action, in the section right after betting. That states very clearly where this Government’s priorities lie. There are many terms we associate with how Fine Gael likes to talk about the economy: prudence is one of them. They talk about prudence all the time, and condescendingly criticise Deputies on this side of the House for not being prudent and not dealing with reality. However, this budget does not display prudence, it has populism at its heart. It was very clear after the report on Monday that the ones ignoring reality are the members of the Government themselves. On housing, the Minister has again proven that the only thing the Government recycles is announcements. Yesterday the Minister announced an increase of 10,000 homes to be built next year, but this increase would only be 2,100 homes, as the other nearly 8,000 houses had already been announced under Rebuilding Ireland. Today the Dublin Inquirer reported that what the Government considered to be an affordable housing scheme, and which they were working on for two years before it was shelved, is a scheme which would have been based on giving cash subsidies to landlords. Remarkably, the Government is still convinced that the private market will fix this crisis. That can be seen in the announcement of €1.25 billion for delivery of 10,000 new social homes in 2019, which seems to include rentals and acquisitions, and therefore, given that the rent assistance programmes cost €950 million in 2018 and are increasing every year by €150 million, it seems very likely that the additional €121 million will just cover rent inflation for current HAP tenancies. The fact that the HAP programme has been Government’s most successful aspect of Rebuilding Ireland, combined with further tax relief for landlords in yesterday’s budget shows exactly where Fine Gael’s priorities lie, namely, with landlords and not with tenants. They are going back to landlords yet again with more giveaways, in the mistaken belief this is a long-term solution to the housing and rental crisis. This approach has failed for seven straight years. I do not understand why the Government thinks it will work this time. What the Government declares to be a success in terms of the HAP is lost in the reality that every day, 50 new people or families enter into rental distress and need to avail of the scheme. With rents going up and up, often by more than the 4% annual cap, which is not adequately enforced, and no real security of tenure for many renters, it is entirely a landlords’ market. It is because of this that it is tenants who are the ones entering into rental distress in their droves, as the Government refuses to take steps to properly strengthen their rights. There is still little to no detail on what will be built on the State lands that are being made available, and nothing to convince us that the Government is turning away from the market-led approach to any degree that will see the scale of home building we need. The announcement of a scheme for houses affected by mica in Donegal, while welcome for those affected, only highlights the Government’s unwillingness to deal with the scope of the issue of legacy defects. Where is the scheme for those who, due to the reckless actions of cowboy builders, have been forced to rectify defects, fire safety and structural defects, that is, those who, through no fault of their own, have been left with dangerous homes and substantial bills? Instead, we get a true Fine Gael way of tackling the problem, by dealing with one small aspect and leaving everyone else out in the cold. The Government cannot pick and choose who it helps based on which Minister lobbies the loudest. It is not fair to the people who the Minister refuses to meet.  Taispeánann an budget seo easpa uaillmhéine an Rialtais i leith phobal na Gaeltachta. Is cúis díomá é nach bhfuil ach €5 milliún sa bhreis á chur leis an nGaeilge agus an nGaeltacht agus muid i mBliain na Gaeilge. Níl aon rud ann faoi ghéarchéim tithíochta na Gaeltachta agus níl ach €1.5 milliún d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i ngaireacht scread asail don mhéid atá ag teastáil chun infreastruchtúr cuí a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht.  On mental health, while it was positive to hear yesterday in the Chamber that there would be an increase of €84 million in mental health investment, after looking at the budget document itself I can only see €55 million in extra spend outlined. Where is the discrepancy of €29 million? We need clarity on this and we need clarity on the breakdown of spend. I note that my colleague on the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, Deputy Rabbitte, is in the Chamber. She can confirm how the committee repeatedly has tried to determine where the money allocated to mental services has been spent. It is essential that the money is spent on developing services, increasing staffing and cutting waiting times. We need accountability and clarity, both in the amount allocated and how it is allocated. In education, there has been an increase in the capitation grant by 5%, but for schools it equates to just 4 cent per student per day, and continues to leave schools well below the capitation grant levels of 2010, leaving the voluntary contribution in place, burdening parents with the increasing costs of not only sending children to school but keeping the schools afloat. The increase in teacher numbers, and particularly the increase in funding for additional special needs assistants, is to be welcomed, but that feeling fades as soon as one realises these increases only just cover the basic needs that exist. This is not an investment for the future or putting a focus on education; this is just barely keeping up.  Things are even worse at third level where the increases are not even enough to keep up with growing demand. The additional €57 million in current funding is entirely inadequate. We are less than three years away from the Cassells report’s first major benchmark, as an additional €600 million per annum from 2021 will be required to keep the higher education sector afloat. Yet, the Minister for State with responsibility for higher education announced yesterday that this budget will change the landscape of third-level education in Ireland and that the Government listened to all the voices in the sector. I am dumbfounded by how out of touch the Minister is. The Union of Students in Ireland has declared it is extremely disappointed in the budget, saying it does little to nothing for students. The Irish Universities Association stated it was “patent nonsense for the Minister to continue to talk about having the ‘best education system in Europe by 2026’ while presiding over a funding regime that only provides a fraction of the funding per student of those best countries in Europe”, and "It is a serious cause of concern that the government has not prioritised the education of the future workforce of the country.” The Irish Federation of University Teachers criticised the budget for falling far, far short of the resources needed under the Cassells report. The Teachers Union of Ireland called the investment in higher education in budget 2019 "woefully inadequate". Who exactly did the Minister of State listen to if she did not listen to the universities, the students, or the teachers? The Government needs to stop seeing education as a cost and to see it is an investment in our future. To truly invest in our children's future, we must value our teachers and ensure that they get equal pay for equal work. However, as with their actions with regard to climate action, the Government seems uninterested in thinking about our future, it is only interested in what is popular right now. This budget is the indication of a Government that is far off course. The Government continues to insist that we are on the right path when it comes to climate change, but the reality is it does not care, and apathy is more dangerous than denial when it comes to climate change. In the aftermath of Monday’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, this budget was an opportunity to be at the forefront and to lead in the climate action that is needed. Instead, members of the Government should hang their heads in shame as that lack of leadership is putting our children’s future at risk. This will not be remembered as a budget for our society, for equality, for our environment or for our children, but as a missed opportunity and a dangerous step in the wrong direction by a Government blind to the biggest challenge facing all of us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, issued a stark and frightening report on humanity's impact on the world around us. The day after the report was published, the Government did a U-turn on carbon tax. Carbon tax is not the be-all and end-all of climate action and it needs to be balanced with supports to stop fuel poverty. This move showed exactly where the Government's priorities lie. As Professor John FitzGerald has said, carbon pricing alone will not deliver the necessary emission reductions but delivering emission reductions without a sufficient carbon price will almost be impossible and much more expensive. The Government has a Minister with responsibility for climate action who did not even seek an increase in the carbon tax in the budget. He should resign on that issue alone and that is before we get into the issues of the impropriety of his dining habits. The Government has a national development plan, NDP, which has not been climate-proofed. At meetings of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, three Secretaries General have looked like deer in the headlights when asked how we will close the 100 million tonne emissions gap. The Government has a transport plan that is all roads, roads and more roads. The NDP provides for more than 60 motorways or national road projects. There is not a single major public transport project in construction today. With the exception of the Royal Canal greenway, there is not a single cycling project in construction today. The Government keeps pushing public transport projects into the future. It delayed metro north by a decade. The DART Interconnector is in the plan for after 2027, if at all, and the Navan railway line, which was ready to go, is also on the long finger for at least another decade. What is the public transport plan for the Tánaiste's city of Cork? The Government's tokenistic actions on climate and environment have been woeful. Last month, Fine Gael launched its very own green week. The irony of having a single green week where the party deflected its own shameful lack of real action on climate issues onto the people seems to have been totally lost on Fine Gael. The Taoiseach highlights the benefits of switching to a reusable coffee cup while, at the same time, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment continues to block the Green Party's Waste Reduction Bill.The Government has opposed our Bill and the Labour Party Bill to ban microbeads, has opposed Deputy Bríd Smith's climate emergency Bill, and has continually declared that Ireland is open for business when it comes to fossil fuel extraction. At the end of the day, on the international stage, Ireland is the second worst performer in the EU on climate change. We are bottom of the class. The Ministers assure us we will have massive reductions in our emissions by 2030 but no one can see that. The Committee on Climate Action says we are completely off course, and the Environmental Protection Agency predicts our emissions in 2035 will be higher than they are today, yet we are presented with a national development plan with no idea of climate impact. Does the Government accept that the national development plan is not fit for purpose? It is not climate-proofed, it is not real climate action and it needs to change.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Monday's report was obviously not a wake-up call for Government. In Cork, all that the Government has agreed is to expand the road network. To return to my main question, the national development plan is not a plan to achieve a low-carbon economy and it is not fit for purpose. This is my main question today to the Minister. Will he admit it is not fit for purpose? No strategic environmental assessment was carried out for the national development plan. There was only one for the national planning framework but, most importantly, it did not provide a quantitative level of emissions reductions at all - no numbers and no target. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment spends so much time talking about the one in five euro that will be spent on climate action under the national development plan, as the Tánaiste has just mentioned also, but they fail to note that €13 billion of that €21 billion was already committed by the ESB to standard energy expenditure anyway. The budget provided for €25 million for retrofitting the State's stock of 150,000. We need €5 billion. At this rate, it will take 40 years. The Government is not serious about climate change, or at least that is what all the evidence suggests. If I am wrong and the Government cares, will it lead and take action? Limiting climate change to 1.5° Celsius is a matter of survival for us all. It is not about the distant future. We have 12 years for this Government to show leadership and take brave and bold political decisions. Does it have that courage? If it does, it should take the brave and bold step here in the Dáil today and admit that the national development plan is not fit for purpose and it needs to change.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Where are the figures? We cannot see them if they are not there.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not want this Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government must lead.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Hear, hear.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ba mhaith liom gach rath a ghuí ar an Aire ina ról nua. I wish the Minister well in his new role and thank him for engaging so positively with the joint committee earlier on the important topic of mental health promotion in our schools. This question relates to the capitation grant, which was increased by 5% in the recent budget. The primary and secondary school capitation grant is still well below the 2010 level. Does the Minister intend to restore the grant fully in line with the commitment in the 2016-19 action plan for education? If so, what is the timeline for that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appreciate that the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, had to consider which of the many issues he faced he should prioritise. Schools have been pleading for capitation increases for many years. The increase in the recent budget was something, but it was very small. Capitation grant funding is still well below where it was in 2010. It is hardly surprising that the INTO has described it as a "pittance", given that it equates to just 4.6 cent per student per day. As the ASTI has stated, the increase will merely keep up with growing student numbers. It is simply not adequate for the real costs of running schools in Ireland today. Principals are under huge financial stress as they seek to make the money stretch. School costs in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown can be higher, but principals have the same amount of money per student to work with as principals in every other part of the country. Schools are buckling under this weight. We spoke at the joint committee about relieving the stress that is being experienced by teachers and principals. The stress in this area could be relieved by means of proper restoration of the capitation grant. According to the action plan, this was supposed to begin in 2017 and was to happen over three years. However, it now appears that the first sign of an increase will be in 2019. What is the clear timeline on which principals, parents and teachers can rely?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appreciate the Minister's commitment. Along with my colleagues on the joint committee, I will hold him to it because actions speak louder than words. The committee held a specific summer school on school costs in September. The impacts of diminished capitation grants are twofold.First, principals are continually stretched beyond the beyond in order to make the most of the money they receive. This is complicated by the minor works grant being announced later each year. It appears that there will be no grant for 2018 and that it will instead come in 2019. That is a major stress on schools when they are trying to work out where everything goes. Second, the pressure placed on parents to cover the gap through voluntary contributions was emphasised at the summer school. We are burdening parents not just with the increasing costs of sending their children to school, with uniforms, books, etc., but also with trying to keep the schools afloat. That is not acceptable. Parents receive an annual letter from schools seeking voluntary contributions, but these are far from voluntary. I need to see action soon. What our principals need now are fewer of the circulars like those to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred and more investment in schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move:"That Dáil Éireann:acknowledges the gravity of the crisis caused for wildlife and for rivers, lakes and oceans by the quantities of plastics which are finding their way into the environment;recognises that the production of each tonne of plastic causes the emission of six tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere;notes the success of deposit and return schemes in other jurisdictions;emphasises the importance of the 'polluter pays' principle and the transition to a circular economy;calls on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to exercise his powers under the Waste Management Act 1996 to:— establish a deposit and return scheme for closed drinks containers, subject to any appropriate exemptions;— require those who produce or import such containers or put them on the market to cover the costs of operating the scheme in line with the established practice of producer responsibility;— impose a general ban on single use plastic items such as plastic cutlery, straws, stirrers and other tableware, with appropriate exemptions for medical and other essential uses;— impose a two-tier levy on disposable cups for beverages etc., of €0.15 for noncompostable coffee cups and €0.05 for compostable coffee cups; and— devote the proceeds of this levy to public awareness and to the development of infrastructure for effective disposal of compostable coffee cups and other compostable materials; andcalls on the Government to:— recognise the support which the Dáil and the Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment gave to the Waste Reduction Bill 2017; and— approve the issuing of a money message for the Waste Reduction Bill 2017."How did we get here? It is beyond frustrating that it has come to the point that Deputy Eamon Ryan and I have to bring the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 again before the Dáil. This Government has blocked and obstructed at every stage the opportunity for this Dáil and, in particular, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to do their job, to deliver and to work with legislation that has passed Second Stage. The former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, consistently refused to issue a money order for the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 because this Government does not want to act on climate change. My understanding is that the new Minister with that responsibility will maintain that refusal tonight and take the cynical step of kicking the can down the road with a national review.  This Government does not want to take action on plastic pollution. It does not want to take action on the health of our seas or our environment. It seems to have to be dragged kicking and screaming as slowly and reluctantly as possible into the tiniest amount of climate action it can possibly get away with. Children in primary and secondary schools up and down the country are doing more than the Government to protect our environment. So many people get it. It is a pity and a shame that the Government would not take its lead from the youth of our country who are demanding action on plastic waste. The Minister needs to sit up and take notice because he is way behind the curve on this.  We do not have much time to deal with these problems and challenges. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC's, report two weeks ago showed us that the clock is ticking on climate action. We have 12 years to make a difference. By the time the Government waits around and twiddles its thumbs with a review, as it did when my Green Party colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, put forward a Bill to ban microbeads two years ago, which it is only getting around to introducing now, our precious marine environments will be even more beset with plastic. We will reach a point not that far into the future when we will have to change our phrases and idioms. It will be a case of "there is plenty more plastic in the sea" because plastic will outweigh fish. We have seen time and again when the cameras are on Ministers that they say the right thing and run slick public relations campaigns but away from the bright lights, they do not care. In a keynote speech to the European Parliament and during his election campaign to become leader of Fine Gael, the Taoiseach made all the right noises and said all the right thing. He said climate action would be his main focus. Ireland would be a laggard no more, he proclaimed, but we are further behind than ever before. Similarly with this Bill the Government says the right things in Dáil debates. It briefs the media on the issue positively but when the substantive work needs to be done in the committee rooms, it is a different story. The Government shamefully uses administrative manoeuvres to block progress. The truth is it is more interesting in protecting itself and its electoral prospects than protecting our rivers, streams, seas and lakes.  This is an important Bill. It tackles the core of the plastic problem that plagues our country and our world - the trillions of disposable products that are used for just a few minutes but can pollute our environment for centuries. We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment, killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats. It is vital that we act and just as vital that we take that action now. In Ireland, we produce 210,000 tonnes of plastic every year and according to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, only 40% of plastic packaging is recycled. Ireland uses and disposes of 200 million coffee cups annually. The measures in this Bill are necessary and the Government knows that, so what exactly is it afraid of? Does it simply not get it or not want to get it? It is disgracefully nonchalant about one of the most critical challenges facing us. This is an opportunity to lead but the Government is content to wait until it is pushed when these measures become mandatory under EU rules.  The public knows these measures are necessary. We watched "Drowning in Plastic" on BBC and we watched "Blue Planet II" in horror. We read the story of the whale that died from eating more than 80 pieces of plastic rubbish. We have seen the photographs of a stork trapped in a plastic bag and of a turtle with a straw trapped in its nose. The Irish people know we need to take action for our future and our children's future. They believe we can still make a difference. They want to make a difference and we can have change.  The Waste Reduction Bill 2017 presents an opportunity to have a positive impact on tackling plastic waste but the Government has chosen cynical further delaying tactics like the national review it will shortly outline, further slowing down the process of change. That is not a surprise given its appalling track record on protecting our environment. Its national development plan was not even climate-proofed. The Minister's party, Fine Gael, recently had a green week not comprehending the irony of giving a single week in the year to being selectively green, where it tried to pass the blame and responsibility for its own policy failings to the people of Ireland, deflecting its own failures. The Taoiseach highlighted the benefits of switching to a reusable coffee cup while Government is blocking the Waste Reduction Bill 2018. The level of shallow doublespeak, contradictions and evasive inconsistencies beggars belief. All the facts and figures about plastic that I have just outlined, and that my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and Deputies around this House, will reference over the next two hours have been outlined in this House previously.  We held a Second Stage debate on this Bill facilitated by the Labour Party, and the Oireachtas committee has done detailed work on investigating and analysing the impact this Bill would have, recommending that it progress to the next Stage. Parties across the political spectrum and Independents, including Senators and Members of the European Parliament, have called for similar schemes and the Bill is supported by 60 Tidy Towns committees and the Friends of the Earth 'Sick of Plastic' campaign petition which has more than 15,000 signatures. However, the Government refuses to allow the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 to progress. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I wish him well in his new role but I am afraid it will likely disappoint anyone who cares about plastic waste. I believe Government intends to abstain on our motion and to initiate a review on the best way to tackle this issue. Is that not what Committee Stage is for? Is it not to tease through legislation forensically and tweak it to make it as fair and effective as possible? The best way to make progress on this issue is to listen to all the experts, activists, youth of our country, schoolchildren and legislators and respect the voice of the Dáil to issue the money order for the Waste Reduction Bill 2017 and let the members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment do their job.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Táim sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don mBille seo. From the GAA to Tidy Towns to meals on wheels, Ireland's strength lies in our community spirit and activism. The Green Party has always believed that Ireland can be a leader on renewable energy by allowing communities themselves to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy, not just large private companies. We have long championed a payment for community microgeneration and introduced a pilot payment scheme in 2009 which the next Government regrettably removed in 2014. We welcome this Bill as it is in line with recommendations made in our submission to the public consultation on the new renewable electricity support scheme and our own Community Energy (Co-ownership) Bill 2017. Our Bill lays out guidelines for a community co-operative investment model to accompany the mandatory offer of shares to local people. The Green Party's community co-ownership model is based on a successful Danish scheme which has resulted in greater community engagement in the transition to a renewable economy in Denmark. Since 2009, the Danish renewable energy act requires all new wind projects to be at least 20% owned by local people. We have also introduced on First Stage in the Dáil the Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill to oversee the implementation of the EU's new governance of the energy union package and Ireland's national energy and climate plan, ensuring that climate action is taken in a manner that is just and fair to workers, local communities and farmers. Renewable energy is the only way forward for our climate, planet and future. It is essential that as we move towards a greener economy, the transition is fair and community-led. This Bill will enable households, small businesses and farmers to receive payments from electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The Bill has the support of Friends of the Earth, Stop Climate Chaos, An Taisce and Trócaire. We need to ensure that any payment is provided in a fair and just manner. The Green Party will therefore make amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that the Bill does not encourage the wealthiest to go off grid while leaving the poorest reliant on ever-increasing energy prices produced by fossil fuel-heavy utilities. Ireland is at its best at the community level. With the payment for microgeneration, Irish communities could develop their own local power plants, from the roof of the local school, community hall or farm shed, and become active participants in the energy transformation we so desperately need. Energy should be viewed as a public good and a service to society, not a mere commodity. Ireland has the fourth highest electricity prices in the EU and, during the summer, the electricity suppliers again raised their prices. Irish citizens are treated as economic resources to extract from, but we should be democratic owners and participants in the great renewable energy transition. We must also recognise that reducing our energy use is where the largest amount of success can be had on climate action, providing high-quality jobs and reducing energy poverty. The Government needs to take real climate action to protect citizens from unnecessary deaths from cold and bad housing; to transfer State bodies such as Bord na Móna from exploiting peat to long-term, high-quality jobs in providing high-quality, warm and nearly zero energy homes; to launch a long-term plan to retrofit housing across the State, taking leadership and creating a positive market in the process; and to empower local communities to be integral parts of a just transition to a new green economy. Tonight's Bill is a good step in the right direction and the Green Party is happy to give it support.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Táim sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. I am delighted to support the Bill and I commend the ongoing work of Senator Bacik, who has long been a champion of women's rights, on introducing it. While there has been much change in society over the past few decades and many barriers to gender equality have been broken down, this does not mean we can afford to be complacent. Structural and cultural issues that prevent true gender equality remain and they must be overcome through positive measures such as the Bill. It has been more than 40 years since Ireland introduced the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act and yet the most recent CSO figures show that, on average, women in this country are paid 14% less than men. There are many complex reasons such a difference persists, despite laws to prevent gender pay discrimination. Fortunately, overt discrimination has become less frequent, but there continues to be significant gender segregation by occupation and the undervaluing of occupations in sectors that are predominantly female.  Gender equality, like all matters of equality, cannot be achieved by passive acts. It must be won through positive action. We can write the words on paper and pass laws calling for an end to discrimination but without active enforcement, follow-up, research and work, we cannot overcome the more subtle problems. The Bill will work to tackle these subtleties through the collection of data. Detail will show us exactly where problems lie and inform us how we must tackle them. In particular, I welcome the Bill’s call for companies with more than 50 employees to publish information on the proportion of male and female employees in the lower, lower middle, upper-middle and upper-quartile pay bands. There are many organisations where, while men and women on the same band are paid equally, women comprise the majority of the lower pay levels and men the majority of the upper pay levels. Last year we learned this was the case for Departments, where women fail to break through to upper and managerial levels. With data we can learn how systemic this is and develop the policies and supports necessary to address it.  Ending the pay gap will not only be beneficial for women; rather, it will be beneficial to the economy at large. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that cutting the pay gap could boost OECD economies by €4.9 trillion. I hope the measures outlined in this Bill will be extended to cover companies and enterprises with fewer than 50 employees and ensure that areas with precarious employment, in which women are more likely to be employed than men, are monitored and assessed for gender biases. There is much more work to be done to value women’s work across all sectors and advance gender equality, which is a priority of the Oireachtas women's parliamentary caucus. Senator Bacik’s Bill will make a significant positive impact in addressing gender pay issues.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	David Attenborough's words at COP24 earlier this week echoed around the world when he stated that the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon. Regrettably the Government is full of announcements and plans and we have seen very little real action. Senior Ministers cannot even be bothered to turn up for these statements. It shows their complete lack of interest in the most urgent challenge facing humanity. Sometimes I feel my eight year old daughter has more interest in and shows more climate change action than some of the Ministers in the Government. It is the children who are born now who will be affected. We are not talking about our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It is children who are born now who will suffer. The Government's national mitigation plan has 41 actions due for 2018, yet 20 of them are reported in the annual transition statement as not having been completed. The Government's national development plan, the vaunted Project Ireland 2040, was not even climate proofed. All the while, the Government's progress in decreasing our emissions towards the targets we have committed to has been glacially slow. It has been dragged kicking and screaming into even the tiniest of climate action measures. The Government's rhetoric keeps getting stronger and louder, but its actions continue to fail, as exemplified by the determination to build a third runway at Dublin Airport, build even more motorways across the country and extract more oil and gas from our seas. The Environmental Protection Agency's emissions statistics released yesterday show that while our overall greenhouse gas emissions decreased marginally from 2016 to 2017, they are not falling fast enough. This change, which is less than 1%, can be primarily attributed to the reduced use of Moneypoint power station and a warm winter in 2017, rather than any new policy measures from Government. The bottom line is that we are way off target. It is not all doom and gloom. There is a path and there are actions that can be taken if there is the political will and courage to take them. We need political courage from everyone in this House to call for and agree on a path for our country. There is no room for populist politics in the real climate action that is needed. The Government needs to make a seismic shift from concentration on road infrastructure to focusing on spending on public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure. It needs to invest in real alternatives to cars in cities and rural areas. The Government needs to focus on a sustainable model of land use based on diversification, food security, carbon efficiency and the protection of biodiversity, rather than focusing solely on agriculture that seeks to meet demand for its own sake. We must protect small farmers, young farmers and family farmers. This is essential not only for the environment but also to provide a fairer living for farmers, instead of maintaining a status quo that is catered to and serves only the big meat processors and retailers at the cost of the small farmer. The Government needs to provide real opportunities for people who want to be green and to save energy. It is the Minister's job to make it easy for us to be green. He needs to fast-track Sinn Féin's Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill in order that those who want to invest in solar panels can be paid back for their investment while supplying the grid with clean energy. The Government needs to stop blocking my party's Waste Reduction Bill. I strongly believe the people of Ireland want to make a real change. The Citizens' Assembly findings showed just how willing and eager Irish people are to turn this into a country that leads on climate action instead of one that is left behind. Despite the Citizens' Assembly and the community organisations and businesses throughout the country that are focused on building a better, cleaner, greener future, it is sadly becoming ever more difficult for even the most ardent optimists among us to believe that this Government has any intention of sincerely tackling climate change.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The key message coming from COP 24 is that climate change is moving faster than we are and that we have to catch up before it is too late. However, Ireland is actually going backwards. Our commitments require us to reduce our emissions by 1 million tonnes per year, but instead they have increased by 2.1 million tonnes per year. Yesterday we got our latest climate change report card, the climate change performance index. For the second year in a row - twice under the watch of the present Taoiseach - we are ranked bottom of the class. Ireland is the worst performer on climate action in the EU. It is embarrassing, disgraceful and shameful. Despite all the years of talk and Government announcements about the need to transition to a low-carbon economy, it has been a case of more talk and glitzy announcements than any real action. The report stated: "The long-standing lack of implementation of substantive measures to put the country on a well-below-2°C pathway results in a very low rating for Ireland’s national policy performance". That is basically a technical way of saying that Ireland may talk the talk and spin the spin, but it certainly does not walk the walk, which is the responsibility of the Taoiseach. Leaders must lead and the people do not want to see our country continually trailing in climate action. It is an unfair reflection of their concerns. The people are way ahead of Government on this. The Government is out of sync with Irish and global concerns and the demands for real climate action. It is all well and good to produce plans, roadmaps and recommendations, but they are of no use if they are not followed and if they do not have cold hard figures to back them up. If the Government were serious about climate action, why would it launch Project Ireland 2040 when it has not been climate proofed? Everything in the plan is wonderfully vague when it comes to climate impacts. Whenever I or one of my colleagues on this side of the House asks the Taoiseach or anyone in government for information on how they plan to tackle climate change, we get the same response: that €1 in every €5 under the national development plan is being spent on climate action initiatives. However, the climate action committee has been told that 60% of that €1 in €5 is already committed energy expenditure, meaning that the €1 in €5 appears to be a sham. Today I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the other €4 in €5. How does he know what the impact of our greenhouse gas emissions of non-climate related spending under Project Ireland 2040 will be when there are no real numbers in the plan? There are no projected emission reductions, no identification of any real climate proofing. I ask the Taoiseach to give me the number for our projected emission reductions under Project Ireland 2040. I do not want vague plans and more announcements today; I want real numbers. If the Taoiseach does not have the numbers, does he intend to do that analysis?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am certainly not saying that the national development plan on its own will solve climate change. It certainly will not do so when it has not even been climate-proofed, which is the main point. The EPA's recent report states that emissions have decreased. I am glad the Taoiseach accepts that this is due to the mild winter. Another reason is the reduction in fuel tourism because of Brexit's impact on the pound. The underlying trend is that we are still way off target but at least the Taoiseach has not tried to take credit for the weather, which would be a whole new level of spin. The recent reductions are certainly not due to Government action. We are 3 million tonnes off where we promised to be under European effort-sharing agreements and at the current carbon market prices, this would cost us some €60 million. That cost is only going to increase, year on year. In terms of plans and the all-of-Government plan to which the Taoiseach referred, at this stage people are suffering from Government climate action spin fatigue and plan fatigue. Under the national mitigation plan for this year, only 21 of the 40 actions have been completed. As I said, the national development plan has not been climate proofed. The national energy and climate plan must be submitted to Europe by the end of the month but, as recently as last week, Departments were unable to outline any additional measure being undertaken to close the emissions gap. The current national development plan is not fit for purpose. Restoring Ireland's reputation will require that the new national energy and climate action plan replaces Project Ireland 2040. This should include a new land use element which commits us to a new future for Irish farms, forestry and bogs. It should promise a radically different transport system which promotes walking, cycling and public transport ahead of road construction. Of course, we also need to divest from fossil fuels. This would ignite our economy but it requires leadership. Everybody matters in making this just transition, which is why my party has published a just transition Bill. If it can be done, it will only be done if the Taoiseach and his Government changes track and gets serious about this. The Government must lead and must prioritise tackling the most serious threat to us all.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am fatigued with plans. I am fatigued with Government spin and plans. It is nothing but plan after plan after plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The programme for Government committed to the recruiting of additional teachers within a reformed and better managed public service. Earlier today, parents in a primary school in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown received a message from the principal stating, "In the new year there will be teaching vacancies in our school. These positions have been advertised repeatedly over the last three months without a single reply." This is an appalling position for a principal of the school to be put in with regard to managing her school. It is an appalling position for the teachers, given the extra pressure of operating in a school that has a shortage of staff. Most importantly, it is appalling for the children who have to attend a school where there will not be enough teachers to properly provide the best possible education for those children. This school will, of course, continue to try its hardest to fill those vacancies but the fact remains many schools across the country are dealing with the same issue.Pay inequality is very much part of the problem as students are refusing to join the teaching profession while, for the same reasons, young teachers are walking away from it. What measures is the Government adopting to tackle teacher shortages?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a primary school.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On behalf of the Green Party and on behalf of the Oireachtas women’s parliamentary caucus, I extend my deepest sympathies to the family, relatives and friends of Monica Barnes. Ba mhaith liom ómós a thabhairt do Mhonica Barnes, laoch pearsanta domsa agus bean a bhí ar an scoil chéanna liomsa. Mar Sheanadóir agus mar Theachta, las sí soilse do mhná sa pholaitíocht nuair a bhí sé an-deacair dúinn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh. Sa seacht mí ó cailleadh í tá cácas na mban ag dul ó neart go neart, agus tá rian agus oidhreacht Mhonica le braith iontu siúd. Monica was a towering figure, a woman who made a difference and left a lasting impression, a fearless advocate. It is crucial that we remember that she was a fearless advocate in a very different time, in a less kind Ireland, in what was at the time a judgmental Ireland. It was a completely different place. But it never deterred her pioneering voice from articulating in a most persuasive way what she believed in. On a personal note, I have lost a fellow past pupil from our shared alma mater in the Barony of Farney, namely, St. Louis secondary school in Carrickmacross. Monica travelled to school from the neighbouring town of Kingscourt, as did many of my school friends when I was a student in St. Louis. As a young pupil there, I found her inspirational and we were very proud that she was the first past pupil from our school to be elected to Dáil Éireann. The last time I spoke to Monica was in Áras an Uachtaráin on International Women’s Day this year, when we took a photo together to mark the fact that we were the two past pupils of St. Louis who were elected to the Dáil. When I established the Oireachtas women’s parliamentary caucus last year, Monica’s campaigning voice was ever present. More importantly, her belief and support were invaluable and unwavering in reminding us in the caucus that although we may have come far since her days in Leinster House and have increased our representation in the Oireachtas, there is a long way to go. While we have all lost a dear friend, the greatest tribute we can make to Monica is to continue her pioneering work for women. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Paddy Harte. I concur with the comments made by others. The President recently spoke of the State's at times selective amnesia but Paddy Harte was never in that category. In respect of true reconciliation, he was ahead of his time. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is nearly a year since the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published the Safe as Houses report, which recommended that the Government set up a scheme to remediate legacy defects in residential buildings. The Dáil called for same when it passed a Green Party motion in June 2017. Some affected homeowners from my constituency in Dublin Rathdown are currently outside Leinster House, marking another year with no movement from the Government on this issue. When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in October, he said that the Minister of State, Deputy English, was examining proposals and he admitted that there must be an understanding of the extent of the defects across the country so that such proposals could be drawn up. Has the Government made any moves towards investigating the extent of the latent defects in residential housing, with a view to drawing up a plan for practical State reliefs along the lines recommended in the Safe as Houses report and the Green Party motion on building standards or are the homeowners to remain abandoned by the Government?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are other proposals.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am arguing for a site value tax.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to provide for the establishment of thermal efficiency standards for rented accommodation, for the testing of rented accommodation for radon, for the remediation of rented accommodation with high concentrations of radon; and to provide for related matters.The Green Party's Healthy Homes Bill 2019 is vital step to ensure homes are safer and warmer for those who rent. The Bill proposes to require the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to make regulations to require private landlords to test their properties for the presence of radon and remediate them if necessary. It proposes also to require the Minister to make regulations to impose thermal comfort and efficiency standards such as a minimum building energy rating. Currently, there is no obligation on landlords to take either of these steps, and as the measures only benefit the tenant, there is little incentive for them to undertake the work either. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which is colourless and odourless and can only be detected using specialised equipment. It is linked to between 280 and 300 lung cancer cases in Ireland every year. That represents 10% of lung cancer cases. Testing for radon costs just €50 and involves simply leaving a monitoring device in a home for three months before returning it to a laboratory. Remediation, where necessary, generally costs under €1,000. In many of the areas in which radon levels are high, the rental market is such that €1,000 is no more than one month's rent. All that happens at the moment is that local authorities ask landlords whether they have tested for radon. Fingal County Council, for example, reported that in the previous five years in respect of 559 properties, not one landlord replied to say radon levels had been tested. Quentin Crowley of Trinity College Dublin estimates that more than 30% of the national building stock is in high radon risk areas and that more than 460,000 people, or 10% of the population, may be living in homes with high radon gas concentrations. The Bill seeks to oblige the Minister to implement an action which the Government itself adopted in the national radon control strategy of 2014 but failed to include when reviewing standards for rented houses in 2017. This is a vital measure to strengthen the right of tenants to live in safe homes. The second aspect of the Bill will ensure that tenants can live in warm, energy-efficient homes. Everyone agrees that we need to upgrade the vast proportion of our housing stock to improve living conditions, save on fuel bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.While Government policies include some measure of State-sponsored retrofit of social housing and incentives for homeowners to insulate their houses, there has been almost no retrofitting of private rented accommodation. This is due to the split incentive whereby the landlord would pay for the installation but the tenant would be the person to benefit. If we do not introduce minimum standards, many households and tenants will continue to live in substandard accommodation and some will end up in fuel poverty due to the energy inefficiency of their houses and apartments. The Bill requires the Minister to create regulations by the end of this year, but as the cost of retrofitting can vary greatly from property to property, we envisage a transition period prior to the minimum thermal efficiency standards becoming applicable to all rental properties. These are two issues we need to start tackling as soon as possible, and I urge everyone to support the Bill in order that we can guarantee safer and warmer homes for renters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Like many people, including other Members, I am proud to have family and close friends who are nurses. I am the daughter of a midwife and the sister of a neonatal nurse and am acutely aware of the incredible work nurses do. I was delighted to join them on the picket line in Tallaght today because the work they do is among the toughest and most vitally important work undertaken by any group of people in this country. They undertake that work day in and day out. Does the Minister accept that not being able to find adequate numbers to work in the nursing profession presents an overarching health and safety concern, a crisis and an emergency? Why would one continue to work in a system in which pay is too low, conditions are in need of vast improvement and, crucially, there is no sign of change? That is the situation nurses face. Our nurses are second to none but the system is failing them and their patients. It is primarily a matter of pay, justice, fairness and equity. Pay is at the heart of this dispute and for Government to make an abysmal offer through the media to settle the pay dispute by excluding pay from negotiations is inflammatory, idiotic and insulting. It shows grossly poor judgment and a worrying absence of any understanding of the plight of nurses and midwives. Will the Minister admit that statement was insulting and wrong and apologise for it? Will he commit to engaging, in a meaningful way, with the general secretary of the nurses' union?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Can I ask a question? The Taoiseach did not answer-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Taoiseach certainly does not care about the environment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This week many homeowners and management companies of defective buildings, who were led down a path by the Government in relation to securing loan funding for the remediation of latent defects caused by rogue developers during the boom years, found that the path set out by the Government led straight into a brick wall. The Minister for Finance indicated in an answer to a parliamentary question in December that the Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, scheme would be in a position to consider applications from this month by apartment owners and management companies to undertake remedial works on latent defects, but it turns out that it is closed to assisting homeowners who face the appalling prospect of having to undertake work on their own coin just to make their homes safe. Department of Finance correspondence to a Government Minister from November of last year states that “there is nothing contained in the HBFI legislation that would prevent such a funding application being considered.” Now, however, it seems there is. The HBFI is not able to imagine a situation where a remediation application would be funded, due to the possibility of further estimated costs once remediation is commenced if further issues present, and the inability of most management companies to provide security beyond personal guarantees from apartment owners. I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that apartment owners have been led up a blind alley by the Government. Will the Minister of State please tell the House what happened here? Did the Government really not understand its own legislation well enough honestly to tell people affected by latent defects that there was not a snowball’s chance in hell that the HBFI fund would be of any use to them? Why would the Government direct them with this false hope? While the affected apartment owners and management companies deserve an answer as to why the one direction pointed out to them turned out to be a dead end, they also deserve a comprehensive and accurate answer as to what the Government intends to do to assist them. I first raised this issue in the Dáil with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, more than two years ago. A Green Party motion has since been backed by the Dáil to "prepare and publish options for the financing and carrying out of remedial works to defective housing units, that will form the basis for a nationwide scheme, enshrined in legislation, for the orderly remediation of legacy defects in housing." There has also been the cross-party Safe As Houses? report that called for a redress scheme to assist homeowners with latent defects and for an information and advice service for those affected by non-compliance and regulatory failure. The most straightforward part of the Safe As Houses? recommendation was the call to set up an advice service. After the fiasco of the Government's misinformation on the HBFI scheme it is clear that this type of service is needed more than ever.Has the Government even looked at doing it? Does the Government intend to conduct a review, as called for by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, to ascertain how widespread and serious the problem of defective builds across the country is and, if it has not, why not? One cannot accurately assess potential reliefs without a comprehensive picture of the problem. Does the Government intend to investigate, or has it already investigated, the possibility of the provision of any sort of assistance for affected homeowners in the form of an advice service or the provision by some other means of accurate information for people dealing with defects; some form of tax relief, in particular given the reliefs given currently to builders and developers and those engaged in a wide range of other activities, in the form of VAT relief on remediation works, income tax relief or property tax relief; a low-interest State loan fund to assist those who cannot pay for remedial works, or a redress scheme for the orderly remediation of latent defects?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With respect, these homeowners need more than an acknowledgment of their stress. With regard to the Home Building Finance Ireland scheme, the Minister of State said the Minister for Finance had been very clear, which he was. I have his remarks. He said nothing contained in the HBFI legislation prevented a funding application like this being considered. In reply to my parliamentary question, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, stated that the HBFI would be in a position to consider applications from apartment owners and management companies for such funding. The mixed messages here are cruel. Instead of giving people hope, the Government has given them a sense of hopelessness. They were given that hope and then the Government took it all away. I referred to four possible ways in which the Government could assist homeowners but it has done nothing. At this stage, every time I stand up to speak in the House, the Minister present presumes I am going to ask about helping these homeowners. That is how often I have raised the issue. However, the Government has done nothing. It has not even put in place a phone helpline for people who are in need. They do not know to whom to turn. It is abundantly clear that two years down the road, the Government is intent on abandoning these homeowners. I received a letter today from a person whose family member has been hit with an unexpected bill of more than €16,000 to fix fire safety issues at an apartment building. The bill was accompanied by a stern notice that the matter should not be discussed even with friends because if the media got to know about the problem, the property would be rendered unsaleable. People are terrified and, to its shame, the Government is thriving on that terror. The Government depends on the fear those people have about speaking out publicly because doing so might mean they will not only have to pay for the defects but their properties will be rendered unsaleable. That means no political pressure on the Government and, therefore, no problem. With respect, every time this matter raised, I hear about the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014. Let us not talk about those any more because they are of no help to these people.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a pre-2014 issue. I ask the Minister of State to accept as a fundamental principle that this is not simply a matter of private contract. For many of these homeowners, there is no recourse to builders and developers who have long since gone bust. Does the Minister of State accept that this is a public safety issue? The Government cannot simply sit idly by.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is it waiting for a tragedy to occur? Will it take a death? Fire alarms are going off in these buildings and people think their apartment complexes are going to burn down. They are living in fear and the Government must act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government must indicate that it intends to do something.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It means self-certification.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It does. The Minister says it does not, but it does. It is not robust.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Minister of State know how many apartments there are?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ar an 11 Feabhra seo caite, dúirt an Coimisinéir Teanga, Rónán Ó Domhnaill, go bhfuil sé "go hiomlán míshásúil" go bhfuil pobal na Gaeilge fós ag brath ar Acht teanga nach bhfuil "sách láidir". Tá breis is seacht mbliana caite ó cuireadh tús leis an bpróiseas leasú a dhéanamh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003. Tá sár-obair déanta ag Conradh na Gaeilge, ach go háirithe, moltaí a chur le chéile ar scéim ghinearálta agus ar cheannteidil Bille na dteangacha 2019. Cén uair a bheidh an Bille sin críochnaithe agus curtha chun cinn? An mbuailfidh an tAire le pobal na Gaeilge chun an Bhille a fheabhsú? Is í seo Seachtain na Gaeilge 2019 agus fós tá ríomhairí ag an Státseirbhís nach bhfuil in ann síneadh fada a chur ar ainm duine, fiú i liostaí de chuid an CSO. Tuigim an brú atá ar an Rialtas mar gheall ar an mBreatimeacht. Dúradh leis an Dáil seo nach raibh aon ghá ann Roinn na Gaeilge nó Údarás na Gaeltachta a lua sa reachtaíocht atá á tabhairt isteach chun déileáil leis an mBreatimeacht. Is beag an t-iontas go bhfuil imní ar an gCoimisinéir Teanga go gcaillfidh lucht labhartha na Gaeilge muinín as an bpróiseas reachtaíochta.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar Ghlasach, táim tiomanta chun ár n-acmhainní nádúrtha a chaomhnú. Meastar gurb í an Ghaeilge ceann de na hacmhainní is tábhachtaí atá againn sa tír seo. Feictear domsa, mar sin, go gcaitheann an Rialtas seo leis an teanga cosúil leis an gcaoi a gcaitheann sé le gach acmhainn nádúrtha eile atá againn: gan polasaí cuí chun í a chur chun cinn, agus ag brath an iomarca ar iarrachtaí pearsanta aonaracha. Is deas an rud é go ndearna an tAire Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta cúpla focal a léamh dúinn chun Seachtain na Gaeilge a cheiliúradh ach is í seo an tAire céanna nach gceapann go bhfuil an Ghaeilge thábhachtach go leor le foghlaim, cé go bhfuil sí freagrach aisti sa Rialtas. Is deas an rud go bhfuil €12 milliún le caitheamh ar cheantair Ghaeltachta faoin bplean 2040, ach tá sé sin an-bheag i gcomparáid le ceantair eile. Beidh €1 billiún le caitheamh ar cheantair thuaithe agus €2 billiún le caitheamh ar cheantair uirbeacha. Tá fáinne fí á chruthú ag an bpolasaí seo. Déantar níos lú infheistíochta sa Ghaeltacht, fágann an t-aos óg an Ghaeltacht ar thóir na ndeiseanna a thugann na cathracha dóibh, agus bíonn leithscéal ag an Rialtas seo níos lú infheistíochta a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht arís agus arís eile. Is deas an rud freisin go bhfuil an Taoiseach sásta an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus í a úsáid a mhinice agus a dhéanann sé é sin. Ní cóir beag beann a dhéanamh as seo. I ndáiríre, tá sé ina dhíol inspioráide go rachadh Taoiseach na tíre seo i mbun foghlama agus labhartha na Gaeilge, ach gan beart de réir briathair ar pholasaí teanga, is cuma cé mhéad pop-up Gaeltachtaí a fhreastalaíonn an Taoiseach orthu. Feictear domsa go gcaitheann an Rialtas le géarchéim na Gaeltachta agus cruachás na teanga cosúil le géarchéim na haeráide agus cruachás na timpeallachta. Tá go leor rudaí deasa eile gur féidir leo a tvuíteáil agus a roinnt ar líne ach gan aon substaint nó tiomantas ann do chearta bunúsacha teanga agus do chaomhnú na Gaeltachta. Beidh bás an Phiarsaigh ag an teanga má leanann seo ach beidh tvuíteanna deasa ag Fine Gael ar an mbealach ar fad agus bheadh sé sin go deas.

andcalls on the Government to:— provide a range of free, adequate, safe and suitable sanitary products and comprehensive, objective menstrual education information distributed through all public buildings, including schools, universities, direct provision centres, refuges, homeless services, Garda stations, hospitals, maternity hospitals, prisons, detention centres and rehabilitation centres so as to tackle period poverty and de-stigmatise and normalise menstruation;— ensure all menstrual products available in Ireland are safe, through regulation and quality checks;— ensure young women, girls and people of other genders can learn about their periods and menstrual hygiene in a normalising and safe environment, including online by providing a State-run website with objective information, and ensure girls, boys and people of other genders have access to education about menstruation integrated into the school curriculum;— ensure improved access to hygienic facilities and sanitary products that are affordable and meet individual needs;— work with other countries across the European Union to remove VAT on all sanitary products, including healthy and environmentally-friendly sanitary products such as cups and period-proof underwear; and— prioritise the issue of menstrual equity for girls and children’s rights as central to Irish Aid’s work overseas in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, and Goal 6 which calls for universal and equitable access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030.I am sharing time with the Deputy Chairperson of the Oireachtas Women's Parliamentary Caucus, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy. Is onóir í dom an rún seo a mholadh ar son chácas na mban san Oireachtas. Lá stairiúil is ea an lá seo do Dháil Éireann, agus mná ar fud an speictream polaitiúil ag teacht le chéile ar an rún ar bhochtanas míostraithe. Táim bródúil go bhfuil cácas na mban ag obair chun an cheist seo a shoiléiriú tríd an rún seo a mholadh. Agus muid ag obair le chéile agus ag cur polaitíocht na bpáirtithe ar leataobh, táimid ábalta éifeacht dhearfach a bhaint amach do mhná agus cailíní na tíre seo. Níl sa rún seo ach tús le cácas na mban san Oireachtas. Tá sé ar intinn againn níos mó reachtaíochta a chur chun cinn amach anseo chun dul i ngleic le réimse leathan ábhar a bhaineann le mná. Is iomaí agus is coimpléascaí na bacanna ar chomhionnanas a bhaint amach. Le chéile, mar mhná, is fórsa éifeachtach muid chun athruithe dearfacha a bhaint amach. According to research conducted by Plan International Ireland, 50% of women between the ages of 12 and 19 struggle to afford sanitary products. Can one imagine that roughly half of young women in Ireland cannot afford a basic product? This seems like an issue about which we should all be talking if not shouting. It might surprise some Members that up until this moment the word "menstruation" has appeared only 27 times on the Oireachtas records. That record will certainly be broken this evening. Something that affects roughly 50% of the teenage and adult population has been mentioned fewer than 30 times in our national Parliament since the foundation of our State. When one delves into those records, one will quickly find that periods are almost entirely spoken about in a context of fertility rather than in terms of an individual's health and well-being. This is worrying because period poverty is a real issue for women in Ireland. It is having a negative impact on their education, well-being and quality of life. Accordingly, it must be spoken about and addressed in those terms. It is estimated that Irish women and girls spend an average of €132 every year on tampons and sanitary towels. For women, girls and those experiencing periods who are homeless, in direct provision or in full-time education, this is a substantial cost. Many often have to resort to cheap, unsafe products or crude alternatives. The monthly burden of purchasing sanitary products falls on approximately half the population by virtue of their biology. This is both an issue of equality and of dignity. This motion will be a significant move in addressing the issue of period poverty and bringing further attention to this issue, building on a growing movement across Ireland and the world. Last year, on foot of a motion tabled by Councillor Rebecca Moynihan, Dublin City Council announced that it would provide free sanitary products in its buildings. The Homeless Period Ireland organisation, directed brilliantly by Claire Hunt, now has 30 drop-off points for people to donate sanitary products to homeless women. Students across Ireland have been working to address period poverty in their schools. Just yesterday, students from St. Bricin's in Cavan and Eureka secondary school in Meath came to a briefing relating to this motion in Leinster House. They spoke about the work they are doing through their Young Social Innovators projects and the real impact it is having for students in their schools.Across the water, the Scottish Government is taking action to fight period poverty. It has recently become the first Government in the world to pledge to provide free sanitary products to all pupils and students in its schools, colleges and universities. Members of Dáil Éireann need to show leadership on this issue. Our caucus motion this evening is calling for the provision of a range of free sanitary products, including environmentally friendly products in all public buildings, from schools and universities to direct provision centres, refuges, hospitals and prisons as a way to tackle period poverty. Our call does not end at providing free sanitary products. We are also calling for objective menstrual education information to be available in all public buildings. We seek tighter regulation and checks of menstrual products, for Ireland to work at an EU-wide level to remove VAT on products, particularly healthy and environmentally friendly ones, and to prioritise the issue of menstrual equity in Irish Aid’s work overseas. Crucially, we are calling for comprehensive and normalising education on periods in schools and to open up the discussion on periods to everyone. Normalising periods and ensuring objective education is incredibly important. The lack of conversation in the Oireachtas on menstruation mirrors a societal silence on the issue. Six out of ten young women surveyed by Plan International Ireland said that they feel shame and embarrassment about their period; shame and embarrassment about something so ordinary and natural. The stigma surrounding periods and the cost of period products have very real consequences. Plan International Ireland’s survey found that 61% of Irish girls have missed school because of their period. If 61% of students said they had missed school because of some sort of virus it would be a national emergency. No student should have to miss school because of stigma or because she cannot afford sanitary products. Education is a basic human right and we must do everything we can to ensure that right is not jeopardised. We need to remove the taboo around discussing menstruation. No woman should ever feel burdened with unnecessary stress, embarrassment or anxiety every month because of her gender or financial circumstances. We need to be able speak openly about periods so that we can learn about the many and complex issues that people face when on their periods, and address those issues. For instance, have Members ever thought about where sanitary product dispensers are placed? Usually they are found in non-wheelchair accessible women’s bathrooms, positioned at about 5 ft from the ground. This makes them inaccessible to people in wheelchairs, to little people and to trans men. When we shroud issues in stigma, when we fail to have open conversation, we often end up further marginalising whole sections of society. I hope that when this motion passes, these conversations are had and that inclusive accessibility to free products is ensured across the country. We also need to be able to be assured of the safety of the products we use, which is why this motion is calling for better regulation of sanitary products. Last week, Lynn Boylan, MEP, highlighted that the responsibility of ensuring the safety of these products rests with the manufacturers. These are health products so their safety should be ensured through proper State-led regulation. Opening up the conversation on periods, as well as providing free and safe sanitary products, will help to bring greater dignity and well-being to women and girls. When people do not feel able to talk openly about their concerns, we end up with people quietly suffering. I would like to emphasise that it is not just women who need to have this conversation. Of 158 Deputies, only 35 women have been elected to the Dáil and I am disappointed so few men have decided to attend the debate this evening, because this is an issue about which we need to educate our fathers, sons and brothers. While the caucus has ensured that the Dáil has this conversation tonight, and we are grateful that we got Government time for this motion, I cannot emphasise enough that we need more than conversation. It is over to the Government to take the necessary action outlined in our motion to put an end to period poverty. One action it can easily take is to allocate funding in the next budget for the provision of free sanitary products in all public buildings. I am proud of the work the Women’s Caucus has done to shed light on this issue by bringing forward this motion. While the Women’s Caucus enjoys the support of the vast majority of women Members of the Oireachtas, and there have been so many valuable contributions to it by former female Members, I am also aware there are women who are not active members of it, or who chose not to be in it at all, who have co-signed this motion and will speak in support of it tonight. I acknowledge them and thank them for their support which has led to all women Members of the Dáil uniting today on this motion. In doing so, I recognise the fact that democracy in the form of Dáil elections has repeatedly returned women of different viewpoints and different political backgrounds to this House. Often, we disagree more than we agree and that is why today is a glimpse of, and shines a light on, what can be achieved through this dynamic, of women working together, casting aside party political differences, which they genuinely and passionately hold, and exploring options of where we can be a force of positive change and action together. I thank those who helped bring this motion to the Dáil today. Míle buíochas to Sinead Mercier, who drafted the motion with invaluable input from Claire Hunt of Homeless Period Ireland and the team at Plan International Ireland. I thank my own team, Una Power, Donal Swan, Anna Conlan, Catherine O’Keeffe and Linda Wilson, who went above and beyond in their work on this motion. I would also like to acknowledge the Senators from our caucus who have attended tonight’s debate and will be debating this motion in the Seanad on 27 March. I also thank Laura Harmon from the National Women's Council of Ireland, who acts as the secretariat for our caucus. I especially welcome and thank all the visitors in the Gallery this evening, who represent activists, academics and the many organisations and NGOs which do so much to highlight not only this issue but the many issues of inequality and discrimination facing women across the world. I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for his unwavering support of the Women’s Caucus. I take the opportunity as chair of the caucus to state that tonight’s motion is just the beginning for the Oireachtas Women’s Caucus. We intend to bring forward further legislation in the future to tackle effectively a diverse range of women’s issues which need attention. Of course, legislative change is only one facet of the caucus’s work. Since it was established, a mere 18 months ago, we have been making our voices heard on a range of issues. From the forthcoming survey on harassment, bullying and sexual harassment in Leinster House, which the caucus requested and insisted would include every single person who works in Leinster House, to ensuring consultation on the women in the home referendum, to working with female parliamentarians globally by founding and hosting the International Congress of Women’s Parliamentary Caucuses, we are putting women to the front and centre of political decision making. That is where we belong. The barriers to equality, both in Ireland and abroad, are many and complex. Together as women we are an effective force for positive change.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As it stands, the legislation putting rent pressure zones in place will expire at the end of the year. Although the zones have not by any means brought rent affordability to where it should be, they have, at least, had an impact in keeping rents in the areas worst hit by rental increases closer to being under control. However, there has been no definitive indication by the Government as to whether it intends to renew the rent pressure zone legislation at the end of the year or under what set of circumstances it would so do. Many people would face enormous rent hikes if the zones lapsed and they are living with that uncertainty. I would be grateful if the Tánaiste would clarify the intentions of the Government in this area.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This week in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, the local community learned important information about the arrangements for a new school via social media through a tweet with a picture of a letter giving vague information about the securing of a site for a new school due to open in September with no indication of who had written or signed the letter. This was the first that many concerned residents learned about the plans for the school site. Was the Minister for Education and Skills aware that this information was being given out in this manner? If he was, did he send this letter on to certain elected representatives? How did he determine who should be updated on this? It is not the first time this has happened in our constituency. In the past schooling arrangement announcements have been distributed first on social media before even the schools have been told, before parents and children have been told and before the local community has been properly informed. There is an urgent need to overhaul how new schools are announced. Currently they are announced with great fanfare without even the sites secured, which causes serious confusion for the local community. I have raised this with the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and previously with the then Minister, Deputy Bruton.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This drip-feeding of unofficial information on social media is not fair on school communities and is disrespectful to the local community.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Surely there is a better way of engaging.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What is the Government's plan to improve its engagement with the local communities on announcements of schools?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a general issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is cúis áthais dúinn an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála anocht. The Green Party is tabling this motion because the way that we live and travel today is not sustainable for our families, our future, our quality of life or our planet. Recommendation No. 10 of the Citizens' Assembly was that "92% of the Members recommended that the State should prioritise the expansion of public transport spending over new road infrastructure spending at a ratio of no less than 2-to-1 to facilitate the broader availability and uptake of public transport options with attention to rural areas." The need for serious and substantial investment in public transport infrastructure across the country - making public transport a real option for everyone, rural and urban - was recognised by the Citizen's Assembly as necessary to bring down our transport emissions. Emissions from transport make up 20% of our overall greenhouse gas emissions, having risen by 140% between 1990 and 2016. Public transport infrastructure is vital for our planet and there is no time to lose, yet there has been little to no movement by the Government towards investing in it at the scale necessary. The Government's expenditure on roads still greatly exceeds the public transport budget. Project Ireland 2040, the vaunted national development plan, is primarily focused on roads. As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, no public transport projects were completed last year and none will be completed this year and next year. Investing in public transport is about saving the planet, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change. It is about more than that, however; it is about restoring our quality of life. Public transport is an active mode of transport. To get to and from public transport, no matter how short the trip, requires activity. Walking and cycling are the most active modes of transport. As Dr. Lorraine D'Arcy and David O'Connor of the Technological University Dublin stated earlier in the audiovisual room, when it comes to transport the focus most of the time is on commuting and commuting data. We do not seem to consider, as we should in designing our cities, towns and villages, that travel should be for health, social interaction and a variety of purposes in addition to just getting from A to B and then back to A again. Yesterday, research released by motor data company INRIX showed that commuters in Dublin spent a total of 246 hours - ten days and six hours - in their cars in 2018. Only in Bogota and Rome, cities many times the size of Dublin, do commuters spend longer in their cars.It is a cost to our quality of life as time stuck in traffic costs mothers and fathers time with their children and all people time with their families. It isolates and divides and it creates enormous uncertainty and anxiety around travel times for those trying to get to work, school, college, social events, the shops, their places of worship and community. A major investment in public transport infrastructure across the country does not just change how we travel, it changes how we live as a community. Public transport can connect communities. It can connect communities with other communities, and it can create stronger bonds within communities. By allowing public transport as a viable option and taking cars off the road we make our air cleaner, we make walking and cycling safer for our children, we reduce the amount of time people spend stuck in traffic in their cars, and we allow them to spend more time in their communities, getting to know their neighbours. Six out of ten primary school children are driven to school, and the statistics are not much better for second level. According to the CSO, more girls are driving to school than are cycling. It is shocking. No wonder there is a crisis in childhood obesity. More investment in public transport would make them more independent. When we say goodbye to our children in the morning, we can know they have the safe option of travelling to school by bus, train or tram. We should know they have the option to walk or cycle to school if we invest in walking and cycling infrastructure, to make it safe and accessible. For many people in rural Ireland public transport simply is not an option. The infrastructure just is not there. This motion is calling for the Government to invest in rural Ireland and to put that infrastructure in place. The Government must give people the option to take a bus. Why should they have to take the car? They must be given the option of real public transport which brings them where they need to go. We need to guarantee that every village, town or city is entitled to a certain level of public transport infrastructure based on its population size, and everything is linked into the overall public transport network. This is not a fantasy, this is the way public transport operates in countries which take it seriously, like Switzerland. This motion is calling on the Government to be ambitious for our planet and for our communities. Real investment in public transport will make a radical difference to quality of life for many people right across the country and I urge the Government to support the motion before us tonight.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action which is before us. My colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan played a vital role in pressing for the committee to be set up, just as we pushed for climate issues to be included in the work of the Citizens' Assembly. I commend all those who worked on the report - Deputies, Senators, committee staff, researchers, academics, activists and everyone who contributed and presented to create a very important document. It is the beginning of a real roadmap towards a greener, safer and secure future for all of us. The cross-party report is not perfect, but it is an important first step. It is vital that we in this House go further than just noting its contents, as usually happens with committee reports brought before the House. As we all know, noting their contents means condemning them to gather dust on a shelf in the ministerial corridor. That cannot happen with this report. This Dáil has noted too many committee reports without the Government taking step to put their recommendations into force. We cannot afford for this report to be treated in the same way. That is why we have submitted an amendment to have it endorsed by the Dáil. The committee was created as a process for parties and Independents to come together, tease out the issues, have the important discussions and come to a collective conclusion. Compromises were made, as they have to be, when we all commit to working together. Not everything the Green Party sought to have included in the report made it into the final draft. We all have to make compromises because if we did not, nothing would ever be done. In a cross-party process such a this no one gets everything he or she wants. It is vital that we do not fixate on individual issues but instead come together, unite on the issue of our time, namely, saving the planet and creating a sustainable future, to which we say "Yes". We have an opportunity to commit to doing something real and tangible because this issue is too important for us to do anything less. The report is a roadmap for action. Let us endorse it. The financial, social and ecological cost of climate inaction presents too great a risk. We need action now. The scale of the change we must make cannot happen without the political will to make radical, systemic changes in how we structure our world. Individual citizens have a crucial role to play, but it must be a Government-led approach, with the biggest polluters being made to change their ways. Hope is coming from those who will suffer the most from climate change. Young people have been taking to the streets and calling for climate action. Every Friday students have gathered outside Leinster House to protest at the Government's climate inaction. Young people realise they will be the ones most affected by the short-sightedness of the Government today. However, they do not yet have an electoral voice.I have three children, aged 12, ten and eight, who are already looking forward to being able to go to the ballot box because their future, like that of all other children, is at risk. As they watch this debate tonight they, like many other young leaders of this country, will be disappointed that nine of 158 Members saw fit to find time to debate this issue. Where are the Members who profess to care about climate change? I hope that the children and others participating in the climate strike on 24 May will loudly and clearly ask where those Members were when this report, one of the most important to come out of the 32nd Dáil, was debated.  We cannot tackle climate change and continue to explore and drill for oil and gas or continue with a national development plan that prioritises road expenditure over public transport, walking and cycling. As my Green Party colleague in the UK, Caroline Lucas, stated, "we cannot tackle climate change with an economy built on the assumption that precious minerals, fresh air, clean water and rare species can magically regenerate themselves in an instant". In the past 18 months there has been a blizzard, a hurricane and a prolonged summer drought in Ireland. News items in February showed people wearing shorts and queues for 99s. That is not right. It is climate chaos and meltdown. It is a climate emergency. Temperatures are rising, our global and local ecosystems and habitats are being pushed to the limit and our seasons are being knocked utterly out of kilter. This has terrifying implications for our natural heritage, insects and future food security. That is why it is vitally important that this House declares a climate emergency. We call on all Members to support the Green Party's amendment to the motion which proposes to do just that. It is also essential that in declaring a climate emergency we commit to concrete, real and identifiable action rather than just uniting around vague concepts. There is little value in all declaring a climate emergency without committing to doing anything about it, which is why we must endorse the report of the committee. There is no room for complacency, populism or green washing in the greatest challenge facing humanity. Greta Thunberg, the inspiring young climate activist, stated that "Our house is on fire." When one's house is on fire, one does not extinguish part of the fire, one extinguishes all of it and ensures that one is safe. That is why we need to endorse all the recommendations of the report and ensure they are implemented and then go further.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The destruction of species, wildlife, flora, fauna, ecosystems and the natural world is a greater threat to our planet and humanity than any we have faced ever before. Last month, Dáil Éireann declared a national biodiversity crisis. It is up to us, as legislators, to act and to live up to the scale of action needed to tackle the crisis we are facing and it is up to the Government to change tack, take the protection and preservation of our natural world seriously and tackle this biodiversity crisis head on. On 8 May 2019, the National Parks and Wildlife Service released Ireland's sixth national report to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. There is currently no mention of this report on the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht's website. The report shows that we are still failing to halt the loss of our nature. It states that in Ireland, 91% of protected habitats are in poor or inadequate condition and more than 50% are declining. In addition, 14% of species assessed are considered to be endangered. The report states unequivocally that a "transformational change is required" to achieve the vision set out in the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021 that "biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland are conserved and restored, delivering benefits essential for all sectors of society". It continues:Although better conservation designations have been put in place and improved environmental management has been adopted, the mainstreaming of biodiversity has yet to amount to a fully integrated approach. It is unclear if the greater consideration being given to sustainability and biodiversity in sectoral policy is sufficient to turn around the continuing degradation of habitat and species populations, and the threats to key ecosystem services.It is clear from reading this that the Government is simply not doing enough. This is damning stuff from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It is basically saying business as usual is killing off wildlife. Ireland was among 130 members represented at the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, plenary meeting, which took place in Paris recently, and at which the IPBES global assessment was approved. Compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries in the past three years, with inputs from another 310 contributing authors, the report assesses changes over the past five decades, providing a comprehensive picture of the relationship between economic development pathways and their impact on nature. It also offers a range of possible scenarios for the coming decades. Based on the systematic review of approximately 15,000 scientific and government sources, the report also draws, for the first time ever on this scale, on indigenous and local knowledge, and addresses in particular issues relevant to indigenous peoples and local communities. According to the IPBES report, three quarters of the land-based environment and approximately 66% of the marine environment have been significantly altered by human actions. On average, these trends have been less severe or avoided in areas held or managed by indigenous peoples and local communities. In 2015, 33% of marine fish stocks were being harvested at unsustainable levels. Some 60% were maximally sustainably fished, with just 7% harvested at levels lower than what can be sustainably fished. Plastic pollution has increased tenfold since 1980, with between 300 million and 400 million tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes from industrial facilities being dumped annually into the world’s waters. Fertilisers entering coastal ecosystems have produced more than 400 ocean dead zones, totalling more than 245,000 sq. km, a combined area greater than the United Kingdom. The entire natural world is in crisis, yet last year the Government passed the slash and burn Heritage Act, which will have devastating impacts on wildlife on uplands and in hedgerows. The wildlife in our seas is in great danger too. The Irish Wildlife Trust’s 2018 report shows that 48 species indigenous to Irish waters are facing extinction. The Government’s INFOMAR and ObSERVE programmes have found even more of a wealth of species off our coasts. The ObSERVE programme found a dolphin population off Ireland’s coast in winter that is larger than the entire known population of dolphins in the world. Recently, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group tracked a humpback whale from County Kerry feeding near the Porcupine Basin to Cape Verde in north-west Africa. It took the group 16 years to do so. Ireland is a feeding ground for dolphins, blue whales and humpback whales and many more species from all over the globe. We do not know where their breeding grounds are. This information highlights that we know next to nothing about what we are destroying off our coasts. That brings me to the dangers of seismic testing to explore for oil and gas off the Irish coast. To map the seabed for fossil fuel deposits, sonic cannons, also known as seismic airguns, are towed behind boats creating dynamite-like blasts, repeated every ten seconds, 24 hours a day, for weeks and months at a time, at acoustic levels 100,000 times more intense than a jet engine. Seismic airgun testing increased dramatically from 2013 onwards. Noise from a single seismic airgun survey, used to discover oil and gas deposits hundreds of kilometres under the sea floor, can blanket an area of more than 300,000 sq. km, raising background noise levels by 100 times continuously for weeks or months. Seismic airgun surveys are loud enough to penetrate hundreds of kilometres into the ocean floor, even after going through thousands of metres of ocean. Seismic blasts can have damaging effects for up to 4,000 km. There is a wealth of peer reviewed evidence to show that these surveys do damage to wildlife. As highlighted by the Irish documentary, "Ireland’s Deep Atlantic", and the film, "Atlantic", seismic testing blasts are essentially waves of death that cause disorientation and internal bleeding in cetaceans for distances of up to 100 miles. This is why Dingle fishermen find deep sea beings such as giant squid in their nets after rounds of seismic testing in the Porcupine Basin. Oil and gas exploration, apart from its effect on the climate, destroys fundamental aspects of the ocean's fabric. Despite this, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has repeatedly told this House that it will not ban exploration from areas in which these deep sea coral reefs are found or dolphins or blue whales are feeding. The Minister confirmed this again this week when he went back on his previous statements and attempted to stop the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill by calling for a money message before the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage. I ask the Government to draw on indigenous and local knowledge in Ireland. Irish fishermen are reporting drops in fish populations in the Porcupine Basin. They are banned from fishing in the area over months of seismic testing and return to find whiting, cod, tuna and general wildlife populations reduced. The Government is damaging fish populations and wildlife for a privatised, speculative industry that provides no jobs, long-term income for the State or energy security as we do not have oil refineries that would meet demand. Things must change. The Government's business as usual strategy spells disaster not just for human existence but for the future of all life on this planet.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. I commend Deputy Donnelly on tabling this motion, which the Green Party is happy to support. Something I have heard repeatedly from women who have used our maternity services is that they were surprised by their lack of choice in birth plans, from a midwife-led approach to home birthing. The support options simply are not there for most people. This is backed up by research conducted by the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services in 2015 which found that only 5.5% of women had the option of midwife-led care available. We need to ensure that expectant mothers are comfortable and properly cared for. To do this, we need to properly resource our maternity services, especially community-based ones as called for in this motion. We must also look at our maternity services in the context of women's healthcare as a whole. I am pleased that the motion notes the need for women to be listened to and respected. That is key. We have seen women hurt time and time again with regard to healthcare provision in this country, including with the CervicalCheck scandal, the practice of symphysiotomy, damage from vaginal mesh and a long list of other issues. I would hazard a guess that most of us in this Chamber know someone who has endometriosis, a condition that is estimated to affect one in ten women. However, several studies point to a diagnostic delay in treating endometriosis. One reason cited for this is the normalisation of the symptoms and the diminishment of the pain felt. This and the other issues in women's healthcare are symptomatic of a wider problem, wherein women's voices, choices and experiences are all too often overlooked, undervalued or wilfully ignored. It is a harder task but if we want to ensure that women are truly at the centre of maternity care, we need to listen carefully to the experiences of women and enact care guidelines that take women's voices seriously. One thing which is not explicitly outlined in this motion which needs to be addressed is the challenge facing migrant women within our maternity services. According to the second report of the confidential maternal death inquiry, women born outside of Ireland accounted for 39% of all maternal deaths between 2009 and 2012 despite this demographic only accounting for 24% of all women giving birth. We need to ensure that there is true equity of service for all women in maternity care. It is particularly important that this motion calls for timeframes for implementation of funding, resourcing and strategies. A recurring theme across the health service is that consultations are held and strategies are drafted but no timelines are stipulated and no funding streams are identified. We know what staffing we need. We often know what the challenges are. We now need action from Government. This is not particular to maternity care. It is in mental health care, primary healthcare and emergency healthcare, across the board. We do not need more documents on shelves gathering dust. We need resources on the ground.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On behalf of the Green Party, I extend our deepest sympathy to the family, friends and party colleagues of the late Manus Kelly. I noted with interest last week that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was quoted as saying the Government needed to do more consumer protection work to protect people who were living in apartments with building defects and that much more work needed to be done to deal with such defects. I know that the Taoiseach is familiar with this issue. When I raised it previously, he said many homeowners in his constituency, like my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, were facing substantial bills due to defects. Will the comments of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on the defects signal a move by the Government to examine possible supports for the homeowners affected? Two years ago this month, a Green Party motion calling for assistance to be given to homeowners was passed unanimously by the Dáil. A year and a half has passed since the publication of the Safe as Houses report which made a similar call for relief to be provided. Will the Taoiseach tell me whether the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has discussed the issue with him since he made his comments last week?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:To insert the following after “that facilitate gender discrimination towards girls and boys, women and men;”:“— identify and dismantle economic and salary norms that result in gender inequalities, and reassess the economic value placed on work traditionally held by women;”
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In light of the forthcoming introduction of the national childcare scheme, will the Department of Children and Youth Affairs carry out an assessment of the impact of this scheme on lone-parent families? Will the Minister show how the scheme will impact on subsidies for childcare and the hours of childcare available to lone parents?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for her reply but I do not feel it will ease fully the worries of the more than 215,000 single-parent families in this State who are not seeing the benefits of this scheme and who are fearful. There are parents, predominantly women, who feel they are at risk of being forced to forgo work or education because of the potential impacts of the national childcare scheme on existing support schemes for single parents. According to Single Parents Acting For Rights of Kids, SPARK, lone-parent families could face losses of up to €350 per month through the loss of these schemes. The schemes are invaluable in helping lone parents to work or upskill and in helping them to fall into welfare dependency. With the greatest respect, the Department allowing people to stay on their existing schemes until August 2020 if they are not better off is equivalent to admitting that some people may be much worse off as a result of the introduction of the national childcare scheme. That measure is actually elevating fears rather than easing them. I fear that, while the scheme will potentially benefit 95% of parents, it will have a negative impact and possibly awful repercussions on the other 5% and will push them deeper into poverty. Will the Minister outline how the level of subsidies under the scheme will not have a negative impact on such families?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Minister that we should get the word and the proof out to all stakeholders that the level of subsidies under the scheme will not negatively impact on lone-parents' current supports. There must be much clearer two-way communication with single-parent families and with advocacy groups. It must be clear to a mother who is hoping to return to her studies in October that she will still be able to do so under the national childcare scheme. People need to be able to plan their lives and the lives of their families with certainty. I ask the Minister to consider holding a briefing with the persons affected, women's organisations, and Oireachtas Members because we all need clarity on this issue. Families need to know because they need to plan for their future. I have heard that parents are being told subsidies will be based on their own personal circumstances, but it is not clear to them how much they are set to lose once the scheme is up and running. That is where the clarity is really needed. Will the Minister commit to meeting with stakeholders and to giving them concrete answers to their questions?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will be sharing time with Deputy Healy. At the root of climate change is wealth inequality and exploitation of the natural resources of the earth. Fixing the issues that are caused by climate change in their entirety - damage to our environment as well as global inequalities and societal injustices - will require an overhaul of how we do everything, including how we move, eat, live, and care for each other and the planet. Fixing these issues in their entirety will give us the opportunity to create a fairer, more equal, more sustainable society and global economy. I have spoken numerous times on climate change in this Chamber, as have many of the Deputies here. Many times we have called for measures, including radical legislation, which are opposed or blocked by Government. Despite the Government’s indication it will now move to ban single-use plastics in the coming years, welcome though it is, this is only on foot of the European Union requiring it. If we were to be a leader on this issue, the Government would have supported the Waste Reduction Bill when we introduced it two years ago. It would be supporting Deputy Bríd Smith’s Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill, instead of blocking it at every turn. The Government has published an all-of-Government climate action plan. It identified the targets we need to achieve but was not willing to commit to the significant system change required to truly tackle the climate crisis. The Government's approach lacks ambition and it is not showing leadership. It is focused on cost rather than opportunity and we need that opportunity. Things as they stand are broken. They are broken for farmers; they are broken for our biodiversity; they are broken for rural areas; and they are broken for our young people. The verdict in the climate crisis case this afternoon shows the courts were not willing to interfere due to the separation of powers, but there was a clear recognition of the right to a healthy environment. That is why we need to change radically how we do things. We need to have that radical ambition when it comes to climate action. We need to invest in real public transport in all areas, urban and rural. In Switzerland, the canton of Graubünden has a population density somewhere between those of Kerry and Mayo and yet it has hourly bus and rail services that are linked to the national grid. It is all doable if the Government is willing to actually commit to helping rural Ireland move towards a greener future. It cannot do it alone, and right now Government is abandoning it. We need active travel measures, walking and cycling infrastructure. Changing all of our petrol or diesel cars for electric vehicles will not deal with the congestion issues that are gridlocking our cities. In any event, seeking to have 1 million electric vehicles by 2030 is a complete fantasy. The Government is missing the point. We need to give commuters an alternative to the car and our children need to be able to walk and cycle safely to school. We need to have the option of taking a train or a bus and it should be regular. The lack of investment in public transport is the problem. We need to make our homes warmer and the Government needs to really kick start the enormous retrofitting project countrywide and start with our social housing stock. We need to invest in local renewabIes instead of sending all of our money to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for oil, which, as we saw this week, is always going to be volatile in terms of price and supply. Let us make sure we keep that money here, in our communities. Fine Gael has spent eight years trucking along the same route while inequality has just grown and grown. If we want to build a fairer, greener Ireland, we need to overhaul the system. The upcoming budget needs to show a strong intention to change these systems. The Government cannot continue to nudge itself a little bit forward in the right direction, we need to see an intention in the budget that ambitious system change is what Ireland is doing. This will also require a change to the national development plan, which currently is not fit for purpose. It needs a substantial overhaul to focus on other modes of travel. Tomorrow, students and other people throughout the country will go on strike, calling on the Government to take real climate action. This has happened before. The climate strikes in March and May were truly inspirational and it was incredible to stand there with my children, aged 12, 11 and eight, who were screaming outside the gates of Leinster House seeking leadership from the Government to secure their future with all the other youth of Ireland. There are inspirational young people who stand up for climate action every Friday outside Leinster House. The Dundrum Climate Vigil Group comes together every Friday to demand that real climate action be taken by this Government. Striking for climate action is not infuriating, it is liberating. The young people who are standing up for their own future - for themselves - know that the system has to be rebuilt. They are calling on all of us to get behind them so we can do it. I will be there tomorrow with young people from around the country. I encourage all Members of this House to join the youth of Ireland and I encourage the Government to heed the youth. As we begin this new Dáil term, we need to commit to real, radical change, in the full knowledge that that is the only way to secure our future and create an Ireland that is fair and just, and that can be passed down and secured for the next generation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is cúis áthais dúinn í sa Chomhaontas Glas an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála anocht. Climate change is the greatest threat we face and our response to it must be swift and far-reaching. It must also be socially just. There are no jobs on a dead planet, but there are green jobs in a new green economy. This Bill is designed to ensure that workers and communities have a real opportunity to shape our transition away from fossil fuels and ensure that all Government decisions on climate change take workers' employment into consideration and create decent, high value jobs as a function of their implementation. No one can be left behind. Some 1,700 workers are directly employed in the peat extraction industry, while a further 2,500 are employed in support roles. There have already been job losses in the sector in recent years and the Government's response to protecting the futures of these communities has been wholly inadequate. There are similar warning signs in the oil and gas industry and this issue will only become more apparent as time goes by. We know that these industries are unsustainable, so there is no excuse not to act now to provide a safety net for those who work in them. We cannot simply leave these workers behind and create a post fossil fuel rust belt in the midlands. Workers who have lost jobs in fossil fuel industries should be able to redeploy to new sectors and it is incumbent upon the Government to provide retraining and opportunities to facilitate this. Providing for that changeover is at the heart of the Green Party's Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2018. The national just transition commission that this Bill seeks to create provides a range of measures to address this. It will bring together communities, workers, ecological experts and government to provide for dialogue and mediation in finding meaningful solutions for the communities affected by a wind-down in our fossil fuel industry. It will also play a crucial advisory role to the Government and other State agencies in providing them with the expertise they need to maximise the employment opportunities of a low-carbon future. By taking action and planning for a just transition now, we will reap the dividends of a new green economy tomorrow. If we have the vision to grasp the benefits of a decarbonised economy, we stand to benefit from job creation in climate-smart agriculture, in the smart-grid sector and in expanded solar photovoltaic and wind energy. With this Bill, we will have the opportunity to create a fairer economy while protecting our planet. Before I conclude, I would like to express my sincere thanks and míle buíochas to Sinéad Mercier for her Trojan work in drafting this Bill. She has been a tireless advocate for the principles of a Just Transition and this Bill is a testament to her commitment to workers' rights and climate justice. I hope the Members of this House will support our Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2018 and stand with us in defending workers and creating a more equitable green economy in the future.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an An Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo. I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for bringing this motion before the House. It outlines clearly how the State is failing so many students in this country. Many good and inclusive schools across the country welcome all children, regardless of educational need, socio-economic background or the financial situation of their parents. We still have a long way to go, however, to ensure our schools are as inclusive as they should be. DEIS schools teach a much higher proportion of students with special educational needs than non-DEIS schools, and many of them are hugely oversubscribed with students requiring special classes. We still have a long way to go to reach a stage where schools stop cherry-picking students because they are thinking only about the school league tables and not about the child. It is appalling that there is no secondary school with special educational classes in the Dublin 2, 4, 6, 6W or 8 areas. The situation is not much better in my area of Dublin Rathdown. Many parents find it difficult to secure supports for their children in local secondary and primary schools. I received a letter from a parent in Dundrum before the summer. The person concerned stated that he was contacting me about his son who is five years old and has a diagnosis of autism. He stated: He currently attends a special pre-school applied behavioural analysis, ABA, class in Shankill. He has a recommendation in writing for a placement in an autism unit in a mainstream school for 19 September. We have tried many schools in the area and cannot get him a place. Either the unit will not be ready for September or there are no vacancies. We are under huge pressure. If we do not get a place for him, we will have to break up the family. My son and myself will have to move to Laois during the week to access an autism unit while my wife and my teenage child stay in Dublin. As you will understand, this would be a huge problem for us in every way and living away from the rest of the family could cause him more trouble ultimately.This is where things stand. A family is seriously considering separating and renting a house in Laois so that it will be possible to access an autism unit for their child. I spoke to that parent, who was in tears while telling me that they are actually considering emigration to keep the family together. They have endured sleepless nights and have been distraught, anxious and worried. That child will be six in January. He is still in a preschool and the parents feel that if he stays here he will still be in a preschool next year. He will turn seven the following January. It is wrong and shameful. A two-tier system is in place in our schooling for children with special education needs. That has to end. Schools are an essential part of shaping who we are and who we will be. We have an extraordinary duty of care as a State, not just legally and constitutionally but morally, to all children, whoever they are or wherever they are from, to provide them with full and fair education shaped around them and not something that forces them to be shaped around it.  It is awful for people to be made feel they are a burden, that it is a huge amount of hassle for them to be accommodated and that they should have to adapt because they learn in a different way. This is how it feels for many children and their parents and it is not right. The current situation is not fair on those children who are denied a full and fair education because there is no place for them at their local school. It is not fair on their parents, who feel helpless, anxious and abandoned. This is not what our education system should be about. Our education system should welcome diversity. It should be based on inclusivity and be welcoming. For this to happen, the Government needs to properly resource the provision of education for children and students with special educational needs. I call particularly on the Minister for Education and Skills to use his powers under the recent Education (Admission to Schools) Act to ensure schools provide for the children in their areas with reasonable notice periods and the necessary levels of support. In his opening statement, the Minister of State referred to home tuition being available. All Members of the Oireachtas are inundated with emails because this is not the case. I received an email from a home tutor still awaiting a return to work. The email states:I was due to return to work on September 2nd but I am still waiting to receive confirmation from the Department of Education telling me that I can return. Without pointing out the obvious, we are now midway through the third week of September and Primary Schools have long returned for the new school [year] since the end of August.What is happening here? The system is completely broken and needs to be fixed. As for telling parents not to worry because in the meantime they will have access to home tuition, that is not happening. The Minister was copied in on the email.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the report before the House. This report was created following a series of engagements we in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills had on the topic of relationships and sexuality education with stakeholders from a variety of different sectors of the education system - students, teachers, educational institutions and NGOs working in this area and on inclusion issues - over the course of four modules. It was clear from this engagement the change which has been occurring in Ireland's national mindset over the past number of years and which continues to occur in relation to relationships and sex education, and how essential it is that the education system reflect fully, in an informed and responsible way, that change. The current curriculum was introduced in 1999 and a considerable amount of changes across society have occurred since then. While I welcome and endorse all of the recommendations contained in the report, I wish to highlight what was for me the most important theme running through all of the presentations we heard, which was the need for inclusion and inclusivity. Although the national mindset may have shifted greatly over the last number of years, issues of inclusivity have always been present and the horrendous treatment of marginalised groups, such as those from the LGBTQI+ community, in the Ireland of the past must be recognised. In order to include everyone properly, proper respect for human rights, gender equality and diversity is essential in any curriculum. Being cognisant and respecting the great array of diversity in Irish relationships, sexualities and family structures is essential for every student to learn in supporting young people to understand and learn about themselves, as well as to learn about and understand their peers and to develop strong, healthy relationships with others. The recommendations in this report provide a roadmap for developing a modern, fair and respectful relationships and sexuality education programme and I call on the Minister and the State bodies tasked with reform in this area to engage properly and take on board the recommendations. I welcome the NCCA's review of RSE. I welcome much of the engagement made so far under this review, particularly the engagement with students whose views on curricula and teaching methods are too often not valued as importantly as they should be. Indeed, I commend the various student bodies which have had their voice heard throughout this process. I also welcome the finding that teachers need more in-depth and sustained training in the area of SPHE-RSE. It can no longer be that the teacher draws the short straw when the timetable is being drawn up at the end of the school year that he or she is "on". Although the teachers are willing and always ready, they need to be equipped, resourced and trained. That is what is fair on the teacher and that is what is ultimately fair on the student. It is essential in equipping teachers, both in-service for all teachers and providing a specialist postgraduate qualification in SPHE-RSE, to best support students in this aspect of their education. Training should also be provided for boards of management and other bodies within schools. Similarly, supports need to be provided for parents in the area of SPHE and RSE because it cannot be up to the schools alone and parents must have the support and encouragement they need to assist their child in their learning. Engaging all of the various groups — students, teachers, parents and communities — is vital in creating a comprehensive approach to this issue. The report before us acknowledges a need to move to a more nuanced and inclusive curriculum. The topics of relationships and sexuality are complex and students will come to the classroom with varying experiences and needs. Making sure that the programme is fully inclusive of the wide range of diverse human experiences is hugely important, not only in tackling discrimination and othering of non-heterosexual experiences, but also in helping students to understand their own feelings and those of their classmates. The report also presents a realistic understanding of what students require from RSE, which is hugely important in equipping young people for the challenges they face. Issues about sexual consent or the negative impact of pornography are ones that affect everyone and it is high time that we discussed them in an educational space. It is particularly important that consent is taught consistently throughout a student's school experience and in terms of positive sexual relations, delivered in an affirming context where positively framed sexual experiences are the focus. I strongly endorse the call in this report for strong oversight of external facilitators of RSE, either by the Department of Education and Skills or by the HSE. Ensuring that the programme is delivered at a consistent standard, with evidence-based teaching, is important for students. Like previous speakers, I also draw the Minister's attention to recommendations Nos. 14 and 15. The former states: "The Committee recommends that the Education Act 1998 be amended or at least reviewed, so that ethos can no longer be used as a barrier to the effective, objective and factual teaching of the RSE and SPHE curriculum to which every student is entitled." That is why the committee requests that clarity is given by the Department as soon as possible "regarding how schools and colleges, under religious patronage, should implement a comprehensive RSE programme so that all children and young people are treated equally." Throughout our work on this report, it was apparent that the level of RSE varied hugely between schools. No student should have to miss out on a comprehensive RSE simply because of where he or she goes to school. The curriculum must be delivered in a consistent and inclusive manner to all students and from an earlier age.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Bhí mé sásta a léamh inniu go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire an stair a chaomhnú mar ábhar. I welcome his decision to give history special core status as a subject for the junior certificate. I must ask, however, as other Members have, what exactly is special core status? I am sure the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify that. He said in his statement that one of his three ultimate goals is to see every junior cycle student learn about history. What exactly does that mean? Will history be a module that students learn in first and second years but not third year? Will it be protected and given the same number of hours as every other core subject in the junior cycle? I am looking for clarity on that before he gets the full céad míle fáilte from An Comhaontas Glas on his decision. In this decade of commemorations, when we look back on the rich tapestry of our national history, I cannot think of any better time to confirm this subject as a core part of the junior cycle curriculum. This decision by the Minister will give every child the opportunity to learn about our shared past and the richness of human experience. It has been said that history is not only a doorway to the past but also a gateway to the future. Anyone who takes even a cursory look at what is happening now with Brexit on our island and the concerns we have will know the power of our past to influence our present. They will also know how vital a knowledge of our history can be in healing the wounds of the past and allowing the scars to fade. We owe it to our children to ensure they have an understanding of our past. History as a discipline is more than just a study of the past; it equips students with the skills to analyse critically and synthesise information from multiple sources and to develop their own robust opinions from the evidence available. It has never been easier for us to access information; at every moment we have an enormous amount of knowledge at our fingertips.However, every source has a bias and every blog and website is infused with the perspectives and prejudices of the author who created it. History trains students to cast a critical eye on everything they read, to see the perspective from which information is being provided and to weigh it accordingly. This type of epistemology should be considered a basic foundation of the education system and it is why history deserves core status. I commend the Minister on making the decision to protect history, but I seek clarity on exactly what the special core status is. I urge the Minister to re-examine the status of geography in the junior cycle. I understand that before he was elected to the Dáil he was a geography teacher in Donegal, so he does not need me to tell him that geography gives us an understanding not just of the physical, natural world around us but of the myriad people, cultures and ways of life across the globe. Geography is crucial to educating students on climate change, one of the most urgent issues facing us, although I am delighted that students across the world are educating many governments on climate change and urging them to act. History and geography are at the core of our understanding of the world around us and both subjects should be core subjects in the junior cycle.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta an rún seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála anocht. As Deputy Ryan has outlined, the motion before us follows on from the Joint Committee on Climate Action's recommendation that a review of land use should lead to a national land use plan. This recommendation was accepted and endorsed by the Dáil earlier this year. The exploitation of nature and of the earth is at the root of climate change. In pre-neolithic times, forest cover across this island was more than 80%. When this State was founded almost 100 years ago, forest cover on the island was just 1%. While we have made progress in restoring that - we are now at approximately 11% - we have a long way to go. Rather than focusing on the number of trees, we need to make sure the tree cover we have is appropriate to the area. The motion before the House seeks a fundamental shift to a style of forestry that restores nature. This total change will bring more light, more wildlife and greater diversity of life to our woodlands. Our motion calls for a more diverse forestry and a more intense style of forestry management, which will help to create steady jobs in the forestry sector while managing continuous native woodlands. These new jobs will need to be supported by educational infrastructure and funding to support apprenticeship programmes in forest management, alongside the modernisation of equipment available for craft apprenticeship provision. If this fundamental shift in forestry is to work, we need to bring communities and farmers along with us. In the past, some farmers have had negative experiences with forestry. If farmers are to come with us on this journey, we need to pay them properly. We need to ensure they receive steady and sustainable incomes for using their lands in the most sustainable manner. We must help them to diversify and enable them to be the leaders on climate action that they can be, given that they are natural caretakers of the land. It is only then that we can develop the best system of land use for our communities, local economies and natural ecosystems. The current system is not serving our farmers, our wildlife, our island or our planet. We need substantial reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure farmers can be paid for rewilding or planting their land. There are many positive opportunities for local communities and economies in this context. There are employment opportunities for people with an expertise in forestry. Continuous cover forestry is more labour-intensive than clear-fell forestry. This means it can create further employment. When it comes to moving away from a narrow vision of forestry towards a different model, nature is our greatest ally. Self-seeding and rewilding allow nature to do the heavy lifting and to restore itself. This is essential not only for rural areas but also for urban areas. Trees have a role in tackling air pollution in urban areas, increasing quality of life and health and creating streetscapes that keep us closer to nature. This motion is very important for our trees and our wildlife, for protecting the biodiversity of our country and our natural ecosystems and for the quality of life in urban and rural areas. Tackling climate change will require an overhaul of how we do everything, including how we move, how we eat, how we live and how we care for each other and for the planet. By fixing these issues in their entirety, we will have an opportunity to create a fairer, more equal and more sustainable society and global economy. Things as they stand are broken for farmers and for our biodiversity. That is why we need to change radically how we do things. We need to have a radical ambition when it comes to how we use our land. It is time for a different kind of forestry that will lead to a better quality of soil and a better quality of water, is rich in biodiversity, protects our biodiversity and our ecosystems, and puts nature first. It is time to change our relationship with nature to create a better quality of life for all.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Seamus Healy. The Green Party has consistently supported the Fórsa Support our Secretaries campaign which is seeking fair treatment and equality for school secretaries. This is not a dispute which has come out of the blue. Like many other Members, this is not the first time I have raised this issue with the Minister in the Dáil and it was also discussed in detail at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in April. This has gone on long enough. We cannot continue to stand aside and allow hard-working administrators, who are central to the functioning of our education system, to struggle under such unfair working conditions. As a former teacher, I know only too well how crucial, central and critical the role of the school secretary is on a day-to-day basis in running any school and ensuring it functions properly. They are key to everything that happens in school life. The work they do far exceeds the responsibility set out in any job description to which they sign up or in those used by the Public Appointments Service. The problem is that we have an antiquated two-tier system of employment. We have one group made up of secretaries who are under contract with the Department of Education and Skills and enjoy the benefits and protections of public servants. For every one of these secretaries, however, we have heard horror stories involving other secretaries having to draw social welfare payments in order to make ends meet over the summer months, having no access to medical leave or being denied even the moderate pay rises to which they are entitled. A resolution to this dispute is available to the Minister.  I fully support the call by secretaries for a new system of direct employment by the Department of Education and Skills to be implemented. In an education system where teachers and principals, who rely so heavily on school secretaries, are directly paid by the Department, I see no sense in school secretaries being the exception, especially when we see the inequity this separate status can cause. Like teachers, school secretaries do substantially similar work regardless of where they are based. They are also expected to work with departmental administrative systems regardless of whether they are employed by the Department. It makes no sense for some secretaries to be working under such unfair conditions in comparison with their colleagues. A single-tier system, provided by the Department, is needed to address this.  The price of inaction will be an entirely justified escalation of industrial action on the part of secretaries, which will ultimately impact on the functioning of our schools and learning outcomes for our students. I urge the Minister to intervene now to prevent this unnecessary disruption and secure the rights of workers who have been pushed to the margins for far too long. Fórsa has requested that the Department utilise the services of the WRC in an effort to resolve this dispute through meaningful talks. Let those talks begin as soon as possible. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome this decision he will enter talks. I hope they will be meaningful. It is a shame that it took industrial action to prompt this response. The issue of equal pay for equal work for our secretaries, caretakers and teachers in the full education system needs to be tackled. We must start with the secretaries and move on to the teachers for equal pay for equal work. There must be meaningful talks and an end to the two-tier system of pay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government has made a lot of noise about how this budget is about two things, namely, Brexit and climate. Let me say right here and now very clearly, this budget is not a climate budget. It is nowhere near a climate budget. It is a further tinkering around the edges when it comes to climate action, instead of the wholesale changes we so desperately need in every area of Government policy. The Government is so concerned with the €90 million it intends to raise through increasing the price of carbon, that it honestly seems to think that is all the climate action it needs. The Government honestly seems to think that €90 million and a cycleway here or there is all that is needed to tackle the climate crisis, out of a budget of €70 billion. Frankly, it is embarrassing. Carbon pricing is an essential part of what we must do if we are serious about curbing emissions but it must be done in a fair way. It would be much more progressive and fair to raise the carbon price as the Green Party proposed and as was recommended by the ESRI, by returning every cent raised back to the pockets of every person across the country. That would have been a much fairer way than the approach the Government has taken, and would have ensured that we begin on a road to curbing our carbon emissions, while protecting many of those who would be most affected. The Government has provided €1.2 billion for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, with further moneys, as required. Where is the similar scale of urgency for the climate emergency? Where is the similar level of urgency for the biodiversity emergency? Where is the similar level of urgency for climate justice, for reshaping our economic model to value social and caring work, to reduce income and wealth inequality as we move towards a more sustainable, less wasteful, more caring economy? The Minister was right in one thing yesterday; there were no surprises in this budget. Given Fine Gael's record over the past eight years in government on climate, we did not expect much. We dared to hope, but with its record we knew it was a slim hope. The Minister made good on his promise. There were no surprises. I will give him that. In the entire budget there was not one truly ambitious move on climate. Just as expected, there were no surprises there. There was no change of direction in housing, no indication the Government is moving away from its private market-based approach that has not been working. There were no surprises there. There was no scale of ambition in transport, education, health, social protection or any Department at all. No surprises means no ambition. It was a status quo budget from a status quo Government. We do welcome some individual measures, such as the increase in the qualified child allowance. That is something we sought, albeit on a greater scale. We also welcome the increase for lone parents. It is something, but it is far from where it needs to be. However, on climate, there was so little. The just transition commissioner is welcome. For that reason, it is all the more surprising that Fine Gael had little or no interest in our comprehensive just transition legislation, which was before the House only a few weeks ago. The Minister indicated that it would meet a death through the dreaded money message. There is so little for protecting biodiversity. A total of €5 million was allocated to peatland restoration. If the Government was serious about climate, it would be ten times that amount. A total of 2% of the spend on transport was allocated to cycling. It is astounding that we are still only at 2% for cycling. We should be making it easy for children to cycle and walk to school and for people to feel safe to take that alternative, but only 2% was allocated to cycling. The same goes for the lack of ambition in afforestation and retrofitting. Meagre steps in the right direction will not cut it any more. While it might be a Brexit budget, or rather a take-cover-under-Brexit budget, there is no certainty for people and SMEs in the measures provided. There is no clarity. It is deeply disingenuous and insulting to all of the students and schoolchildren who have campaigned and gone on strike for climate, to call it a climate budget. Likewise, for all those taking part in the Extinction Rebellion protests, and most importantly, for the future generations of people in Ireland and around the world who will have to deal with the fallout of the State's inaction on climate on days like today. Not alone is there no ambition to deal with climate change in the budget, there is no ambition in the budget for education. While the new allocations for special educational needs are to be welcomed, there is not enough in this budget to view education as a priority, to provide for the future and to invest in children. Schools are struggling because of capitation funding cuts and are losing teachers to pay inequality. Parents are struggling under the weight of back-to-school costs. Once again, the Government has neglected the ongoing crisis in third-level education funding. Universities are in crisis, while students across the country are grappling with the second-highest fees in Europe, a skyrocketing cost of living, housing issues and lack of transport. There is nothing in the budget to help students to break down the barriers. There is no real increase in funding for higher education, and no extra supports for students. The opportunity to use the human capital initiative for green skills development is also a missed opportunity. Educating young people for the new green economy is an essential step and it was missed in the budget. That leads on to the fact that there is no real ambition in this budget on housing. Once again, the failure to adequately engage in the provision of affordable housing options and to stem the tide of families being made homeless is brutally apparent.There has been no change of tack and no change of course, while there is no security for renters. It is just a continuation of a plan that evidently is not working and has not been working for years. The Government continues to rely on the private market to deliver homes for sale and rental without tackling the issue head-on. It is not providing the level of funding needed to build social and affordable housing. It is also failing to invest in the cost rental model on the scale proposed by the Green Party that would truly protect renters. Continuing the help-to-buy scheme without addressing the underlying problems of affordability and supply is going to keep young people shackled to mortgages for unaffordable homes. As a result, they will be at risk of interest rate increases and subsequently paying large amounts of their income in mortgage repayments.  There is no ambition for health services in the budget, certainly no ambition for mental health services. Students and young people are suffering intensely from the lack of provision of adequate mental health supports. At a time when young people are under more pressure than ever because of high fees and soaring rents, most are having extreme difficulty in accessing counselling and psychotherapy services on campus. Outpatient waiting times for CAMHS are shocking, especially when one thinks of the urgent need of young people in crisis. Only 68 more staff are in the mental health support services of the HSE today than in 2009. More than 2,500 children are waiting for mental health services, while more than 8,000 people are waiting for primary care psychology services. However, we let them wait. The Government continues to let them wait in agony. It is not only the people directly concerned who are suffering with mental health problems but also their families. They have to watch them suffer without being able to help. Shame on the Government. However, this comes as no surprise after eight years of Fine Gael in government. This is a meek, ineffectual budget delivered just when Irish people are taking to the streets and raising their voices to seek change. We need change and action, but this budget will not bring them about.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government regarding student accommodation. Yesterday, I received a reply to a parliamentary question I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government regarding properties availing of tax relief under section 50 of the Finance Act 1999 to provide student accommodation. I asked the Minister how many of the properties which have reached the end of the ten-year stipulation included in the Act have now been converted from student accommodation to private rental accommodation. Although I submitted this question to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I received a reply from the Minister for Finance but it does not answer my question. Therefore, I am seeking some clarity on this issue. While I appreciate tax returns will not show the conversion of student accommodation to private rental accommodation once the tax relief has ended, this is an issue the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government should not only be aware of but he should be actively seeking this information as it relates directly to the supply of student accommodation across the country.Given the crisis in affordability and supply of student accommodation, does the Minister have any information regarding the number of properties in respect of which this relief has been sought after they have been converted and, if not, does he intend to seek this information?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister has not answered my question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is Ireland in 2019; this is direct provision. Direct provision is parents sharing bedrooms with their children, it is kitchens running out of food and it is hotel signs stating, “Use the back stairs and do not enter public areas." This is Ireland; this is 2019. To say direct provision is appalling, or to say that it is a disgraceful way to treat human beings, does not adequately capture what this system is doing. It is so much worse than that. It is stories of real people and their experiences, not statistics. Direct provision is hotels shipping people off to another location for a weekend so they can make more money by hosting a wedding. It is mothers and daughters walking five miles on a dangerous road into town to purchase essential sanitary products. It is gay men being forced to share a bedroom with homophobic males. There are families in direct provision limbo, some for over eight years, with children who were so young when they arrived in Ireland that they do not remember life outside direct provision. Eight years is an entire childhood. This is 2019. This is direct provision in Ireland. This system is a clear example of Government "anti-policy" at its worst. What do I mean by that? I mean it is a system that exists because of a failure to make any decision to do otherwise. Direct provision was always meant to be a "temporary measure", a hasty response to an issue that demanded a far better and comprehensive solution. There is nothing temporary about what direct provision has become - in essence, a lengthy period of detention for people who have committed no crime, who have no greater desire other than to live safely without violence and persecution. Just as we look back in horror at some of the institutional abuse the Irish State perpetrated in the past against some of our most vulnerable, we will, I firmly believe, look back 30 years from now and hang our heads in shame at how we sentenced vulnerable men, women and children fleeing unimaginable situations to what one asylum seeker described as "worse than prison”, adding that “at least in prison you have your release date." Dr. Margaret Wheatley, at a recent talk in UCD, summed it up when she said all that people want is to earn, learn and belong. Limiting asylum seekers' opportunities to work takes away their dignity. Their access to education is sporadic and limited, and life on €38.80 per week in remote rural areas prevents any chance of belonging or getting to know the local community. This is not the Ireland I know. There is no céad míle fáilte in direct provision.I find it unbelievable that we, as a country, which is so familiar with the concept of leaving these shores to find a better life across the world, have let this happen. Asylum seekers are invisible and excluded from society. The process of separation and exclusion leads to othering of these people and creates a "them" and "us". We, as a country, are warehousing people: asylum seekers who have survived torture, sexual violence, inhumane and degrading treatment, who came to our country seeking refuge. They have been stripped of any right to privacy, private family life and the right to unrestricted work. Where are the psychological supports for the survivors of torture or sexual violence? Where are the suitably qualified translators they so badly need? Where is the access to legal representation to help them navigate through the exhausting, harrowing process of seeking asylum, and why does the process take so long? People living in direct provision should be supported to access the community in order to form social and economic ties. We must support communities that host asylum seekers and we must create opportunities for asylum seekers to socialise and make connections with the local community. That will tackle racism and fear of the unknown that is present among some communities in Ireland and will prevent a language of hate taking hold. We must support the direct provision centres themselves, through ensuring they have adequate education and childcare facilities, healthcare, shops and amenities. We must make transport more accessible. The often long distance between direct provision centres and towns and cities means that transport costs can be a significant barrier to accessing the local community and engaging with local people and employment and education opportunities. Transport services to and from direct provision centres should be cheaper and more frequent. Given that asylum seekers only receive €38.80 a week, they should be entitled to free public transport. Free and regular English classes should be provided in direct provision centres to facilitate integration in the community, and as a means to address the isolation and marginalisation perceived by many who seek asylum. The EU directive on reception conditions for asylum seekers refers to the need to provide an adequate standard of living, but asylum seekers are being crammed into bedrooms in order to maximise profit for the private owners or landlords, as they are paid per head rather than on adequate space per person. Where are the inspections of premises to ensure safe, clean, warm, living conditions? Surely the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should have a role in this regard. Access to education is limited in direct provision. Schools are not free in Ireland. There are costs relating to transport, books, uniforms, or any other number of fees and charges that parents of school-goers have to face on an ongoing basis. How can parents afford to send their children to school when they are denied the right to a steady job? The lack of ability to work and study results in asylum seekers becoming deskilled, bored, depressed, and when mental health issues develop there is little or no access to mental health supports. Permission to work must be extended, and made less restrictive, as that would allow people to leave direct provision centres. We have a duty to process applications for asylum in a timely manner. No one should be waiting even a fraction of the time it takes but many asylum seekers live in direct provision for years and years. That is wrong, and it must end. We should never tolerate or defend the use of inflammatory, divisive or dangerous language from any Member of our national Parliament inside or outside this Chamber. I am reminded of a poem that is mounted on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in New York that is often quoted by those who recognise the value of compassion and empathy for those who live in more fortunate countries when we think of our obligations to those fleeing from disaster:Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.We do not just need direct provision to end, we need to overhaul the entire asylum-seeker process and to bring dignity, respect, safety, empathy and kindness into how we treat those who come here to this country, fleeing from persecution and terror, and to treat them with the very basic decency to which every person should be entitled.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas sásta tacaíocht aa thabhairt don rún seo. We have no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. We have no confidence in him as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. We have no confidence in this Government's ability to tackle this housing and homelessness crisis. It has shown time and again that its solutions are not working and that it has no willingness to change. This motion is not just about a lack of confidence in the Minister. We had no confidence in his predecessor, or any of the Ministers with responsibility for housing who have been in office since Fine Gael entered government. Since 2014, Fine Gael has worn a set of ideological blinkers that prevented the party from recognising that our housing crisis is a result of market failures. It is clear that market solutions will not solve this problem. The obsession with market solutions is an article of faith among the Minister and his colleagues. No amount of suffering and no number of families spending Christmas in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation seem able to convince the Government that its fundamental approach to this issue is flawed. It seems to me that to call our current situation a housing "crisis" is an insult to those who have suffered and who continue to suffer under it. A crisis is something that occurs suddenly and demands immediate action. We have been told by Fine Gael every year since 2014 that houses cannot be built overnight and that its solution is just around the corner. I believe that the term housing "disaster" might be more apt than housing "crisis". The Minister and his colleagues stand for continuing to tolerate this disgrace, this status quo. We need change. The Minister released the latest homelessness figures for the month of October mere hours before this debate tonight. The figures were not released at the end of the month, which was last week. Instead they conveniently arrived with a very limited timeframe for Opposition Deputies to study them before tonight's debate. We have, however, had a look at them and they are not easy reading. There are now 10,514 people in homeless emergency accommodation across the State. There was an increase of 117 people homeless in a single month this year. When homelessness figures are going up, week after week, month after month, and year after year it is a sign that something is not working. Nothing is working in the Minister's housing policy. It is not as though the Opposition has been quiet with our alternative approaches. There is hardly a Deputy on this side of the House who has not put forward a constructive, practical, alternative solution to the housing and homelessness crisis and yet, almost without exception, these solutions have been ignored, dismissed and at times ridiculed by the Government. This Dáil passed a Green Party motion calling for the provision of cost rental public housing at scale on public land. In our pre-budget submission this year we provided for a huge investment in this sustainable form of housing, which will ensure a range of diverse tenants in stable, secure rental accommodation for decades. We provided for the same proposals last year but the Government ignored it. The Government is simply unwilling to build public housing on public land in the numbers needed to tackle this housing crisis. More than three years ago we introduced into this House legislative amendments on a cross-party basis with a number of Opposition parties for rental security for tenants. The previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, opposed it then and his successor has opposed these rights every time since, because it would decrease the property values of landlords. People are without homes. Agus muid ag smaoineamh ar choinneal a lasadh san fhuinneog ar Oíche Nollag na bliana 2019, is scannalach an rud é go bhfuil beagnach 4,000 páiste ag fanacht in óstáin. This is 3,826 children, mar mháthair agus mar Theachta Dála, táim an-bhuartha faoi thodhchaí agus faoi mheabhair shláinte na bpáistí seo. This is a result of Fine Gael's housing policy. It is a result of Rebuilding Ireland. It is a result of favouring the powers of landlords to evict tenants for almost any reason over the rights of tenants to safe, secure and warm homes. It is a result of endorsing and transcribing every wish of the construction industry instead of listening to the horror and anguish of those families who are without a home as we stand here tonight, and who will be without a home this Christmas. Níl aon muinín againn as an Aire.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 4:To delete all words after “declares that:” and insert the following:“— Ireland needs to adopt fundamental changes in our economic model by moving towards a circular economy;— the shift to a circular economy requires both changes in economic incentives and stronger environmental regulation, to prevent harm and to hold accountable those who cause environmental harm;— the best model for Ireland to emulate is a north European social democratic market economy, such as exists in Denmark, Finland, Sweden or the Netherlands;— environmental action should be taken alongside measures to improve economic vitality and promote social progress; and— the best way to achieve these aims simultaneously is by striving to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; and calls on the Government to:— develop a National Land Use Plan with a view to protecting biodiversity, reducing carbon emissions, improving air, water and soil quality and enhancing our quality of life;— redraft the National Development Plan to align it with the National Planning Framework so that urban sprawl and high-emission, long-distance commuting is limited;— take the role of an international leader rather than laggard in climate action and to drive the implementation of the European Green Deal;— recognise that under-regulation of economic activity or lax enforcement of existing rules allows greater levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to occur;— legislate to reinforce the polluter pays principle, including a requirement for greenhouse gas emissions to be included as a core component of company accounts in enterprises with 50 or more employees and all enterprises in highly polluting industries;— immediately enact a nationwide ban on smoky coal, which has already been proven to work in many larger urban areas without legal challenge;— produce a National Clean Air Strategy;— produce a National Clean Water Strategy;— urgently present and implement a plan to regulate all quarries and to eliminate illegal dumps; and— provide a quantified account of how the measures in the Government’s Climate Action Plan 2019 will reduce Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions to reach the target of 33 million tonnes by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.”I ask your leave, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to change the Green Party amendment in order that it does not delete any part of the motion, but merely inserts the contents of our amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim comhghairdeas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus guím gach rath air sa chúram tábhachtach a bheidh air sa Dáil seo. Tacaím le hainmniú an Teachta Eamon Ryan mar an chéad Taoiseach ón gComhaontú Glas. Is léir dúinn uile gur tharlaigh athrú mór stairiúil sa toghchán coicís ó shin. Tá an Teachta Eamon Ryan á ainmniú againn mar Thaoiseach toisc go n-aithníonn muid an sainordú atá faighte ag an gComhaontas Glas ón bpobal chun tacú le gníomhú ar son na haeráide i nDáil Éireann. Bhí dhá rabharta ghlas ann le déanaí, agus is léir gur mó a thuigeann an pobal anois gur baol dúinn an t-athrú aeráide. Éilíonn daoine óga orainn go háirithe saol slán amach anseo a chinntiú dóibh go náisiúnta agus go domhanda. Caithfear aithint go bhfuil éigeandáil aeráide ann, chomh maith le héigeandáil tithíochta agus éigeandáil sa chóras sláinte. Fógraíodh géarchéim aeráide sa Teach seo roinnt míonna ó shin, ach caithfear beart a dhéanamh de réir briathair anois. Ar an gcaoi chéanna, caithfear aird a dhíriú ar an ngéarchéim teanga sa Ghaeltacht chomh maith. Theastaigh uaim é sin a dhéanamh inniu tríd an óráid seo a thabhairt i nGaeilge, chun beart a dhéanamh de réir briathair. Tacóidh an Comhaontas Glas go mór le neartú Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla le linn an téarma Dála seo. Déanfaimid an gníomhú ar son na haeráide a luaigh mé chun an t-athrú ó bhun a bhfuil géarghá leis a bhaint amach, ionas go mbeidh an tír seo chun tosaigh seachas í a bheith ag titim ar chúl sa chúram sin, agus mar fhreagra ar na mílte duine a thug na sráideanna orthu féin chun an gníomhú sin a éilimh. Chuala muid iad, agus táimid ag seasamh leo. De réir sin, is cúis áthais dom an Teachta Eamon Ryan a ainmniú mar Thaoiseach.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The past few weeks have been like nothing any of us has ever seen. Yet, in the face of crisis this country has shown the good grace for which we are known through an incredible example of unity, sacrifice, kindness, compassion, discipline and good humour. Thank you has been said many times in this House and by many across the country but it bears repeating to the front-line staff across the island who are working heroically to keep us safe. These are the front-line healthcare workers who deal with the dangers of Covid-19 daily, the retail workers and all those who ensure that the chain of food and vital services is kept open, our Garda and our firefighters. Our thoughts are with all those who have died and with their families, friends and communities who have been deprived of being able to mourn properly the tragedy of their passing. In the same way the country has come together, we in Dáil Éireann have co-operated and worked together to an unprecedented level to enact emergency legislation. It is a shame, however, that this unity of focus and purpose did not go further at this time through forming an inclusive, national Government, not just to play the vital role of managing the daunting and prolonged crisis by bringing as many people as possible on that journey, but by also ensuring that people of all walks of life, as many as possible, buy into and play a constructive role in the incredibly difficult Covid-19 recovery phase that lies ahead. It is regretful that some continue to practise exclusion and selectivity in politics, even at this time when we all need to come together.It may yet prove that the idea of a unity government is only temporarily parked rather than permanently shelved and may re-emerge for consideration. That may become more apparent in the near future if other options, after being exhausted, do not produce white smoke. This has been a particularly trying time for all of those in the education sector, including students, teachers, parents and all staff who work in our educational institutions. I have a number of questions. I will ask all of them, and if the Minister does not have enough time to answer, perhaps he will furnish me with a written reply if he has time. One of the primary issues facing the sector relates to the postponement of the leaving certificate. The unprecedented situation in which we find ourselves is already having an immense impact on students' mental health. On 10 April it was announced that exams would be postponed until later in the summer. Very little was clear and this announcement left students with more questions than answers and added further to their stress and confusion about the situation. On Tuesday evening this week I, like thousands of others, found out through social media that the Minister had announced the provisional date of 29 July during an informal questions and answers Instagram video. This casual delivery of vital and important information is simply unacceptable and shows a lack of regard for students and their welfare at this time. Many students were calling for a predicted grades system as an alternative to the leaving certificate exam. Has the Minister investigated the possibility of this alternative? Does he have a contingency plan prepared and ready to go if the crisis continues in such a way that it is impossible to hold the exams in July and August? When will we get sight of that plan? What extra provisions will be put in place to ensure that the mental well-being of students will be supported as they continue through their extended school year? At third level, our students are facing a wide variety of issues but housing and academic uncertainty around assessment are two of the most pressing. The Minister indicated to me in a Covid query response last week that he would like to see private providers of student accommodation provide pro rata refunds. This issue has arisen for many students not just in respect of refunds but also the retention of deposits by landlords. Has the Minister taken any concrete steps to tackle this issue or prepared any real measures to do so? While six of our seven universities are offering pro rata refunds to students who have to vacate their accommodation, it is my understanding that the University of Limerick is still refusing to do so. The Department has been engaging with the university with regard to this issue. Will the Minister outline what progress has been made? When it comes to deferrals or alternative arrangements for assessment, it is not just about timing and delay. The issue of support for students is also involved. Many students' ability to support themselves through higher and further education is dependent on the availability of work during the summer. Such work is unlikely to be available to many this year. It is also dependent on SUSI supports, which are based on income levels from 2019 which does not take into account the enormous changes in circumstances faced by many students and their families in 2020. What measures is the Minister putting in place to protect not just students' academic futures but their ability to support themselves for the next academic year? Will there be any alternative assessment of financial circumstances given the current context? Cad iad na hacmhainní a bheidh ar fáil do dhaltaí le Gaeilge mar chéad teanga - daltaí Gaeltachta agus daltaí na nGaelscoileanna uile sa tír? Molaim an obair atá á dhéanamh ag TG4 chun freastal ar na páistí seo ach cad a dhéanfaidh Roinn an Aire chun a leasa? Cén cúiteamh a bheidh ar fáil do phobail Ghaeltachta agus cúrsaí samhraidh na gcoláistí ar ceal? Braitheann na Gaeltachtaí go mór ar na daltaí agus múinteoirí a thagann gach bliain. Nílim ag tagairt do na coláistí agus na mná tí amháin ach do na gnóthaí timpeall orthu. Tá níos lú airgid ag dul go dtí Gaeltachtaí na tíre ná aon áit eile. Gan cúnamh ón Rialtas, beidh na pobail seo agus an teanga Ghaeilge thíos go mór leis an ngéarchéim seo.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This has been an extremely difficult time for children of all ages. Many primary school students across the country are missing out on their final months at school, missing rites of passage such as the final sports day in primary school, where those students are finally the senior members of the school and leading the school teams. They are missing out on taking the last school tour together as a sixth class group, something to which they all look forward. They are also missing out on an official graduation ceremony with their school communities and families and are being deprived of the basics of saying goodbye to the classmates, beside whom they have sat for eight years, before they move on to their various secondary schools. It is truly a distressing time for those students. Is am an-chorrach é seo do pháistí scoile de gach aois. Many children find themselves in the bizarre situation of looking forward to putting on their uniforms again and going back to school. They never imagined that would happen. Usually in May, students look forward to casting their uniforms aside for three months but are now looking forward to putting them on again. They also look forward to the days when they can have birthday parties and play dates with friends in real life, not through Zoom or WhatsApp, and that is if they have the broadband to use those applications. The past few months will, no doubt, have lasting and traumatising impacts on many young people. It is important that they are supported and protected as we move forward from this crisis. It has been an unbelievably stressful time for leaving certificate students. There has been much uncertainty and a lack of clarity in recent months which has caused unnecessary confusion and stress. While many students were relieved last week when the Minister announced the cancellation of the examinations, others were disappointed and worried that the calculated grade system would not result in a fair reflection of all the work they have done this year and in previous years. I am deeply concerned that the proposed school standardisation alignment process that will use a school's past exam results to alter the results of current leaving certificate students will adversely affect students in disadvantaged schools who would otherwise have done well. There is now a perceived risk of such a student receiving a lower grade due to his or her school's previous results. How will the Minister ensure that this system is fair and recognises one of the most positive aspects of leaving certificate examinations, that is, that any student can excel no matter what school he or she attends? I doubt that the Minister would suggest that a student's score should be altered based on geography or socioeconomic background. However, with this system, what will effectively happen will be an almost stereotyping and pigeon-holing of schools in order to adhere to the results of previous years.  Has a decision been made about how far the data set used in these alignments will go back? How will the Minister offer a rock solid guarantee that the grading process will be carried out in a fair manner that does not inadvertently lead to further disadvantage for these students? Objectivity is another essential component of the calculated grade system. What steps have been taken to ensure that teachers and school principals are protected against being lobbied by parents and students as they work through this process?It is also incredibly important that in this new exam process, students who do not fit into the standard mould of the leaving certificate are not forgotten about or excluded. How much consideration was given to home schoolers and students who have taught themselves subjects and, therefore, do not have teachers to give them a grade? In the case of repeat students who only have this year's in-class results to use as reference, will their previous leaving certificate results be taken into account? Was any consideration given to the leaving certificate applied exams going ahead? Given the way those students' courses and assessment are set up, they were only due to sit a small number of exams at the end of sixth year. Furthermore, how does the Minister intend to guarantee that all grading and appeal processes will be completed ahead of the UCAS and EUNiCAS August deadline for students applying to universities abroad? In his announcement last week, he stated that the original date of 29 July for the leaving certificate exams was now considered to be an unsafe return time based on updated information. If 29 July is not suitable for students to return to school, how will it be safe enough for schools to open just one month later in September? In fact, some secondary schools opened as early as 18 August last year. What consideration has been given to how students will safely return to school as currently planned, with schools to operate as normal? How can schools plan for the 2020-21 academic year given such uncertainty? How can they do their timetables and plan their induction days, training days, recruitment processes and interviews? Schools were only at the stage when the lockdown happened where retirements and career breaks had been flagged with principals. Surely those interviews have not even been held. How is it now proposed that they will be held? How will we have enough staff in our schools when they return? I have received correspondence from parents of children with special needs expressing their concern over the lack of information being shared regarding their children's return to school and the loss of the July provision. It must remain a priority to get these children back in school as quickly as possible. What consideration has been given to the families in question and is there a roadmap in place for children with special needs to return to school? In addition, it is vital that we do not forget the invaluable work of our special needs assistants, SNAs. What engagement has the Minister had with them and how has he continued to keep them informed of where and how they fit into the Department's ever-changing plans? I would be grateful if he might raise a matter with the Minister for Health. Regarding the human papillomavirus, HPV, school vaccine programme, many first year students across the country received their first dose of that vaccine last September and were due to receive the second dose from February onwards. What are the plans for schools whose students did not receive their second vaccine dose before the lockdown and has there been any communication with principals, teachers or parents on this matter? As it stands, my understanding is that parents are not allowed to take their child to a GP to receive the vaccine if the child is in the school programme. What are the implications for students who missed their second dose? The impacts of the changes made in our education system in the next few months will echo for years to come. It is vitally important for all students, parents, teachers, educators and entire school communities that they receive clear, comprehensive and detailed information about these changes as quickly, effectively and fully as possible.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move the following Revised Estimate:
Vote 33 - Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Revised)
That a sum not exceeding €376,236,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2020, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and grants and that a sum not exceeding €3,435,000 be granted by way of the application for capital supply services of unspent appropriations, the surrender of which may be deferred under Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004.Is mór agam an deis seo a fháil inniu chun Meastacháin na Roinne Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta do 2020 a phlé. Tá an-áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam labhairt faoi leithdháiltí agus tosaíochtaí na Roinne Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta do 2020. Is eol do na Teachtaí gur le na meáin, turasóireacht, ealaíona, cultúr, spórt agus an Ghaeltacht a bhaineann mo cheapachán. Tá réimsí cláir an-leathan agus an-éagsúil i gceist leis sin agus táim ag tnúth go mór le dul ina mbun agus iad a chur ar aghaidh le linn mo thréimhse mar Aire. Today's appearance relates specifically to the 2020 Revised Estimates for the previous Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I will therefore confine my remarks to those programme areas and ask that Deputies likewise confine any questions or clarifications they require to these areas. It should be noted that, in the newly created Department, my responsibilities will no longer include the heritage division, which will transfer to the new Department responsible for housing, local government and heritage where they will be the responsibility of my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. In addition, in the newly created Department my responsibilities will no longer include the islands, responsibility for which will transfer to the new Department responsible for social protection, community and rural development and the islands under my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. Déanfaidh an tAire Stáit, Teachta Calleary, agus mise araon tráchtanna gairide ar réimsí cláir aonair anois. Táimid sásta tuilleadh sonraí a thabhairt faoi aon ní ba mhaith leis na Comhaltaí a tharraingt anuas. Over the past few months, we have all been witness to the devastating and unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across all sectors of society and the economy. The arts and culture, heritage, language and islands sectors have suffered considerably in view of the audience-facing focus of much of their work. They will continue to experience difficult and challenging times long after many other sectors have returned to work. These sectors are an integral part of the fabric of society, particularly in rural areas where they support tourism, economic activity, and well-being. They represent a very important component of regional development. Myriad community, voluntary and not-for-profit entities typify these sectors and there is a very significant ecosystem of local and small enterprises, economic activity and regional employment dependent on these sectors. It is therefore imperative that we support these sectors through their vulnerability in the face of the Covid pandemic. There has been extensive consultation with cultural bodies, the Arts Council, arts organisations and individual artists and arts practices since the commencement of the Covid-19 crisis. This engagement has made us all very aware of the challenges that artists have faced and also of the hugely important role that they have played in sustaining all of us in recent months. The recent announcement of a further investment of €25 million in arts and culture during 2020 reflects the significant role arts and culture play in our individual lives and across society as a whole. Many challenges lie ahead as we begin to exit from Covid-19 restrictions but there is a determination to ensure that we have a vibrant arts and culture sector to see us through these challenges and into the future. Among the measures that will be introduced on foot of the additional funding will be new bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. The Department will provide supports for cultural centres, including local and regional museums, as well as for new online cultural and creative content to build on the success of programmes such as Ireland Performs, the "Other Voices: Courage" programme and Cruinniú na nÓg. The funding will ensure that the important role culture plays in contributing to our well-being at all times, and particularly in times of crisis, can be safeguarded and enhanced. When account is taken of this additional funding of €25 million, a gross provision of €379.6 million is available to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2020, representing an increase of 12% on the comparable allocation for 2019. An additional €3.4 million in funding has been carried over from the 2019 capital provision for expenditure on priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures. In broad terms, the 2020 breakdown of allocations to the Vote is as follows. Just under €218 million is allocated for culture. This includes €100 million for the Arts Council, €48.9 million for the national cultural institutions, €21 million for Screen Ireland, €9.5 million for cultural infrastructure and development and €14.8 million for regional museums, galleries, cultural centres and projects. Some €62.6 million is allocated for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage. This includes: €13.7 million for natural heritage; €10 million for peatlands restoration, conservation and management, including €5 million from the carbon tax fund; just over €6.6 million for the Heritage Council; and just over €6.8 million for built heritage including the very successful built heritage investment scheme and the Irish Heritage Trust.There is €58 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands, including €23.7 million for Údarás na Gaeltachta, just under €9 million for the islands and €3.7 million for the 20-year strategy for the Irish language. There is also just over €41 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga. The gross allocation for the Department in 2020 is 12% higher than the comparable figure in 2019 and allows for increases in funding across a range of bodies under the Department’s remit, as well as increases in funding for a number of culture, heritage and Gaeltacht schemes. This increased funding is targeted at a number of key initiatives. In the case of the culture programme, 2020 funding is 15% higher than the 2019 equivalent. Of its priorities, Arts Council funding is up by 33% to €100 million, including €20 million in response to the Covid pandemic. Among the measures that will be introduced will be new bursaries and commissions, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. With this funding, the arts sector will be stabilised in 2020, art will continue to be created, artists will be employed and the public will continue to have access to the arts, sometimes in new and imaginative ways. Funding for our national cultural institutions amounts to €48.9 million in total. Since the lockdown began on 12 March, these institutions have done a wonderful job in responding to the Covid crisis by providing online content of the highest quality on their websites. Clearly, this is no substitute for being able to visit a gallery, library or museum and I am delighted that most of these institutions have now reopened to the public, albeit with a slightly different visitor experience on offer. Those yet to reopen, such as the National Concert Hall, face somewhat different challenges as a consequence of the Covid crisis, but I have no doubt that they will overcome these challenges and welcome patrons across their thresholds again before too much longer. There is dedicated funding of just under €15 million for regional museums, galleries, cultural centres and projects to provide robust supports that ensure their viability and sustainability and secure new online cultural and creative content. Funding of €12.5 million, including €3 million carried over from 2019, in respect of cultural infrastructure and development will ensure that momentum is maintained in the delivery of a suite of ambitious capital programmes and projects as part of Project Ireland 2040. Fís Éireann, or Screen Ireland, is to receive additional funding of €1 million. It follows the Government’s decision to extend the section 481 film tax credit to 2024 and the regional uplift of 5%, which provides an additional incentive to increase Irish and international production across the regions. These measures are in line with the audiovisual action plan, which sets out the Government’s ambition to make Ireland a global hub for the production of film, television drama and animation. Also under the culture heading, an additional €900,000 is being made available for 2020's decade of centenaries programme. This will enable the delivery of a significant programme of commemorative events, including Bloody Sunday on 21 November and the execution of Kevin Barry on 1 November, in an appropriate and meaningful manner consistent with the advice of the expert advisory group. While the restrictions necessarily imposed as part of the Covid-19 crisis management measures will potentially require a reimagining of the commemorative events originally envisaged, it remains critical that all pivotal moments in the history of our nation continue to be remembered in an appropriate and meaningful way. Funding for the heritage programme in 2020 is €62.6 million, an increase of 16% on the 2019 allocation. The largest increase in the programme is in respect of peatlands restoration, conservation and management, where an increase of €2 million, or 67%, plus a further €5 million from the carbon tax fund will result in an allocation of €10 million for 2020 compared to the 2019 allocation of €3 million. This increased funding will allow for an accelerated programme of peatlands restoration and conservation works, resulting in 1,800 ha of restored peatland in 2020, the generation of 100 jobs in the midlands and ultimately the storage of 28 million tonnes of carbon. Restoration and rehabilitation of raised bogs will provide multiple additional ecosystem services, such as water and air quality improvements, flood mitigation, biodiversity enhancement and opportunities for tourism development, and contribute to the social and economic well-being of local communities. An additional €1 million is being provided in 2020 to accelerate key nature conservation and biodiversity programmes under the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Funding for the farm plan programme is being doubled in 2020 to €1 million to support measures to protect biodiversity and assist farmers with lands designated as special areas of conservation in their role as custodians of nature. Also under the heritage programme, Ireland’s national parks and reserves will continue to be supported, including the tourism interpretative master plan, under which the Government is investing to enhance visitor centre experiences and facilities in 2020. These parks and reserves have provided a welcome refuge to many during the past few months when restrictions on movement limited travel and interaction. It was a welcome reunion with the wealth of natural beauty on their doorstep and it is critical that these wonderful natural amenities continue to be available in their optimum iteration for all who wish to enjoy them. Labhróidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Calleary, faoi na gnéithe a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge, an nGaeltacht agus na hoileáin.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In terms of North-South co-operation, a provision of more than €41 million is made available to support the two North-South implementation bodies, An Foras Teanga, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, and Waterways Ireland. These allocations are also subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council. I am satisfied that the 2020 allocation of €379.6 million for the Vote of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes. We, as a nation, are beginning to emerge from the public health restrictions necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. I am confident that the Department is equipped to provide the necessary supports and assistance to the relevant sectors and their myriad stakeholders to ensure they all emerge together and stronger. I am happy to take any questions Deputies may have in respect of the 2020 Vote of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I again ask that the questions be confined to these programme areas, notwithstanding the broader remit of my ministerial responsibilities.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Freagróidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Calleary, na ceisteanna faoin nGaeltacht, má tá sé sin ceart go leor. I acknowledge that Deputy Ó Snodaigh and his family are deeply connected to and steeped in culture and the arts. I recognise the invaluable contribution that his family has made to the arts and culture sector. This Revised Estimate comprises the allocation from last year's October budget plus the additional €25 million announced last month. That €25 million for the arts and culture reflects the significant role that they play in our individual lives and across society as a whole. With regard to the Deputy's question about repurposing money, we are halfway through the year and 48% of our money has been spent. Our intention is to spend all the money but we will repurpose if necessary. We did that already with "Other Voices: Courage" and Ireland Performs. All funding remains in place for our cultural institutions. We have an ambitious capital development programme for all cultural institutions, including the museum. As Minister in this area, I am aware that the arts and culture sector is on its knees. This is a crisis. I am aware that arts and culture go to the being of who we are as a nation. Our culture, arts and music are a celebration of who we are as a nation. They must be supported. The crisis has emphasised the importance of our arts and creativity in all of our lives. I pledge that I will work with my Department officials and State bodies in consultation with stakeholders to ensure that the talent and creativity of Ireland's performers, writers, music-makers and makers of everything in the arts world are developed to their full potential, sustained and stay alive to be once again enjoyed by widespread audiences nationally and internationally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is not the July stimulus package; this is last October's budget with the addition of the €25 million announced last month. Some €20 million of that has gone to the Arts Council and the other €5 million will be allocated. I am still new to the role, but I am working on that to support the other artists the Deputy mentioned and those who work in the industry. I am keenly aware of how they are struggling and the supports they need. This is last October's budget and not this the July stimulus package. Regarding that July stimulus package, I am that voice at Cabinet. I am working on that and the discussions are under way on it. I am advocating for the arts and culture sector at Cabinet. On the night-time economy task force, I am getting to grips with my brief. It is moving quite fast, but I am completely up for that challenge. I will be meeting representatives of the Arts Council this week. I hope to establish this month an arts task force with voices from the entire sector on how best to support them. As the Deputy said, there is a commitment there with the night-time economy task force as well. I will be looking at how best to protect that night-time culture. Does the Deputy have further questions?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. I am that voice pushing for more funding and supports for the arts and culture sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy compared the €25 million with the supports given across the water. Making comparisons across different countries is difficult for many reasons, including population size and the nature of the arts and entertainment sectors. For example, the UK has a very large commercial theatre sector. According to the EU, the arts and culture share of public expenditure in Ireland in recent years has been broadly in line with the EU average. The Arts Council has established an expert advisory group to make recommendations on measures to support the arts. The recent allocation of that additional €25 million to the sector, including the €20 million to the Arts Council, was a direct response to the need identified by that expert advisory group. It is also very much in line with the recommendations of the National Campaign for the Arts. I am very mindful of the concerns of people working in the sector. I am absolutely willing to meet all stakeholders. That is my intention and it is what I will be doing. Local authorities have well developed connections with local historical groups and are very effective in supporting a wide range of events, for example, commemorative events.The creative communities initiative is being implemented via the local authorities, largely through a joint investment programme of €8.7 million supported by Creative Ireland and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. We will continue to protect that. The Deputy also mentioned discretionary funding. I will sit down with officials in my Department and tease out how best to deal with that matter. I am keenly aware of the struggles and crises that are there and if Deputies will bear with me, I am determined to include and listen to all stakeholders as we seek to support them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am quite happy to answer. I welcome the Deputy's engagement which is always highly constructive and helpful on these areas and working with the communities involved. I am aware that options exist in respect of turf cutters which include relocation to non-designated bogs, annual compensation payments and in some instances lump sum payments. My colleague, Deputy Noonan, will have responsibility for this and I will bring the matter to his attention. I will also bring the issue to his attention in respect of the roll-out of broadband and hedge cutting.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ar an gcéad dul síos caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil, mar is eol don Teachta, an-suim agus an-ghrá agam don Ghaeilge. Úsáidim í chomh minic agus is féidir liom. Beidh mé féin agus an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Calleary, ag tabhairt cuairte ar an nGaeltacht an mhí seo. Is i nGaeilge a rinne mé mo chéad agallamh. If the Deputy can bear with me as regards Galway 2020, táim chun an cheist sin a fhreagairt i mBéarla agus beidh sé níos soiléire, I hope, ansin. I have received a request from Galway 2020 to continue funding for a repurposed programme. The current Covid-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant impact on the delivery of Galway 2020. The Department has indicated approval for Galway 2020 to re-engage with cultural partners from the original bid book to examine options for the delivery of a revised cultural programme in light of Covid-19 impacts. On this basis, Galway 2020 is proposing a revised cultural programme comprising 27 projects from the original winning bid book, many of which will include multiple events to be held over the period from July to March 2021. The proposed format for delivery is on the basis that social distancing requirements will remain in place, with delivery methods to include limited access physical performance, exhibition installations and a significant element of digital delivery. One cultural partner has indicated that it will not be possible to deliver its proposed events by the end of March 2021. A request for the prolongation of the cultural programme to April 2021 has been sent to the European Commission to allow time for delivery in changed circumstances and a response is awaited. The unspent elements of committed local authority funding is no longer guaranteed and there is no expectation of further private sponsorship, leaving the Government as the sole funder. As I said, I have received a request from Galway 2020 to continue funding for a repurposed programme and I hope to make a decision on this shortly. I ask the Deputy to bear with me as I am only a few days in this brief. The matter has been brought to my attention and I am dealing with it. Gabhaim buíochas léi.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On Deputy Cathal Crowe's question regarding Shannon Heritage, we are critically aware of the issues facing the heritage sector, as well as the arts and cultural sector. As a Government, we are working with all stakeholders to ensure facilities can reopen safely and to stabilise them financially. As requested by the Deputy, I will raise this matter with my colleagues in government, including the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who will have responsibility for heritage. In terms of my new remit, I am also very conscious of it from a tourism perspective. On the issues raised by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, as I have previously stated, the Covid-19 crisis has emphasised the importance of our arts and creativity in all of our lives. Along with my Department officials and State bodies I am working with all stakeholders to ensure that the talent and creativity of our performers, writers and music makers is developed to their potential and sustained and enjoyed once again by audiences in our local communities, at national level and globally. The impact of Covid has been deep across the sector. Live performances to audiences will be impacted long-term. This is one of the sectors that was first hit and it will be the last to return. I am very aware of that. On live performances, my Department is engaging with EPIC and the entertainment industry in order to ways to sustain them.I fully agree we have built a skilled labour force in that sector and we want to protect and continue to work with the sector. As I said, it was the first to go and will be the last to return. I am fully aware that the arts and culture sector is heavily dependent on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the temporary wage subsidy scheme and that an extension of the former has been sought by the National Campaign for the Arts. As the Deputy may be aware, the programme for Government states that, as part of the July stimulus package, the Government will set out a pathway for the future implementation of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the future distribution of the PUP based on the principles of fairness and equity. As he rightly noted, these are industries where seasonal workers must be considered. That is on my radar and I seek to address it. The work is under way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy and all Deputies who have expressed their good wishes to me and the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary. I look forward to working with them all. While the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the equality budgeting programme, my Department was one of six that participated in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's equality budgeting pilot in 2018. Dedicated equality indicators were included in the 2018 Revised Estimates with the objective to work to achieve enhanced levels of representation of women and girls in films and screen content supported by the Irish Film Board. Equality budgeting uses impact indicators to provide information on how the allocation of resources impacts various groups in society, such as women, children and disadvantaged groups. While the pilot scheme focused mainly on gender in 2018, with five gender objectives and one socioeconomic objective, the scope was broadened in 2019 to include other equality measures such as poverty, the promotion of inclusiveness and disability. My Department has engaged, and will continue to do so, with this process annually. While an equality budgeting advisory group has been established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to support this process, my Department is not a member of the group. I am very supportive of equality budgeting as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights. With regard to the pilot programme, a key lesson for my Department was the value in setting metrics as a means of driving policy change. In 2018, for example, the Irish Film Board, or Screen Ireland as it is now known, launched a scheme, POV, that was aimed at delivering on Screen Ireland's commitment to achieving a 50:50 gender parity in the Irish screen industries, both in front of and behind the camera. Screen Ireland offered enhanced production funding for female-initiated or female-driven feature films. Screen Ireland surpassed its 2018 equality budgeting targets of 5%, achieving an increase of 12% in the number of applications with female talent attached and an increase of 7% in the number of successful applications with female talent attached. Equality budgeting provides an objective way to track and measure success in this area. A key lesson learned from participation in the pilot was that linking funding decisions to greater gender equality has paid dividends in encouraging greater equality in the film industry and provides a positive model to replicate in other policy areas. Screen Ireland is confident that 2020 will build on the success of 2018 and 2019 in terms of the participation of women in screen productions. It is my strong belief that extending equality budgeting to other policy areas in my Department will incentivise and reward positive change towards greater equality, and I will seek to expand this success into areas in the Department. To respond to the Deputy's third question, my Department is very cognisant of the recommendations contained in the OECD report on equality budgeting. While the report recognises that equality budgeting in Ireland is in its infancy, I am pleased my Department has participated in Ireland's initiative since its inception. In recent years my Department and its bodies have engaged in a number of initiatives to promote inclusion and equality in the context of gender participation in the arts and culture sector. This work has involved staff in the culture and corporate divisions and external staff in agencies under the Department's remit working together to achieve gender balance on State boards in the arts and culture sector, which I am pleased to say stands at 49%. The project focused on support for women at a senior level in arts organisations, support for promotion to the public of the work of women artists, leadership in dealing with accusations of abuse of power and sexual harassment in sections of the arts sector, and diversity and equality training for boards and senior management of State agencies in the sector. This work was the subject of a Civil Service excellence and innovation award in 2019. My Department will continue to focus on equality when developing policy and will be proactive in ensuring that our strategic objectives underpin equality of opportunity, access and outcomes in the arts for everyone living Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	My Department is leading on the programme for Government's key commitment to establish a night-time economy task force. The aim of the proposed task force will be to look at innovative approaches to supporting and developing a vibrant, diverse night-time culture and economy in Ireland, and it is intended that the key Departments, agencies and relevant groups will be represented on this task force at senior level. The task force will build on the work carried out already in the Department in this area, which included a symposium to investigate the possibility of creative nightlife and cultural activity after hours and the establishment of pilot projects in both Cork and Dublin, which intended to provide a more detailed insight into the specific issues facing the development of a night-time culture and to seek wider public views. The task force will examine progress on these measures to date and examine more complex issues, including issues around licensing laws and regulations governing our night-time culture at national and local level. Part of the role of the task force will also be to examine the establishment of night-time culture mayors in Cork and Dublin, a role that some other European cities have already established. We know that many businesses and creative practitioners which depend on the night-time economy are suffering huge losses due to the necessary restrictions caused by Covid-19, and the work of this task force is even more important in this context. The support and co-operation of key Departments, agencies and local authorities will be vital to the success of this initiative, and my Department is writing to them to seek nominations to the task force. As the Deputy said, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish this task force within the first 30 days, and I am happy to confirm that I will be announcing the establishment of this task force next week. The task force will consult and inform the various interested groups who have been involved in the development of this initiative as the work progresses.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To address the issue that the Deputy has raised, the membership of the task force is under consideration, but it is likely to include some key Departments, for example, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Departments responsible for climate action and transport, and for housing, local government and heritage. On licensing, I anticipate that a wide range of public bodies will have a strong role to play in this but the licensing issue will be under the Department of Justice and Equality. That is why I hope we will have An Garda Síochána on the task force. To address transport issues, we will have the Department responsible for climate action and transport represented there. The idea is that the task force will engage with all relevant groups to bring the necessary knowledge in to make it effective.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to say also that I will be recommending that someone from Give Us The Night, who made a detailed submission to us, will be part of that task force. It is my intention to invite them. One of the recommendations in their submission was the expansion of the 24-hour night transport services etc. which the Deputy mentioned. We will be looking at all of those issues. They are complex but we intend to address them and have someone from Give Us The Night on the task force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree that the entire arts community and those who work in it have taken a massive hit. They were the first impacted, and due to the very nature of their activities, they may be the last to return. We need our arts now more than ever. They defines us as a people. Since the advent of the crisis, officials from my Department have been actively engaging with the sector and continuing to engage with the agencies under its remit and other sectoral stakeholders to ensure that there is the greatest level of awareness of the available supports and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to best support this sector at this challenging time. On businesses involved in the entertainment industry, such as SMEs and sole traders, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, commercial rates write-offs and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in the management of their companies, and to allow them to begin to look into the future and start charting a path forward for the weeks and months ahead. The Government has also extended its two universal income support measures for all sectors, and further measures will also be set out in the forthcoming July stimulus, which will build on the existing suite of supports introduced since the pandemic began and will aim to help sustain incomes, boost business and kick-start the various sectors. Furthermore, the Government has committed to bringing forward a national economic plan, to be published alongside the budget in October, which will outline the Government's plans to support the long-term sustainability of the economy. Details of the July stimulus will be announced shortly, but I can assure the Deputy that I am on the Cabinet subcommittee for economic recovery, and I am acutely aware of the pressure facing the sector in light of the public health guidance. They have a voice at Cabinet and a voice on that Cabinet subcommittee. As I said, I am acutely aware of their needs and am pushing for everything in the July stimulus package.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am examining a whole suite of measures because that is what is needed to support this sector. As I have said, my Department has met with a wide range of stakeholders from across the arts and culture sector in recent months. The programme for Government commits to establishing a cross-departmental task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the views of all stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector throughout the Covid recovery and beyond, which in turn will inform the national economic plan.Officials from my Department have met with the live entertainment sector which has sought a range of supports, including an extension of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, a waiver of business rates and establishment of that cross-departmental task force. I am considering a whole suite of supports for them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I am fighting for a whole range of supports. That specific matter is one for my colleagues in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Finance. I am seeking all measures to support the community. With regard to online content, it is not enough for people to say we value our artists or they are invaluable to our economy and well-being. We have to pay them for the content, and I am working on a whole range of solutions and have been engaging to see how we can do that. We must, in this context of Covid-19, explore, develop and pay our artists for new platforms to enjoy what they bring to society. As I said, it is crucial our artists are paid for what they provide us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Galway 2020, like so many cultural and artistic organisations around Ireland and, indeed, the world, has been deeply impacted, with a significant number of events cancelled or postponed. On 29 April last, Galway 2020 received approval from my predecessor to re-engage with the cultural partners from the original winning bid for the European Capital of Culture to explore the options for project delivery in the context of the evolving public health situation. On 10 July, following consideration and review, I approved a reimagined cultural programme for Galway 2020. While the reimagined programme is scaled down compared with that originally planned, it will still see more than 350 Irish artists work on the delivery of a range of projects covering the broad spectrum of art forms and addressing the varied sectors of society, including children, youth and older people, the Traveller community, people with intellectual and sensory disabilities and hospital patients. As part of the approval I have made it a requirement that all projects comply fully with public health advice and that all stakeholders remain informed on the evolving public health situation and employ appropriate contingency measures with regard to project delivery. There will also be close monitoring by both Galway 2020 and my Department of the progress on all projects. As the Deputy can appreciate, Galway 2020 has incurred significant reductions in its staffing levels over recent months due to the pandemic, with only seven full-time equivalent staff members remaining. Notwithstanding this, the Irish language remains one of the three central themes of Galway 2020, and seven of the 28 approved projects are either solely in the Irish language or fully bilingual. While I understand it was not possible to retain an Irish language officer, Galway 2020 will be engaging with Irish language organisations on a plan it will devise for the community as part of its delivery of the programme. The Government commitment of €15 million to Galway 2020 remains in place with an allocation of €7.1 million in 2020, of which €2.819 million has been paid to date. As per the terms of the performance delivery agreement between the Department and Galway 2020, funding has been spent on cultural programming, programme production staffing costs and costs associated with the operation of the Galway 2020 volunteer programme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government has committed €15 million to the project. Of this, €6.9 million was paid in 2017 and 2019. A total of €7.1 million is committed for 2020, of which, €2.82 million has been drawn to date. The €1 million balance from the commitment is due for payment in 2021. Galway City Council has committed €6 million in total to the project. A total of €2.2 million of this was expanded during the bid phase, resulting in a commitment of €3.848 million for the delivery phase. A total of €3.117 million of this commitment has been paid to date. As a result of the severe impact on revenue streams of the city council, the future funding situation is uncertain. Galway County Council has committed €3.5 million with an additional €500,000 earmarked for legacy initiatives in the county. Galway 2020 has cash-sponsored commitments of €968,000, with €398,000 paid to date. Having received approval to resume the programme, Galway 2020 will re-engage with all sponsors to establish if they wish to continue with sponsorship in light of the changed environment. Galway 2020 has sold €83,000 in ticketing prior to the Covid-19 crisis. A total of €55,000 has been refunded for cancelled or postponed events. Should the programme resume, tickets will be sold again. Otherwise, further refunds will be issued. It is time-limited but I will get my officials to write to the Deputy on that issue and on the conditions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the Irish language officer, I did not get an opportunity in the previous time I had to address it, and I am very aware that the Gaeltacht is under my remit. I am sure the Deputy is aware that I am genuinely committed to the promotion and use of our native tongue. It is so unfortunate that the Irish language officer, Ms Freda Nic Giolla Chatháin, who was fantastic, has been made redundant due to the financial and operational constraints. I am conscious of that strong Irish language theme and will re-engage with Galway 2020 and discuss this further with the board, because I am genuinely committed to the promotion of Galway. As Deputy Connolly said, it is a bilingual city and I will see what I can do on that.I will get back to the Deputy with further details regarding the two other questions. I will get my officials to write to Deputy Connolly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On 19 June the then Government, having considered the expert public health advice provided by the national public health emergency team, approved the rephasing of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. Apart from some exceptions, most sectors were brought forward to phase 3, which began on Monday, 29 June. Museums, galleries, theatres, concert halls and other cultural outlets could reopen from that date but the current restrictions on a maximum of 50 people at indoor gatherings and 200 people at outdoor gatherings have been extended to 10 August. There is no denying that due to social distancing and public confidence issues, the reopening of live performance and entertainment venues will prove challenging. The Government is committed, in the context of budget 2021, to bring forward a national economic plan setting out our long-term approach to restore employment, and detailing how we will secure our public finances in a world where we must live with Covid-19 while driving our efforts to decarbonise the economy and prepare for the next phases of technological transformation. The programme for Government also commits to establishing a cross-departmental task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the views of all stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid-19 recovery and beyond, which in turn will inform the national economic plan. This task force will be established shortly. It will build on additional supports already provided in the form of the increase in Arts Council funding to €100 million this year. The additional €20 million was in line with the recommendations of the expert advisory group to the Arts Council, and of the National Campaign for the Arts' 13 point national arts recovery plan. The additional measures to be announced in the context of the July stimulus will further support employment-intensive activities within the sector. In all of these actions, the Government remains focused on sustaining the arts and culture sector through the challenges posed by Covid-19.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. In the few weeks since I was appointed, I have been concentrating on the July stimulus package to see what supports I can give immediately to the sector, which has been devastated by Covid. In answer to Deputy Duncan Smith's earlier question, I mentioned the commitment in the programme for Government on the night-time economy task force, which will be announced next week. I am working on the art sector task force. In recent months, we have been engaging with a range of stakeholders from throughout the arts and culture sector. Of the €25 million funding, €20 million went to the Arts Council. This is leading to new bursaries and commissions, including supports for freelance artists and those seeking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. I will establish this task force and it is a priority. We have to do it right and engage properly. As I said, the immediate short-term priority for me was the July stimulus package and those supports. I am on the Cabinet sub-committee and I am fighting for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As he pointed out, this is a matter for my colleagues at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Finance. As I have said, I am examining a suite of measures to support the arts sector. We have been particularly focused on the very challenging issue of how live performances can be delivered in the context of public health restrictions. Such opportunities will be important for collective well-being but also from an employment perspective. The contribution the arts and culture make to our society has an economic value and also has a value to our well-being as a nation, so it is a priority. As stated, I am examining a suite of measures. This specific measure is a matter for my colleagues at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Finance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes and look forward to working with him and all other Deputies in the House. My Department runs a small-scale local festivals and summer school scheme. Funding available under the scheme is typically capped at €5,000. Full details of the scheme are available from my Department's website. Applications for 2020 closed on 24 April and details of allocations may also be found on the website.There were no applications from County Clare to my Department's 2020 small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme. The Arts Council funds a number of festivals in County Clare under its festival investment scheme. All funding decisions can be viewed on the Arts Council website. The list of festivals that the Arts Council funded in County Clare in 2019, under its programme festival scheme, included funding of €3,000 for the Feakle International Traditional Musical Festival. Also under the scheme, Consairtín 2019, the National Concertina Convention, received €5,000, Ennis Book Club Festival received €25,500, Iniscealtra Arts Festival received €9,500, Killaloe Chamber Music Festival received €16,000, Oidhreacht an Chlair received €3,467 for the Seventh Annual Concertina Cruinniú and Sixmilebridge Folk Club received €5,000 for the Shannonside Winter Music Festival. It is important to note that, under the Arts Act, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its funding decisions. Therefore, neither my officials nor I have any input into the disbursement of funding. Fáilte Ireland provides support to large-scale festivals and participative events through its national programme. At the start of the Covid-19 crisis, Fáilte Ireland immediately paid 50% of the festivals' agreed funding within the programme. Fáilte Ireland is working with these festivals to establish whether they will go ahead and, where appropriate, helping to develop revised programming. The remainder of the funding will be provided based on these revised programmes. Fáilte Ireland also administers a regional festivals programme and funding has been paid in full to the local authorities. It also runs an innovation programme for new festivals but this programme has been temporarily suspended and no new applications are being considered at present.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the value of local festivals, their links to the community from a cultural perspective and how they can boost the tourism sector and local economies. As I said, many festivals have had to cancel this year's events and we must look at how we can support those types of events in the future. That issue will be examined by the task force. We must reimagine how we do these things. I will ask my officials to engage with the Deputy on the Shannon Heritage sites and answer his question in writing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Deputy that these festivals are part of the unique fabric of rural Ireland. The Arts Council is currently accepting applications for funding under round 1 of the festivals investment scheme for festivals taking place between January and June of next year. There are three bands of funding available: band A provides funding up to €7,000; band B provides funding of between €7,000 and €20,000; and band C provides funding of between €20,000 and €35,000. The closing date for applications for further supports is 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, 23 July. I bring that to the Deputy's attention. The festivals and events industry, and the broader tourism sector, are facing severe limitations and challenges in these exceptional times. Therefore, Fáilte Ireland is working to redefine the scope of the festivals innovation programme into the future. For that reason, the programme has been temporarily suspended and no applications are being considered but that is because we are trying to reinvent how it can be done and improve the scope of the programme.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta. B'ionann leithroinnt mhaoinithe phoiblí TG4 agus €37.2 milliún in 2020, leithroinnt a bhí comhdhéanta de €34.2 milliún i gcaiteachas reatha agus €3 milliún i gcaiteachas caipitil. Fuair m'oifigigh comhfhreagras ó TG4 ar 11 Meán Fómhair inar iarradh €1.9 milliún i maoiniú breise don bhliain 2020 i ndáil le costais bhreise a bhain le Covid. Aithním gur bliain thar a bheith dúshlánach a bhí inti do gach earnáil agus go raibh dúshláin ar leith i gceist le hiad i dtionscail na cruthaitheachta. Táthar ag lorg tuilleadh faisnéise ó TG4 maidir leis an iarratas ar mhaoiniú agus tá m'oifigigh i dteagmháil leis ina leith sin. Táim ag labhairt faoi seo mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as na meáin, as an nGaeltacht agus as an gcultúr. Tuigim an obair atá déanta ag TG4 chun foinsí nuachta, oideachas agus faisnéis seirbhíse poiblí a chur ar fáil i rith na tréimhse seo. Tá an sceideal coinnithe ag TG4 mar atá agus tá sé curtha in oiriúint aige le freagairt ar riachtanais a lucht féachana in ainneoin gur bhain dúshláin léiriúcháin leis sin de bharr na srianta sláinte. Tá ról tábhachtach ag seirbhísí craoltóireachta a chuirtear ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge i straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge an Rialtais. Is ríthábhachtach atá TG4 ina leith sin. Tá ról tábhachtach aige i dtreo cultúr na Gaeilge agus an Ghaeilge í féin a chur faoi bhráid lucht féachana a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Cuireann sé ábhar nuálach agus ábhartha ar fáil trína sheirbhísí teilifíse agus ar líne. Chomh maith leis sin, mar chraoltóir foilseacháin, cuireann sé tacaíocht thábhachtach ar fáil d'earnáil na cruthaitheachta in Éirinn. Chaith sé €23,000 in 2019 sa réimse sin. Tá na meáin Ghaeilge ag teacht laistigh de chúram an choimisiúin um thodhchaí na meán, coimisiún a d'fhógair mé féin agus an Taoiseach ar 29 Meán Fómhair chun féachaint ar an bhfís amach anseo do na meáin seirbhíse poiblí. Tá sé beartaithe agam chomh maith cruinniú a bheith agam le TG4 sna seachtainí amach romhainn. Táim ag súil leis an mbealach ina mbeidh sé ábalta leanúint ag fás agus tacú tuilleadh leis an nGaeilge a phlé leis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Rinne an Teachta Ó Snodaigh tagairt don chlár "Cúla4 ar Scoil", clár a choimisiúnaigh TG4. Soláthraíonn an clár seo seirbhís chuimsitheach do scoileanna Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoileanna chun foghlaim i nGaeilge a éascú don lucht féachana. Clúdaíonn sé na príomhábhair: an Ghaeilge, matamaitic, stair agus tíreolaíocht. Bhí áthas orm a nótáil freisin go bhfuil an clár ag clúdach ranganna cruthaitheacha ar na healaíona, ar na healaíona traidisiúnta agus ar shláinte agus folláine. Mar gheall ar an mbeartas seo, bhí costas breise de €1.9 milliún le clúdach ag TG4 i mbliana. Tá iarratas á dhéanamh agam chun tacaíocht airgeadais a fháil i mbliana i leith na costais Covid seo. Mar is eol don Teachta, tá grá agam ar TG4 agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun gach tacaíocht a thabhairt dó, don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, táim ag súil le cruinniú a bheith agam le TG4 sna seachtainí atá romhainn.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá m’oifigigh i mbun idirchaidrimh le TG4 maidir leis an iarratas do mhaoiniú bhreise agus tá siad ag lorg tuilleadh faisnéise. Measfar an t-iarratas nuair a fhaightear an fhaisnéis sin. Beidh mé i mbun idirchaidrimh leis an Aire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe maidir le riachtanais maoinithe mo Roinne don bhliain 2021 mar chuid den phróiseas Meastacháin. Ní féidir a rá ag an bpointe seo cén t-airgead a chuirfear ar fáil d’aon ghníomhaireacht go dtí go n-aontaíonn an Rialtas leis sin. D’éirigh liom maoiniú breise de €2 milliún a fháil i bpacáiste spreagadh mhí Iúil don scéim fís agus fuaim agus tá sé sin ar fáil do gach craoltóir. Seolfaidh mé aon eolas breise ag an Teachta Dála níos déanaí inniu.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am acutely aware of the enormous and unprecedented challenges which face the tourism and hospitality sectors as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.Almost all tourism businesses were initially required to close to comply with the necessary public health measures introduced. Many have since reopened but, unfortunately, the majority of businesses are operating with significantly reduced levels of turnover compared with 2019 as a result of the ongoing public health measures and the almost complete absence of overseas tourists coming into the country. This has meant that many jobs in the sector have been lost or remain vulnerable. Along with my colleagues in government, I have taken a number of measures to help the sector survive this crisis. The July stimulus package introduced significant measures to help businesses recover following the devastating impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality include the stay and spend initiative, the €26 million adaptation grant, the €10 million grant for coach tourism and the revised restart grant, which now includes bed and breakfast establishments. Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal support, such as the new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates. As part of its response to Covid-19 and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, Fáilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year, and I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home. All of these measures have helped the sector, but I appreciate that severe challenges remain and there is justified deep concern in the sector. We need to continue to examine ways to ensure businesses survive and recover. The tourism recovery task force, appointed in May, has just submitted its report to me. It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector survive the crisis and recover. That will feed into the roadmap the Deputy refers to in her question. Along with my colleagues in government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the budget and the subsequent national economic plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While absolutely necessary, the public health guidelines disproportionately impact the sectors supported by my Department, namely, tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sports and media. I have had extensive engagement with people representing those working in the tourism and hospitality sector and will continue to do so. As the Deputy said, at the beginning of the year tourism supported 270,000 direct and indirect jobs. That is one in ten of all jobs. The IHF has estimated another 100,000 jobs are at risk. I am aware of the pressure they are under. On the stay and spend initiative, the purpose of that was to support the accommodation and food sector during the off-season, not during the peak season. That is what was flagged to us as what was needed. There was concern about the season between October and April. However, this is a fast-paced pandemic and we are in a different position now to July when we launched what was a very innovative scheme. The country was reopening then but now we are dealing with much harsher restrictions on already devastated sectors. Given that, it is natural to assess if the initiative is providing the full benefit that was planned in July.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is why I have been engaging with them extensively. One of the first things I did as a Minister, on day two, was to meet with the sector. On the stay and spend initiative, that is exactly what I said in my answer: it needs to be reassessed. I take that on board. That is why I am saying that in this Chamber. It is because of the fast-paced nature of this horrifying pandemic and how it is impacting on the sector. The tourism recovery task force report landed with me this week. I am reading that and will give it consideration. As the pandemic evolves, the Government will consider what are the best supports and measures which can be introduced to support businesses and employment. I will be discussing this with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of the budget and in my role as a member of the Cabinet committee on economic recovery. The people who represent that sector and other individuals I have spoken to know I voice that at Cabinet and will continue to do so. That means everything has to be considered. As far as I am concerned, everything is on the table in the context of the budget.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The programme for Government has expanded the remit of the public service broadcasting commission to become a future of media commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media on a platform-agnostic fashion. The programme for Government calls for a report within nine months on the measures that need to be taken to ensure there is a vibrant, independent public service media for the next generation. It notes that the current funding model for public service broadcasting is inefficient and the commission will publish recommendations. The commission is being established by the Department of the Taoiseach in liaison with my Department, and the terms of reference and membership were approved by the Government on 29 September. The goal of the independent commission is to identify what the Irish experience has been in delivering the above aims through public service broadcasters, or broadcasters, print and online media at a local, regional and national levels, and the challenges created for these media by new global platforms and change in audience preference for the delivery of content. It will consider the extent to which the current models of delivery are appropriate for the next ten years and review the best practice in other comparable jurisdictions, particularly across the European economic area, in terms of providing future-proofed models for meeting the above public services in light of changing audience expectations, in particular the preferences and behaviours of younger audiences. Within this context, the commission will examine how these aims can be delivered in a way that is sustainable, give greater security of funding, ensure independent editorial oversight and deliver value for money to the public. It will also make recommendations on RTÉ's role, financing and structure within this framework. It is expected that the commission will engage in a wide-ranging consultation with all relevant stakeholders and sectors to ensure that all relevant perspectives are considered in its work.  In light of its remit, I expect that the licence fee will be among the issues examined by the commission. I believe it is important to allow the commission the time and space to undertake its work and any recommendations made about the funding model and licence fee will be considered by the Government. In the meantime, An Post, which acts as my issuing agent for licence fee collection, will continue to sell television licences and free licences will continue to be issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to qualifying applicants under the household benefit scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The future of the media commission also has consideration of the Irish language and media within its remit. I made sure to have someone on the commission who is fluent in Irish and works in the sector. I recognise the work TG4 has done in providing an important source of news, education and public service information during this time, maintaining and adapting its schedule to respond to its audience needs despite the production challenge posed by the health restrictions. The delivery of broadcasting services through the medium of Irish plays a vital role in the implementation of the Government's 20-year strategy for the Irish language and TG4 has been essential in that regard. TG4 plays an important role in bringing Irish language and culture to Irish-speaking audiences, providing innovative and relevant content through television and its online services. In addition, as a publisher and broadcaster, it also provides valuable support to the Irish creative sector, spending €23 million in 2019. I look forward to the recommendations of the commission in this regard. As the Deputy said, there is a need to support quality journalism and media now more than ever. I am committed to doing so and that includes RTÉ but I do not want to pre-empt the work of the commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As I said, the licence fee will be discussed in the context of the commission. I do not want to interfere with the work of the commission.I am aware that evasion is currently estimated to be at 12.57% even though An Post makes every effort to bring the evaders into the licence pool with reminder notifications and inspections. There is also an increasing number of homes, approximately 11%, which have televisions and do not pay a fee.  I cannot pre-empt the work of a commission, the members of which will serve really well. The NUJ has written to me and sent me its report, which I will bring to the attention of the chair of the future of media commission. As I said, there will be extensive engagement with all stakeholders. The print sector was added to the commission as an acknowledgement by the Government that it is at risk. We have to acknowledge that and see how best to provide a road forward for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism, arts, culture and sport are integral parts of the fabric of society, supporting economic activity and physical and societal well-being. The public facing and audience driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation for any county in the level applicable under the living with Covid plan those sectors will be hardest hit. The Government is acutely aware of these challenges. The need for important public health measures, such as social distancing, has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect public health. This has had a devastating impact, which the Government and I, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, culture, arts, the Gaeltacht, sports and media, have sought to address in a range of ways. Some key measures have been introduced to help support the tourism, arts, culture and sports sectors, including an additional €25 million for the Arts Council, a €5 million live events pilot grant scheme, €5 million to support national cultural institutions and nationwide arts infrastructure, the stay and spend tax credit initiative, a €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector, a €10 million grant for coach tourism, €40 million for the three main field sport its bodies, the GAA, IRFU and FAI, and a €15 million resilience fund for sports governance bodies and clubs.  The universal income support of PUP and the wage subsidy scheme have been key to supporting sectors through this crisis and the extension of these schemes has provided certainty for the coming months. My officials and I are in regular contact with stakeholders and representatives in all of the sectors for which I have responsibility. I have established a number of sector specific task forces. I have considered the views and recommendations of these task forces in the context of budget 2021 and the development of the national economic plan, and will review and refine existing support as required. I intend to continue this collaborative process with stakeholders in order to ensure the sectors remain viable and resilient as we continue to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. That is why I feel task forces are key to this. My engagement with people across my Department brief has shown me that they want to have a say. The arts task force, chaired by Claire Duignan, met for the first time last week and is due to report on 31 October which is obviously post budget. That is why in the first meeting I attended last week I asked it to give me its key priorities before the budget so that I can use that information to feed into my negotiations. On the tourism recovery task force, that landed on my desk this week and it is key in the budget negotiations. The Government is fully aware that, given the social nature of such gatherings, tourism, arts, and culture were the sectors first affected by the pandemic and may be the last to return to normal. We must find a way to get our performers singing again and help them. Our pilot €5 million live performance support scheme assists that and has worked really well.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can assure the Deputy that my Department and I are engaging closely with the sectors and, in the context of the budget, we are very aware of the demands. Waiting for the task force report does not preclude us from taking immediate measures. For example, the live performance scheme involved an allocation of €5 million. My Department developed the conditions of the scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC. The initial closing date was 24 August and by that date more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over €15 million. The main objective of the scheme is the provision of employment for artists, creative technicians and their support. That is just one element. The task forces will also feed into the national economic plan which will come after the budget, and will in turn feed into a long-term plan. The July stimulus package was part one, and we will then have the budget and the national economic plan. Ongoing consultation and engagement is key to how we get that roadmap in place and identify the supports that are needed so that they can feed into the negotiations.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Before the Minister of State answers it would be remiss of me not to comment on Carrickmacross. When I was in primary school, which was neither today nor yesterday, I used to buy raffle tickets in the hope that we would have a swimming pool in Carrickmacross by my time in secondary school. It was Dave Phelan who championed it when I was in my secondary school days. I will keep an eye on this development. I will allow Minister of State continue now.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government published the Resilience and Recovery 2020 - 2021, the Plan for Living with COVID-19, on 15 September. This is a cross-Government approach to managing the pandemic for the coming months. This plan sets out how the balance between public health, economic and social aspects of living with Covid-19 will operate in the short to medium term. Most of the country is now at level 2, which is based on a medium-term approach to managing risk. At all times the priority will be to keep our schools open, while keeping people safe and protecting the resilience of our economy and communities. I am very aware of the impact of the pandemic on those working in the commercial events sector, not just in terms of performers but also the crews and the wide range of people it takes to put on a drama or a music performance. I have met the Events Industry Alliance and my Department is in regular contact with the representative groups. The Deputy approached me informally to make sure there was a member of the events industry on the task force. In response to the Deputy's informal request, I have put two on the task force to make sure their voices are heard. The arts and culture sectors have been severely impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; cultural venues and events were among the first to be closed in the country and they will be among the last to recover. The Arts Council is the statutory body charged with supporting and developing the arts in Ireland and has received an additional €25 million in funding in 2020. Among the measures being introduced are new and additional bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. The jobs stimulus package has specifically provided a wide range of supports across the culture and audio visual sectors. These include the €10 million pilot performance and production support package to support the live performance and the audiovisual production sector as well as a new €10 million culture fund. The recently appointed task force will prepare a report including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. With the upcoming budget and the development of the national economic plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports. The programme for Government states that that task force must feed into the national economic plan but as I said earlier, I have also asked them to give me a report outlining their key priorities ahead of the budget so that I am not waiting until 31 October. It is to ensure I get their key priorities before the budget. On 31 October, after the budget, that task force will feed into the national economic plan when they present the report.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is exactly where my focus remains because from my engagement with the stakeholders, as the Deputy stated, that is what they need. I realise the situation has deteriorated. I am also very conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenges facing live performers, promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view. I recently announced a new fund that will assist established commercial venues and promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians and creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance. An allocation of €5 million has been made under the live performance support scheme. That was a pilot scheme, which is why the amount is €5 million. It is looking at the applications and the number of applications seen helps and informs me in my negotiations on the budget because I can see how well that has been responded to. My officials engaged with the sector in designing that specific scheme because it helps de-risk the cost of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector, allow commercial organisers of live performance to commence preparations immediately and for productions to go ahead in the near future, while also complying with the protection measures. My focus is on getting these people performing again and getting technicians working again because, without them, we will not have any performances.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	From my extensive engagement with the sector, I am conscious that the changes to the PUP and employment wage subsidy scheme affect the lives of thousands of artists and other workers across the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors in a devastating way. I understand these supports are needed now more than ever to support artists in their long-awaited return to work. I have raised these matters with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of budget 2021, recognising that there will be an extended period in which we will have to live with the virus. I am aware of the difficulties this will raise, especially in the sectors in question. My focus is firmly on the survival, sustainability and recovery of this vital industry. As the Deputy stated, there are 35,000 workers, but they bring €3.5 billion to the economy. As the Taoiseach said at the Dáil on Tuesday, the Government is considering sector-specific supports to protect the livelihoods of as many people as possible. In the face of this pandemic, we have to be creative and innovative, and we have to think outside the box to support as many as possible. All suggestions should be considered and all should remain on the table. All schemes will be kept under review and no decision will be finalised until budget day.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 13 together. I am pleased to inform Deputies Boyd Barrett and Brendan Smith that earlier this month I launched a number of new music and performance schemes, totalling €6 million, to aid employment in the creative industries. The music stimulus package involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and traditional folk. Under this package, a fund of €1 million has been put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources, including live event fees. These schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases. The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and insure their work in the context of Covid restrictions. The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.  Under the live performance supports pilot scheme, a further allocation of €5 million is being made available, which aims to assist commercial venues, producers, promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in creative industries. My Department developed the conditions of this scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC. By the initial closing date, more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over €15 million. That is why it is a pilot scheme. We will engage with the stakeholders to see what would work best before we consider anything further. The Deputy will be aware that I cannot have the negotiations for the budget on the floor of the House and that that is work I will be doing with my Cabinet colleagues.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Brendan Smith will also be aware that I recently appointed the arts and culture recovery task force, which is being chaired by Clare Duignan. The membership of that task force includes representatives from the Events Industry Alliance. Taken as a starting point, the research and evidence of the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sector compiled by the Department, the Arts Council and other stakeholders, the task force will prepare a report setting out recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the pandemic.  The sector includes culture, the arts, the audio-visual industry and the live entertainment industry. The task force has already met twice. Its proceedings will be conducted in a transparent manner and all correspondence will be published in due course. I will consider the findings of the task force, as well as the experience of new schemes which were launched last month, in framing any further responses to the crisis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Both Deputies will be aware that it is not possible to anticipate the budget. I am very familiar with the pre-budget submissions of the Events Industry Alliance and everyone involved in this sector. I acknowledge the Deputies' interest in these matters and I can assure them that I will be doing my best for the sector in the budget and subsequently. For information, the total funding for the arts in Ireland this year is €338 million. That has increased by more than 30% this year. I would never have suggested - this is the reason I continually emphasise the word "pilot" - that €5 million was enough. It is a start. I come from this background myself. There are many Deputies here who have family or friends in this sector. I am acutely aware of not just the needs and livelihoods of the performers who are front and centre stage but those who enable to go on stage.  On the international comparison, I know some people look to approaches taken in other countries but it can be very difficult to make those comparisons. Population differences mean that supports are not directly comparable. We need to focus on what is in Ireland. For example, in the UK there is a very large commercial theatre sector that does not exist here to the same extent. We need to focus on the measures that are needed here. My focus will be on the report of the task force, which will consult widely to develop a clear approach which, in turn, will inform not only the budget but the national economic plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I guarantee that I do not want to lose this sector either. I am very conscious of the emerging artists. For example, we ran a programme online with Hot Press for young and emerging artists earlier this year. I also guarantee that I have never undervalued music and the arts. That is the background I come from; it is what I studied. That is where all my friends and family are. I place an immense value on the sector. It is a privilege to be the Minister with responsibility for culture and arts at this most challenging time. I have a keen eye on doing what is best for this sector, to support it not just to survive but to thrive at the other end of Covid. That is why I am engaging extensively with the sector. I have heard people's concerns and I will bring those to the negotiations, but I cannot have the negotiations on the floor of the House. However, I can guarantee my commitment to this sector and how much I value it. It is the beating heart of our nation, as far as I am concerned. It is our identity. We have to stop talking about and praising it without placing a value on it by supporting it.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim buíoch an deis seo a bheith agam chun plé a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí cultúrtha agus ealaíne. Aithníonn an Rialtas an tábhacht atá ag baint leis an gcultúr agus leis na healaíona don duine daonna, don phobal agus don tsochaí trí chéile chuile lá, chuile sheachtain agus chuile bhliain. Tá sé seo léirithe go rí-shoiléir ag an ngéarchéim Covid-19 agus cuireann sé i gcuimhne dúinn arís agus arís eile cé chomh luachmhar agus atá ár n-ealaíontóirí, ár scríbhneoirí, ár ndamhsóirí, ár n-aisteoirí agus ár bhfilí dár saolta laethúla. The Government recognises the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing the arts, live performance promoters, producers and artists, not least from a financial point of view. For the past six months, the sector has experienced devastation due to the restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The performing arts have suffered considerably in view of the fact that much of the work done by those in the sector is face to face with the public and audiences. They were among the first sectors to close and will continue to experience difficult and challenging times long after other sectors have returned to work. A particular focus of my approach and that of my Department is to engage in continuous and extensive consultation with all stakeholders, including individual artists, arts organisations, representative bodies, producers and art practices. This engagement is invaluable and has deepened my awareness of the challenges that artists, performers and organisations face, and of the important role they have played in sustaining us all in recent months. The Arts Council is the statutory body charged with supporting and developing the arts in Ireland. It is statutorily independent in its funding decisions and I, as Minister, cannot intervene in this function. The council received an initial allocation of €80 million in 2020. This has been increased by more than 30% to €105 million to allow the council to address the crisis in the sector. Among the measures introduced by the council are new and additional bursaries and commissions, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. I have a background in music and performance and am acutely aware of the challenges being faced by artists and musicians across the country as a result of this devastating pandemic. Many artists and musicians operating in the commercial sector have sought funding from the Arts Council this year. The council provides funding to professional artists in all art forms and genres.It is important to note that the council has reported that to date in 2020 a very significant proportion of its grants to individuals were made to artists who had never before received Arts Council funding. They represent people who would normally be fully employed in the commercial sector. I will turn now to the July stimulus package and give the House a description of the work which has been done over the past few months in rolling out the stimulus. In the area of culture, creativity and the arts, the stimulus is designed to create opportunities for professional artists and creatives, and their support staff, through increased support for the Arts Council, live production, live performance and specific measures targeted at musicians. A key objective of this funding is to provide enhanced support for freelance arts workers who have been impacted severely by the Covid-19 public health emergency. The stimulus announced a new €10 million culture fund to include increased funding for Creative Ireland to employ artists through the creative youth and creative communities programmes and funding to support the commissioning of artists to produce creative content for national broadcast and for Ealaín na Gaeltachta for new artists' bursaries and art activities in Gaeltacht schools.  Musicians and music performers across all genres face particular difficulties. The music stimulus package, which is part of the culture fund, is a dedicated fund of €1 million for musicians. It involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across a diverse range of genres, including rock, pop, hip-hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk. It is designed to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from their own sources, including live event fees.  The three schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support songwriting camps, recordings and album releases. The aim is to ensure Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work while Covid restrictions are in place. The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and there was an extremely strong interest in the call, which had a closing date of yesterday. Applications will now be assessed by an expert music peer panel.  The additional moneys allocated in this job stimulus package include an increase in the Arts Council 2020 allocation from €100 million to €105 million, some 40% higher than in 2019. Among other initiatives, the additional moneys allow the council to increase to 164 the number of creative schools in the 2020-21 academic year. This brings the total number of participating schools to 314 this year. It also allows for an increase in the grants to each creative school from €2,000 to €3,100. Consideration for diversity and inclusion within arts initiatives remains hugely important and all of the additional schools entering the programme have been selected from applicant DEIS schools. Some 50 of the schools starting in creative schools this year have DEIS status. A sum of €1 million in extra supports was made available to help key cultural organisations in receipt of annual funding from the Department to deal with the difficulties of operating in a Covid-19 world. These organisations house collections of movable cultural heritage of national importance or are unique in the country and relate to matters of national interest. They include Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, the Hunt Museum, Archbishop Marsh's Library, the National Print Museum and Foynes Flying Boat & Maritime Museum.  Capital funding of €6 million is available to accelerate the redevelopment and renewal of our national cultural institutions envisaged under the national development plan. Over the coming 18 months, we will seek to complete the design and planning phases of a number of these iconic buildings with a view to commencing construction in 2021. Highlights under this programme of capital investment include the reimagined and significant restoration of the National Library. The National Archives redevelopment will see our valuable trove of State archive material rehoused. Advanced design and planning works will commence at the National Concert Hall and at the Crawford Art Gallery to enhance this cornerstone building in a regenerated city plaza in Cork city. The additional capital in the July stimulus has allowed me to allocate funding to the Irish Museum of Modern Art to invest in a new collections management system, as well as to the National Concert Hall for the purchase of video infrastructure for ongoing high-quality live streaming, a particularly innovative response to the crisis. A sum of €10 million was provided for a pilot performance and production support package to support the live performance and audiovisual production sector. Of this, €5 million was allocated to a pilot live performance support scheme.  I am conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenge facing live performance promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view, and the wider impact that has on the sector's ecosystem of freelance performers, technicians and creative artists, particularly those dependent on its visibility for their income and livelihoods. It should also be noted that the live entertainment sector is worth an estimated €3.5 billion annually to the economy and employs 35,000 people. The pilot scheme is designed to assist and establish commercial promoters of live performances in music and theatre to provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The scheme will help to de-risk the cost of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performing sector, allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and allow productions to go ahead in the near future, while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed in conjunction with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. There have been a significant number of applications which are being assessed at present and allocations will made on the basis of the number of people being employed. I hope to announce the recipients of this funding in the coming weeks. The balance of the production support package was allocated to Screen Ireland, which put in place a pilot €5 million production continuation fund for film and television projects to assist production companies with the uncertainties caused by Covid-19. The fund will help to cover costs incurred where production must be halted as a result of an incident related to Covid-19 in circumstances not covered by other insurances. The maximum made available to any one production shall be €500,000. The fund will enable independent Irish production activity to return as safely as possible and help retain Ireland's talented creative workforce as the industry recovers and adapts to the challenges of Covid-19. An amount of €3 million was allocated to Screen Ireland's television drama fund to support the production of new Irish TV drama content in line with the Government's audiovisual action plan and building on the success of Screen Ireland's support of "Normal People" last year. Last week, Screen Ireland announced details of the first tranche of this funding to five television drama projects with production set to commence in Galway, Cork and Limerick by the end of 2020, as well as funding for a number of joint development initiatives with RTÉ, Virgin Media TV and TG4.  I have given the House a very brief outline of the extensive work being undertaken by my Department and its agencies in the areas of the arts. It will take me many hours to give Deputies a good understanding of the breadth and depth of interventions. Perhaps Deputies may want to point to or ask for details in particular areas and I will be happy to oblige. I will finish by alluding briefly to two task forces under way at present. These are the arts and culture recovery task force and the night-time economy task force. Their work and reports will inform the direction of Government policy for the medium term.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. I recognise that everyone who has contributed is as passionate about the arts as I am. I looked across the House during the debate and I saw so many Deputies like me who have that background. Many Deputies are steeped in a great wealth of arts and music and I recognise the real knowledge they have. I will try to respond to as many of the queries I can, given the time available to me. I am acutely aware of the difficulties facing the arts, culture, audiovisual, live entertainment and events sector. I have made it my business to meet the representative organisations across that sector to listen to their concerns and the proposals they have for alleviating the difficulties they face so that when we are designing schemes I am doing it having listened to the needs that are being pointed out to me. I have done it in consultation with them, which is key. There is no point in designing schemes unless consultation has happened with the musicians, performers and all those who work in the industry. I have had several meetings with the National Campaign for the Arts, the Event Industry Alliance, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and the national cultural institutions. Officials in my Department consult widely and continually with the sector and meet stakeholders regularly. I am aware of the issues and am committed to ensuring the Government provides appropriate supports. A number of Deputies raised the pandemic unemployment payment. I am conscious that the changes to it and to the wage subsidy scheme affect the lives of thousands of artists and workers across the arts, culture and live entertainment sector in a devastating way. I understand these supports are needed now more than ever. I have raised these matters with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of the budget, recognising that there will be a long period in which we will have to live with the virus and the difficulties that raises, especially in the arts and culture sectors. Several Deputies mentioned the live performance scheme. As I emphasised during Question Time last week, that is a pilot scheme of €5 million to see if it would work and that would inform me in my negotiations on the budget. It certainly did work because there was an enormous response to it. That scheme was developed in consultation with the sector and with EPIC. Over 100 applications have been received requesting funding amounting to over €15 million when €5 million was provided. That really strengthens my case as I negotiate for bigger and better, and what is needed. That is why it was a pilot scheme. The main objective of the scheme was the provision of employment for the artists, the creative technicians and their support staff.Deputy Cathal Crowe raised the issue of Irish dancing. As Minister, I have responsibility for both sport and the arts and my officials will examine the protocols for dancing. He also mentioned artists in the community. We have artists going into schools, which we called creative schools, and I agree with the Deputy that it is a wonderful initiative. That is why we have expanded it this year. It is a wonderful way of employing artists and letting them engage with and inspire children and young people. We have an additional 164 creative schools this year. Deputy Gannon raised the Arts Council. He is not here but he may appreciate that I am not privy to operational matters. I give him a commitment that I will get back to him if he wishes to contact me or give the details to my officials. Deputy Grealish mentioned the regional uplift. While budget 2021 is a matter for the Minister for Finance, I will take every opportunity at Cabinet to highlight the importance and value of the cultural and audiovisual sectors and the benefits of increasing investment in them. Deputy Guirke raised musicians and we are looking at a number of initiatives to support them especially. I have met members of MEAI, and my officials are in ongoing engagement with them. I assure Deputy Boyd Barrett that I am far from silent on this issue and I think my Cabinet colleagues will attest to that. We had a conversation last week about how passionate I am and I share the passion of so many Deputies who come from this background. We are fortunate to have a world-class animation sector. Due to the nature of the work, animation has largely been able to continue through the crisis by means of remote working. Earlier this year, in response to measures introduced to curb the spread of the virus live action production was suspended. This also has an impact on post-production and visual effects providers but since the end of June, this has started to recommence and I am pleased to note that within the period three productions successfully resumed and were completed. The audiovisual sector provides important employment and training opportunities and, therefore, it is of significant importance to the economy, to those working in the industry and indeed to audiences that productions return. I will definitely look into Deputy Ó Cathasaigh's suggestion to commission, record and archive. I completely agree with Deputy Ó Broin's analysis of the events industry. In particular, in my opening remarks I stated that it is worth €3.5 billion and it is very difficult for this sector which has never had to engage with Government previously. We are continuing that engagement and since he queried it, my officials did consult EPIC on the live performance scheme. Some of the arrangements of the scheme were suggested by EPIC. Regarding the points made by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, the dementia-inclusive live azure tours are delivered via Zoom and are available to people living with dementia, their families, friends and professional carers. They are provided on a scheduled, monthly basis for individuals and are bookable on demand for nursing home groups. The programme aims to make art galleries and museums around Ireland dementia-friendly spaces and the tours will be delivered in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland and promoted through the HSE Dementia: Understand Together network. We know of the love both Deputies Healy-Rae have for music as they have brought it to the gates of Leinster House to celebrate their election. As an island, we will not take one county dominating in our arts and music as all 32 counties can claim their artists, their musicians and their actors. We are a country rich in such people and every county can claim greatness when it comes to that. It is the beauty of our nation and one of the reasons we need to protect it. Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to a legacy of lip service being paid to the arts, musicians and actors. We had this debate last week and I fully agree with him on that. It is time to back that up with the supports that are needed right here and now. We have felt their value through the very tough times but it is much more than that as jobs are on the line and I am very conscious of that. As I said, there is no silence from me at the Cabinet table. I agree with Deputy O'Connor on the make-up of the task force. I have appointed arts practitioners to the task force, including musicians such Mr. Martin Hayes, Ms Denise Chaila, Ms Eleanor McEvoy and Mr. Pearse Doherty. All members will be consulted widely. I hope I have addressed all of the questions. If there are outstanding issues, Members should contact me or my officials and we will definitely follow up on them. I will conclude by referring to an interview with the assistant rector at Berlin State Opera, who is an Irishwoman. In a recent interview she was quoted as saying that the arts are seen in Ireland as a luxury whereas in Germany they are seen as a necessity. I have always believed that the arts are a necessity. During some of our darkest and longest days in the early months of the lockdown, the arts rescued many people from depression and despair. Many more of us were comforted, consoled and cheered by the inspiring performances from Irish artists, actors, singers, poets and songwriters. It is time for us to now rescue them. We cannot constantly have this one-way relationship with this community; they are much more valuable than that. They are invaluable to us and our very heritage. We need the arts like never before. Arts and culture define us as a people. They are at the heart of who we are as a nation. That relationship has to change so it is not one way. Supports are needed now not just to sustain it but to ensure it thrives. That is the determination I am bringing to this portfolio. It is the most challenging of times to be the Minister with responsibility for arts and culture but it is the right time to be here because I am acutely aware of the supports they need and I am determined to get those supports to them. Tuigeann gach duine san Rialtas go bhfuil na healaíona riachtanach agus tá sé mar dhualgas orm a chinntiú go ndéanfar beart de réir briathar ó thaobh tacaíochta de.

Táim anseo in éineacht leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, chun tábhacht an Bhille seo a léiriú do phobal na tíre i gcoitinne agus do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe. Mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as an turasóireacht, an cultúr, an ealaín, an Ghaeltacht, an spóirt agus na meáin, fáiltím roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an Dáil faoin mBille. Is onóir as cuimse domsa a bheith ceaptha mar Aire le freagracht as an nGaeltacht agus leanfaidh mé ag troid ar son na Gaeilge gach aon lá ag bord an Rialtais i dteannta leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers. Táim fíordhílis dár dteanga agus bródúil as a hoidhreacht shaibhir. Mar is eol don Teach, mar Theachta Dála le ceithre bliana anuas, déanaim iarracht i gcónaí solas a lasadh ar an nGaeilge leis an méid a deirim ar urlár na Dála agus leis an méid a dhéanaim sa saol poiblí. Bhí sé an-tábhachtach dom, mar sin, agus mé i mbun cainteanna rialtais go mbeadh gealltanais dhearfacha maidir leis an nGaeilge sa chlár Rialtais. Tá sé luaite go sonrach go bhfuil sé mar fhís againn mar Rialtas go ndéanfar an Ghaeilge a chothú agus a chur chun cinn. Tuigeann muid an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an teanga mar chéad teanga oifigiúil an Stáit, mar chuid luachmhar d'oidhreacht an oileáin seo agus, níos tábhachtaí fós, mar theanga bheo i measc pobail ar fud na tíre agus sa Ghaeltacht ach go háirithe. Tá sé mar sprioc againn cur le húsáid na teanga gach aon lá. Ar na geallúintí eile atá sa chlár Rialtais i dtaobh na Gaeilge, tá an méid seo a leanas: déanfar an Ghaeltacht, tobar na teanga, a chaomhnú agus a chosaint; cabhróimid leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus i measc an aosa óig trí ardáin a fhorbairt dóibh ar TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta, RTÉ agus Raidió Rí-Rá; cuirfimid an Ghaeilge chun cinn in áiteanna oibre agus sóisialta le cúnamh Chonradh na Gaeilge agus eagraíochtaí eile agus cuirfimid feachtas náisiúnta ar bun sna meáin mar chuid den obair seo; tacófar le TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus ardáin eile le déanamh cinnte de go dtabharfar aitheantas cuí do ról na Gaeilge; agus déanfar an scéim "Teanga Tí", scéim de chuid Ghlór na nGael, a leathnú agus bhreathnófaí ar scéimeanna eile dá leithéid a thabhairt isteach. Tá sé i gceist againn freisin ionaid Ghaeilge a fhorbairt i mBaile Átha Cliath agus ar fud na tíre. Déanfar líon na ndaltaí a bhfuil oideachas lán-Ghaeilge á chur orthu a dhúbailt laistigh de dheich mbliana, cuirfear Gaelscoileanna agus Gaelcholáistí ar fáil san áit a bhfuil éileamh láidir ar a leithéid agus bunófar ciste barr feabhais don oideachas Gaeilge. Tabharfar isteach polasaí cuimsitheach don oideachas Gaeilge ón réamhscoil go dtí na coláistí oiliúna agus cuirfear tacaíocht bhreise ar fáil don Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta. Maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, gheall muid go gcuirfeadh muid tacaíocht ar fáil do chruthú fostaíochta agus don phróiseas pleanála teanga trí dhóthain maoinithe a chur ar fáil don údarás. Tuigim go maith an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an obair atá ar bun ag an údarás ar son na Gaeltachta ar bhonn leanúnach. De bharr na hoibre seo, tá deiseanna fostaíochta agus fiontraíochta cothaithe agus cruthaithe i gceantair nach bhfaigheadh na deiseanna sin murach gur ann don eagraíocht. Cheana féin, tá ciste breise caipitil ar fiú €8 milliún é curtha ar fáil ag an Rialtas nua don údarás mar chuid de phacáiste spreagtha an Rialtais a fógraíodh i mí Iúil. Sílim go léiríonn sé seo cheana féin chomh tiomanta is atáimid do bhuiséid an údaráis a mhéadú agus gan an Rialtas nua seo ach cúpla mí ar an bhfód. Tá muid tiomanta mar Rialtas do chur i bhfeidhm an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030. Tá an próiseas pleanála teanga ag teacht faoi bhláth sa Ghaeltacht anois agus tá plean gníomhaíochta cúig-bliana don Ghaeilge á chur i bhfeidhm faoi láthair. Amárach, tá súil againn an chéad tuarascáil bhliantúil ar an bplean gníomhaíochta a fhoilsiú, rud a thabharfaidh léargas ar dhul chun cinn na straitéise. Feicfidh daoine an méid atá á dhéanamh faoi scáth na straitéise. Tugann sé seo mé go dtí an Bille teanga. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil muid anseo ag plé an Bhille seo. Cé gur fáiltíodh roimh fhoilsiú an Bhille anuraidh, bhí roinnt mhaith ag maíomh gur theastaigh Bille níos láidre, an Coimisinéir Teanga agus Conradh na Gaeilge ina measc. D'aithin an Rialtas é seo agus gealladh sa chlár Rialtais go dtabharfaí Bille níos láidre chun cinn agus go mbeadh sé achtaithe roimh dheireadh na bliana. Tá tacaíocht an Rialtais faighte anois roinnt leasuithe a mholadh a láidreoidh an Bille agus beidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, in ann na leasuithe sin a chur i láthair níos déanaí. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, is onóir mhór domsa a bheith ceaptha mar Aire a bhfuil freagracht as an nGaeltacht agam agus ba mhian liom ár dteanga dhúchais a chur chun cinn, a neartú agus a fhás ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht, ach ar fud ár n-oileáin. Chun é seo a dhéanamh, ní mór tacaíocht oifigiúil an Stáit a bheith taobh thiar di. Tuigeann muid ar fad go bhfuil stádas ar leith ag an nGaeilge i mBunreacht na hÉireann mar chéad teanga oifigiúil an Stáit. Is tríd an reachtaíocht a thugtar feidhm don stádas sin agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil an Bille seo chomh tábhachtach sin. Creidim go mbeidh muid in ann, tríd an mBille seo, timpeallacht a chruthú inar féidir feabhas a chur ar sholáthar seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge, mar is cóir, agus freastal mar is ceart ar phobal Gaeilge na tíre seo. Mar sin, molaim an Bille seo don Teach.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an Dáil faoin gcáinaisnéis agus faoin maoiniú de €1.082 milliún atá curtha ar fáil do mo Roinn. Is cinnte go bhfuilimid ag maireachtáil tríd an bpaindéim is measa le 100 bliain anuas. D'oibrigh mé go dian le mo Roinn ar an mbuiséad seo agus mé ag iarraidh a chinntiú go mbeidh maoiniú ar fáil chun daoine a choinneáil i mbun léirithe, seirbhísí turasóireachta a choinneáil beo, clubanna agus spóirt a chothabháil agus tuilleadh tacaíochta a thabhairt don Ghaeilge. I welcome the opportunity to address the Chamber in regard to the 2021 Estimates of €1.082 billion for my Department, and to provide details of the substantial measures to support and strengthen the sectors for which I have responsibility, facilitated by this increased funding. The diverse range of sectors served by my Department have been among those most severely impacted upon by the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing many hundreds of thousands across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together. They were the first to close as a result of the pandemic and they are likely to be among the last to return to full operation in the future. Our cultural institutions and theatres, our tourism destinations, pubs and restaurants, our sporting occasions and our Gaeltacht communities have all been severely hit since March. Many are shut or massively curtailed, yet these activities are the very ones which bring us all happiness and which are crucial for our physical and mental well-being. The 2021 Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives. The additional funding allocated will provide for a strong suite of significant measures as a robust and targeted response to this crisis. These measures will support resilience and recovery and ensure that Ireland can thrive once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport and linguistic heritage. These sectors, individually and cumulatively, are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas, where they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being. Well-being is a core principle underpinning the Living with Covid plan and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term. Total 2021 funding for the sectors supported by my Department includes €220.9 million for tourism services, with €55 million of this in respect of business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses. In addition, working with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, VAT relating to this sector will be reduced to 9%, which will improve the competitiveness and viability of businesses. In addition, the tourism sector will be able to avail of the cross-Government supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme and the rates waiver extension. I recently received the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023, which points to the need for urgent measures to ensure the survival of tourism businesses while at the same time sowing the seeds of recovery. Budget 2021 delivers on the immediate priorities identified by the plan, and the additional funding will help to address the immediate concern of business survival while also looking to the future, with a focus on training and digitalisation supports. Combined with the reduction in the VAT rate, the Covid restrictions support scheme for businesses that have been severely restricted by public health measures and the continued waiver of commercial rates, the package of supports for tourism is a significant response to the existential impact of Covid-19. Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2021 is €331 million. The additional funding includes a 2021 allocation of €130 million for the Arts Council, a significant increase on its initial 2020 allocation of €80 million. This acknowledges the deep challenges facing the sector as a consequence of the Covid-19 crisis, as well as recognising the critical role that arts and culture play in our society. This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations come through this crisis and play their part in the national recovery. Significant support has also been provided for live entertainment in the amount of €50 million. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment in venues across the country, building on a pilot scheme introduced as part of the July stimulus package. It will be complemented by the Covid restrictions support scheme being introduced by the Minister for Finance and, indeed, venues and ticket sales will respectively also benefit from the extended rates waiver and the VAT reduction. Some €8 million is being provided to facilitate the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall. This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling the orchestra to be established as a world-class orchestra which will, with the National Concert Hall, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. The audiovisual industry has been one of the success stories of 2020, with on-screen success in the form of “Normal People”, but also its track record in maintaining output in the face of Covid-19. I am, therefore, very pleased to be able to increase Screen Ireland's funding by €9 million to €30.1 million in 2021. Funding of €281.7 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2021 in recognition of the critical communication role of this sector during the current crisis. An additional €3.5 million is being provided to TG4 and the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, outlined already, will also have reciprocal benefits for RTÉ and is evidence of the synergies that can be brought to bear with the culture, broadcasting and media sectors now part of the same brief. I am satisfied that the increased allocation for my Department in 2021 of €1.082 billion will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes. As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to ensure that as we begin to emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, we will have a vital tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, a dynamic sports sector and media sector, and a landscape in which our language and our engagement with it can continue to grow and flourish. Tríd is tríd, is cainaisnéis thar a bheith tairbheach í an cháinaisnéis seo d'earnáil na teanga. Is céim mhór eile chun cinn í an maoiniú de €14.8 milliún sa bhreis atá á sholáthar do phobal na Geltachta agus na Gaeilge. Tá a fhios agam gur chuir eagraíochtaí éagsúla ar nós Foras na Gaeilge, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Conradh na Gaeilge fáilte roimh an mbuiséad seo inné. Tá an-suim agam agus ag an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, san earnáil seo. Táimid ag iarraidh bunsraith nua maoinithe a leagan síos don earnáil sa Roinn. Tá tuilleadh le rá ag an Aire Stáit faoin earnáil seo agus faoi earnáil an spóirt.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I am acutely aware of the devastating loss of business experienced by the coach tourism sector and the difficult environment it is working in. The impact of Covid-19 on tourism globally has been overwhelming and immediate with unprecedented consequences for Ireland's tourism and hospitality sector, including coach tourism. I fully appreciate the important role coach tourism plays as a vital component in supporting the wider tourism industry including hotels, restaurants, cafes and shops in all parts of the country. Many coach tourism operators invested heavily in their fleet in anticipation of high levels of tourism in 2020. The onset of the pandemic wiped out most of their business overnight. In this context, I was pleased to make €10 million available as part of the Government's July stimulus to assist the sector through a business continuity scheme to be administered by Fáilte Ireland. Following consultation with the Coach Tourism Transport Council, the coach tourism business continuity scheme was launched last week. The key qualifying criteria of the scheme are as follows: the scheme is targeted at coach tourism operators and must satisfy the conditions under the EU's Covid-19 state aid temporary framework; the coach tourism fleet must have been active in tourism as of 13 March 2020 and remain in the applicant's fleet at the date of application; the qualifying vehicles must be primarily used in coach tourism and have been purchased, leased or hired and registered on or after 1 July 2013; the applicant must intend to continue operating in coach tourism through 2021 with this fleet; and applicants must commit to completing and adhering to Fáilte Ireland's Covid-19 safety charter. The criteria for age restrictions of vehicles is in line with the standards set by the CTTC and tour operators. In the development of the scheme, a number of criteria were considered to define the maximum age of the vehicle. The CTTC set the maximum age of vehicles suitable to operate in coach tourism at seven years. Tour operators stipulate in their contracts for the supply of vehicles that vehicles no older than five years should be used for general leisure clients and reduced to between two and three years for corporate and incentive travel. With that in mind, in the development of the scheme, two extra years were built in to allow for exceptional circumstances which would include very high-volume periods where a five-year-old coach was not available. Budget 2021 included a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the tourism sector. The measures introduced in the budget were informed by the tourism recovery plan which was prepared by the tourism recovery task force. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by more than €59 million, or 36%, over the initial 2020 allocation in budget 2020 to €220.9 million.The funding will comprise of €179.9 million in current expenditure and €41 million in capital investment. Under budget 2021, I am providing €55 million for strategic tourism businesses to help them survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery. Combined with the Covid resilience support scheme, the VAT reduction and the rates waiver, the Government is helping to sustain the businesses that have been most severely affected by the necessary public health restrictions. In addition, investment in the tourism marketing fund has been maintained to ensure Ireland is in a position to recover quickly, when it is safe to do so, for tourists from our key markets. On the Deputy's question about the take-up of the scheme, it only launched last week. I can get my officials to look into that for the Deputy but it has not yet been open for seven days. I will follow up on it with him.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I am very aware of the difficulties being experienced by the coach tourism sector. I am mindful of their almost complete loss of earnings and am also cognisant of the very important role coach tourism plays in the tourism sector. As I said, the scheme opened last week and is being administered by Fáilte Ireland. I will revert to Fáilte Ireland and bring to its attention the concerns the Deputy has raised tonight.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The 2021 total gross funding allocated to my Department, as per the budget Estimates, amounts to €1.082 billion. This represents an increase of €79 million, or 8%, on the 2020 allocation as published in the further Revised Estimates for my Department. Those Revised Estimates included additional funding of €183 million, secured during 2020, to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 and to ensure the survival and recovery of businesses and operations in the sectors for which I have ministerial responsibility. The revised 2020 figures represented an increase of some 25% on the total comparable figure for the relevant programme areas in 2019. In broad terms, the 2021 funding for these sectors will represent an increase of 35% on what was available to them in 2019 prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our cultural institutions, theatres, tourist destinations, pubs, restaurants, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have been severely impacted since the beginning of the pandemic in March. The increased funding secured as part of budget 2021 is a testament to my commitment and that of the Government to ensure a range of robust funding streams and targeted measures are available to support resilience and recovery across these sectors, including a new €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses, €50 million in support for the live entertainment industry, record funding of €130 million for the Arts Council, €8 million to provide for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, more than €78 million allocated to the Gaeltacht and Irish language sector, €31.8 million for Údarás na Gaeltachta, €104.5 million for Sport Ireland, increased funding of €40.7 million for TG4, and additional funding for Irish language broadcasting to meet New Decade, New Approach commitments. As Minister, I am satisfied that the increase in funding to €1.082 billion secured as part of budget 2021 will support resilience and recovery across the diverse sectors for which I have responsibility and allow them to thrive once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport, language and public service media.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The 2021 total gross funding allocation to my Department, as per the Estimates, is €1.082 billion. This represents an increase of €79 million, or 8%, on the 2020 allocation, as per the Revised Estimates voted for the Department on 8 October 2020. The 2020 figures published as part of those further Revised Estimates included additional funding of €183 million, which was secured during 2020 to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 and to ensure the survival and recovery of businesses and operations in sectors for which I have responsibility. In broad terms, the 2021 funding for those sectors represents an increase of 35% on the 2019 levels. Some of the funding increases, such as the €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and the €50 million for the live entertainment industry, are exclusively directed at interventions to mitigate the impact of Covid-19. Other measures, such as the €8 million for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra and funding to support the Irish language, are not Covid related but relate to the development of sectors generally and, in the case of Údarás na Gaeltachta, recognise the Brexit-related challenges faced by its client companies.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The budget 2021 supports that we announced last month have been welcomed by all of the sectors that I represent. The Deputy has raised the question of what is Covid spending and what is in the budget on a number of occasions. A suite of funding measures, such as increased funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Sport Ireland, represent an acknowledgement of the important role these organisations play generally in supporting the sector. I know the Deputy has focused on what is Covid or non-Covid funding, but my focus is on giving support to the sectors that are struggling. There is no precise Covid-19 allocation. Rather, there is an increase in budget 2021 to reflect a mixture of supports for range of sectors which are impacted by Covid and Brexit or for which increased funding was deemed appropriate more generally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the report of the arts and culture recovery task force, which was a commitment in the programme for Government, was published this week. The report included a recommendation that a universal basic income be piloted for a three-year period in the arts sector. I very much welcome this report and thank the task force members for their time, expertise and commitment. The task force has made ten recommendations to aid the survival of the sector during Covid-19 and beyond under three themes: ensuring recovery; building resilience; and facing forward. The ten recommendations seek to protect livelihoods, which is what the universal basic income pilot involves; mitigate income loss; ensure fair play for the makers of creative content; secure the viability of the live events industry; sustain local authority capacity to support arts and culture; ensure well-being; build sectoral capacity; make space for arts and live entertainment; provide more outdoor public spaces for cultural events; and address the environmental impact of arts, culture and event activities. The task force report is extremely beneficial to the Government as we examine ways to help the arts and culture sector to emerge from this unprecedented position. I will shortly establish an oversight committee for the appraisal of the task force's recommendations.  On a broader level, the Government has already responded to the challenges facing the sector through a number of recent measures. Some €25 million was provided in June, including €20 million for the Arts Council, as well as additional supports for regional museums. A further €29 million was announced in the July stimulus, including funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, our national cultural institutions, a music stimulus and supports for live performance. Significant additional funding was announced in budget 2021, with €130 million allocated to the Arts Council for 2021 and €50 million for supports for life performance. Tens of millions of euro in supports have been provided to those impacted in the arts, culture, performance and events sector through the pandemic unemployment scheme and various wage subsidy schemes. Some people in those sectors have also availed of the commercial rates waivers and may avail of the Covid restrictions support scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can speak to the recommendations as they came from this task force, which comprised a broad range of people involved in the screen sector, the artistic community, our cultural institutions and the live event industry. They identified ten key recommendations. The Deputy said the universal basic income was a well-established proposal, long before the pandemic, and would involve a tax-free payment to residents of the State without reference to their means or availability for employment. This would be a game changer for the community which is, as the Deputy rightly said, in dire straits. We have to be prudent and do things properly. Those who have artistic or creative work as their chief occupation often experience income insecurity and cash flow problems. As the Deputy will know, financial stress can impede creativity. The creation of art, whether that is music, live events or literature, requires practitioners to have the freedom to create. I have asked my Cabinet colleagues to assess all ten recommendations. As the Deputy is aware, I led the Green Party negotiations and negotiated the commitment to the universal basic income in the programme for Government. This report will feed into the national economic plan, which is also a commitment in the programme for Government. I have started those conversations around universal basic income with my Cabinet colleagues. I welcome this report because it accelerates the commitment to a universal basic income. As the Deputy knows, a three-year pilot scheme has been sought.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. In the interim, I hope he would know that I announced the successful applicants from the €5 million pilot programme in the July stimulus package. I will roll out €50 million in the new year to help the sector. The amount was increased to €50 million because the €5 million programme received €16.5 million worth of applications. This money will support artists and those working in the live event industry. There is also unprecedented funding of €130 million for the Arts Council. We have assessed the pilot programme. I met representatives of the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland and the Event Production Industry Covid Working Group in recent weeks to assess the €5 million pilot programme and examine what more we can do to support them and whether improvements can be made. I have secured funding in budget 2021 to do that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, I established the arts and culture recovery task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the view of stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid-19 recovery and beyond. The negative impact of the crisis on the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors has been well established and quantified over recent months in research undertaken by the Arts Council and my Department. As an artist himself and from our numerous conversations about these matters, I know that Deputy Duffy is keenly aware of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 crisis on many of his friends and colleagues working in the sector. The task force has issued its report and I have brought it to the attention of my Government colleagues and arranged for its publication. Under the chairmanship of Ms Clare Duignan, the members of the task force brought together a depth of knowledge and experience. They produced their report in a matter of weeks and I am grateful to all of the members for their energy, commitment and insights. The Deputy referred to two specific recommendations in the report. The proposal for a UBI scheme is the key recommendation. There is a commitment in the programme for Government, as the Deputy noted, to request the Low Pay Commission, informed by a review of previous international pilot schemes, to examine the introduction of a pilot scheme in the lifetime of the Government. While this is a matter for the commission, once requested by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine the matter, I am personally very supportive of the proposal, which reflects the commitment set out in the programme for Government. I want to see the matter thoroughly examined in the context of the national economic plan. It will ultimately be a decision for the Low Pay Commission, but there are clear reasons that the arts and culture sectors are the right sectors for such a pilot scheme. There have been numerous trials of UBI in other countries, notably Finland, and even a recent call from 500 MPs, lords and local councillors for a trial in the UK. France has had a scheme in place since 1936 that supports artists. The second recommendation the Deputy referred to is the sectoral capacity building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers aimed at recovery and renewal through professional development. This is a measure around learning and development. The task force recommended that a dedicated bespoke scheme of supports is required. It is another proposal that I am anxious for the oversight group to examine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Under the heading Ensuring the Wellbeing of Ireland's Creative and Cultural Community, the task force report recommends the establishment of a programme to provide well-being supports to the creative sector. This is based on programmes such as Minding Creative Minds, an organisation established to offer a free 24-7 well-being and support programme for the Irish music sector. It provides access to an experienced team of trained counsellors and psychotherapists who can offer short-term intervention and advice covering practical, day-to-day issues that cause anxiety and stress. Covid-19 is bringing a lot of stress into all of our lives. Many of us rely on arts and culture to provide some relief, but those who make the art also need support. I am very supportive of this proposal and I have asked my officials to seek to progress it as soon as possible. This issue needs to be addressed promptly. Just as we miss attending live music gigs and going to theatres, our artists are really missing performing in front of audiences. The interaction between musician and audience is a key part of maintaining positive mental health for artists. They need that support and I will look to address it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The case for a UBI was well established long before Covid. As I said earlier, those who create artistic or creative work where it is their chief occupation often experience income insecurity and cash flow problems. That was the case pre-Covid and it will be so post Covid. That financial stress can impede creativity. A 2018 review of pay and conditions in the performing arts by Theatre Forum found that 30% of artists and practitioners earn less than the national minimum wage and the circumstances in 2020, of course, are worse. The Deputy referred to the programme for Government commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine that. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government. The task force has suggested that a UBI pilot scheme would cost an additional €2.5 million per annum over and above the current pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, cost per 1,000 participants. We will need to look at other UBI models, such as those in Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and California. The recommendation to undertake a pilot UBI scheme for the arts and culture community brings this debate forward. I really welcome that, as it needs to be treated with the urgency it deserves. I have started those conversations around UBI with my Cabinet colleagues. Workers in the cultural sector need ongoing support if it is to avoid depletion of talent by migration away towards other sources of income.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster for bringing forward this issue. I am acutely aware of the valuable source of reliable and trustworthy news that local radio offers in a time of uncertainty and with much disinformation in circulation. Local radio also plays an important role in bringing communities together, strengthening their bonds of solidarity and mutual support. I recognise the challenges faced by the sector due to Covid-19 and I am pleased the supports in 2020 have provided a valuable source of funding at this challenging time. During 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which is statutorily independent, held two closed rounds for radio targeted at the independent commercial and community radio sectors, respectively. In June 2020, the BAI awarded €2.5 million sound and vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of Covid-19. This was in addition to a waiver of the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for the first and second quarters of 2020, which saved the sector €1 million. I secured €839,000 in budget 2021 to compensate the BAI for this levy waiver. LMFM, which the Deputy and I are familiar with, was awarded €95,000 under round 35 and a community radio station, Dundalk FM, was awarded €16,945 under round 36. In addition, the BAI distributed €750,000 in a special round for community radio that Dundalk FM benefited from. The purpose of the sound and vision scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the ongoing challenge faced by the sector, I secured an additional €2 million in Exchequer funding for the sound and vision scheme under the July stimulus package. This has greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round for the scheme this year, round 37, bringing it to a value of €4.5 million. The BAI continues to report to me quarterly on the impact of Covid-19 on the commercial radio sector. For the Deputy's information, local radio has been included in the Government's current advertising campaign on resilience. The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have yet been made. However, the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the commercial radio sector to discuss the approach to sound and vision in the new year. I very much welcome that. That engagement needs to happen. I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how best we can support this sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am engaging closely and directly with the stakeholders in this sector. I met with representatives of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland on Monday last, 16 November. We had a productive discussion on the value of the supports the sector has received during 2020 and a follow-up meeting was held yesterday at official level. I also met with the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, on Tuesday, and my officials will continue the engagement with the NUJ. On the Deputy's question, local radio stations are in a position to avail of this round. The funding of €2 million which was secured was allocated to the fund for the latest round, round 37. This round was opened for applications on 8 September 2020, with a closing date of 7 October 2020. The BAI will make decisions on the successful applicants over the coming weeks and thereafter it will be a matter for those awarded funding under the scheme to produce the programmes being supported. The BAI will enter into contracts with successful applicants which will determine the manner in which the funds are drawn down and set out the timeline for same. If there is anything specifically that the Deputy needs information on, I can ask the BAI to engage directly with her too if that would be helpful.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In relation to the levy waiver, the BAI is statutorily independent in its functions, including the levy waiver. The Deputy indicated, and I am keenly aware from my engagement with them and the ongoing direct engagement of my officials with them, that they are in dire straits. As far as I am concerned, I am looking at all the options to support them. I have committed to that. That is why I am having that direct engagement with them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. The Deputy can let me know if she wants me to get the BAI to engage with her, if that helps. I can arrange that too.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sorry, has the Deputy changed the question? The question I have before me relates to providing grants and supports to the self-employed and sole traders. I have no problem answering questions about the task force. I only want to know whether the Deputy wants that information as well.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On supporting, what is the exact question the Deputy wants me to answer today?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a wide range of supports available to the individuals and businesses whose financial circumstances have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. The particular support depends on the institutional arrangements of the individual or organisation and whether it is a sole trader or an incorporated entity.Detailed information on all supports is provided on gov.ie and a guide to business supports booklet giving details of the key supports and resources available to help businesses is available also. Businesses may qualify for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which I launched earlier this month together with the Minister for Finance. It is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by the level 3 or higher restrictions introduced by Government. Qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advanced credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions. The scheme will operate until 31 March 2021. In budget 2021 the Government announced the provision of a support of €50 million for the live entertainment sector after a period of engagement between it and officials from my Department. It is the first time this sector has received direct support and that tells us a lot about the impact of Covid-19. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders as a follow up to the €5 million pilot scheme and I have significantly increased funding to the Arts Council in 2021 from €80 million at the beginning of the year to €130 million in 2021. Since the onset of Covid-19, the Arts Council has extended its reach and in 2020 has provided grants to many individuals and organisations. On the exact proposal or recommendation with the live events and the supports needed in the task force, I am engaging with it already on the €50 million for the live entertainment sector to see how we can improve the €5 million pilot to reach out more and support more.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am very aware there are those in the sector who cannot apply for the CRSS. We met with the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, last week and we have met with representatives from EPIC. We have asked them to consider what changes could be made to the €5 million pilot scheme. That is not just a scheme, we have seen it up and running. Last weekend saw the first events from that €5 million and there will be many more over the coming weeks and covering the Christmas period. These include pantomimes, live performances and musicians performing all across the State. I watched David Kitt play Mike the Pies on Tuesday and there are upcoming performances, including by Lisa Hannigan, Lantern events and the 4 of Us at the Spirit Store. There is a list of instances where we can see this money actually being used and providing a much-needed platform for performers. I am continuing the consultation with the sector to give careful consideration to how we can improve that €50 million on foot of the €5 million to help it, especially those who cannot access the CRSS. On the UBI, I launched that report this week, only 48 hours ago. I am going to move with the oversight committee as a matter of priority. I cannot provide a timeline immediately. I want to do this properly. We have one shot at this and I want to do it the right way. I am hoping the €50 million will provide the lifeline, as will the other supports I have given throughout the year.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Many Deputies feel passionately about the arts, as Deputy Boyd Barrett does. To clarify, it is not my report nor the Department's; this report belongs to those who work in the community, from screen producers to the live events industry to the artists and the cultural institutions. It is their report. These are their recommendations which they have brought to me. It was part of the programme for Government commitment to set up that task force, which I very quickly did, and to get the report in a very quick timeline of six weeks. The task force is to be commended on bringing it down to ten key proposals. What have I done in a number of months? I brought in the €29 million in the July stimulus, €130 million for the Arts Council in 2021 and €50 million for a live event entertainment consultation. The community this impacts welcomed this report. It can trust, given my track record in four months in this position, that I am serious about giving the support to this community which I, like many in this House, feel is an essential part of our identity as a nation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 61 together. While absolutely necessary to protect us all, the impact of the public health guidelines has been extremely challenging for the sectors supported by my Department. These sectors are integral to our society; supporting economic activity; and enhancing physical and societal well-being. The public-facing and audience-driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation in the level applicable under the Plan for Living with Covid-19, these sectors are often the hardest hit. My officials and I are acutely aware of the need to support our sectors through these challenging times and have been in regular and sustained contact with a broad range of stakeholders over the past weeks and months. In addition to bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department, a number of task forces and consultative forums have been established in relation to the particular difficulties facing these sectors. This includes the Tourism Recovery Task Force, the Tourism Hospitality Forum, the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force, and the Sports Monitoring Group. These involve a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable road maps for the recovery of these sectors. This engagement led to the very favourable outcomes achieved for these sectors in the context of the July stimulus and budget 2021. I will continue this positive engagement with the sectors and consider the views and recommendations of these task forces and consultative forums in regard to any further necessary measures or supports required as a consequence of Covid-19. That engagement is key to informing our decisions so we do the right things. The Deputy will be aware that I put in place substantial measures in budget 2021 to support and strengthen the sectors. This engagement with stakeholders has been key in providing a comprehensive response to the impact of Covid-19. In tandem with these support measures, consultative groups were established in both the sport and culture sectors to ensure the necessary guidance and supports are in place to comply with the requirements of the Government’s Plan for Living with Covid-19, including the Expert Group on the Return to Sport and the National Cultural Institutions Consultative Forum. I am also engaging with the stakeholders across the broadcasting and media sector and the Deputy would have heard me describing some of the meetings that have happened this week earlier in the debate. I note particularly the important advocacy role played by agencies under the aegis of my Department. Agencies, including the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Sport Ireland, have worked diligently with my officials to raise awareness of the challenges facing our sectors and to identify ways to support them through this pandemic. The need for important public health measures such as social distancing has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect public health. Some of the key measures that have been introduced in 2020 to help the sectors within my Department's remit include and additional €25 million for the Arts Council, a €5 million live events pilot scheme, €5 million to support the national cultural institutions, NCIs, and nationwide arts infrastructure.There is also a €5 million company stabilisation support for Gaeltacht companies, the stay and spend tax credit initiative, a €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector, a €10 million grant for coach tourism, €40 million for the three main field sport bodies, namely, the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, and a €15 million fund for sport governing bodies and clubs. The universal income supports of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme have been key to supporting all sectors throughout the crisis. The extension of both of these schemes has provided some much needed certainty.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I continue to monitor it through the ongoing engagement. It is absolutely critical to provide the correct supports, for example, the €50 million live events scheme, from which I hope some in the Deputy's constituency will benefit. We are tweaking what happened with the €5 million pilot scheme to find ways to reach those we did not reach.. We are looking to see how best we can implement the tourism recovery task force but the Deputy can already see that we have brought in a fund in the budget to provide support for strategic tourism businesses. The supports and engagement will change with the ever-changing nature of Covid and all Ministers in every Department will have to be cognisant of finding the right supports and we will continue with this engagement to inform it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely, and as a Minister I am keenly aware that we have to be ready if alarm bells ring. We are watching the situation and closely monitoring it. The officials are engaged, there is cross-departmental engagement and we will be ready to react if needs be. Hopefully this will not arise but we have to be ready.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The management of Shannon Heritage sites, including their opening arrangements, is an operational matter for Shannon Heritage and Shannon Group plc, which is a commercial State body under the aegis of the Department of Transport. As Shannon Group operates in both the aviation and tourism sectors, it has been severely impacted by Covid-19. With regard to tourism, budget 2021 included a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the tourism sector and they are supplemented by the economy-wide business supports and social welfare measures. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by more than €59 million, or 36%, over the initial 2020 allocation in budget 2020 to €220.9 million. Combined with other measures such as the Covid resilience support scheme, CRSS, and the rates waiver, the Government is helping to sustain businesses that have been most severely affected by the necessary public health restrictions. As part of the budget package of measures, €55 million has been provided for business continuity schemes for strategic tourism businesses to help them survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery. This funding will be administered by Fáilte Ireland and focused on those strategic businesses. Fáilte Ireland is currently engaging with those tourism sectors in the design of funding schemes, taking into account the effect of other horizontal funding measures, such as CRSS. The VAT rate for the sector is reduced to 9%, which will improve the competitiveness and viability of businesses. Funding of €5 million has also been provided for focused upskilling training to support business survival and recovery in the sector, and for the improvement of the digital presence and e-commerce capability of tourism businesses. Investment in the tourism marketing fund has been maintained to ensure that Ireland is in a position to recover quickly, when it is safe for tourists to return from our key markets. In response to the impacts of Covid-19, the Government has put in place a range of supports to help business and our citizens face the challenges presented by this global pandemic. I would encourage the entity responsible for the management of the sites concerned to liaise with Fáilte Ireland on what State supports might be available. Horizontal supports include the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the rates waiver, VAT warehousing and CRSS.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The tourism recovery task force undertook a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector and drew up a recovery plan containing more than 30 recommendations across a number of areas, designed to help the sector to survive and recover from the crisis out to 2023. Its short-term recommendations informed the sector-specific measures adopted in the budget. To help inform my ongoing response to the pandemic, I will shortly appoint an oversight group which will monitor the implementation of the recovery plan, as well as the recovery of the tourism sector in general.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to Shannon Heritage specifically, a commitment was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to provide funding to ensure that Bunratty Castle and Folk Park and King John's Castle, which were due to close at the end of August, could remain open until the end of 2020, subject to public health measures. It is open to Shannon Heritage to explore further the various support mechanisms now available to it, and I would encourage it to liaise with Fáilte Ireland on what State supports might be available. I know this is something the Deputy raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, earlier this week. If there is funding available from his Department, that is a matter for him, and I know he has spoken on this issue and is aware of the challenges the company faces. As part of the budget package of measures for various strategic tourism businesses, €55 million has been provided for the business continuity scheme to help businesses survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery. I would encourage Shannon Heritage to explore further the various support mechanisms now available to it from Fáilte Ireland. However, it should be noted that as a subsidiary of a State company, this may impact on its eligibility.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I point out the management of Shannon Heritage sites, including their opening arrangements, is an operational matter for Shannon Heritage and the Shannon Group, which is a commercial State body under the aegis of the Department of Transport, not the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Within my remit, I can point to the extensive supports that have been introduced economy-wide and specifically within the tourism sector to support businesses, and which Shannon Heritage can avail of. This is a very difficult time for Shannon Heritage and I am very aware of that. I will liaise with my Cabinet colleagues to see how best they will continue the engagement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster for her question. The Government is critically aware of the importance of a vibrant, diverse and independent media, which is essential to our democracy and to our cultural development. The sector is undergoing fundamental change which extends well beyond the current Covid difficulties and there are significant and complex challenges to be faced to ensure a sustainable future for our local, regional and national media. That is why the programme for Government committed to a Future of Media Commission and brought policy responsibility for media functions under the remit of my Department.  The Government has moved quickly to establish the Future of Media Commission under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith. The commission has already commenced its work and will examine all of these issues and consult widely with the sector.  I look forward to receiving the commission's report next year. In parallel to this development, I have been meeting the sector to discuss the longer-term issues impacting on its sustainability, as well as the more immediate challenges relating to Covid-19. A number of measures have already been put in place to support the sector. In addition to the general Covid supports available to all businesses such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, waived the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for quarters 1 and 2 of 2020 saving the sector €1 million, and I secured funding in budget 2021 to recoup the BAI for this waiver.  A special sound and vision funding round of €2.5 million was provided to the commercial sector over the summer months.  There was also a special sound and vision round of €750,000 for the community radio sector.  I have also provided  an additional €2 million for sound and vision under the July stimulus package.   The BAI is reporting to me quarterly on the impacts on the commercial radio sector and these reviews will help to inform what, if any, additional measures may need to be taken in that sector.  I am currently considering what further measures might be appropriate to support the sector through the Covid-19 pandemic and while task forces have been used across sectors such as tourism and culture, this would not necessarily be the most effective means to address the media sector, particularly when the Future of Media Commission has already commenced its work and is due to report within nine months.  I intend, however, to continue to engage closely with the sector to ensure that it is sustained through this challenging period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Future of Media Commission has already been established. It has met twice since its establishment. It has a strategic role in regard to the future vision, structuring and funding of media. On when it will report, it is due to report within nine months. That was announced on the date the commission was established. That is an ambitious timescale given the complexity of the issues relating to the future of media but I have full confidence in the commission under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith. My approach to this sector is to engage directly with its representatives in bodies across the sector. I met the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland representatives on Monday. We had a productive discussion on the value of the supports to the sector received through 2020 and they outlined their proposals for additional supports for the sector. I asked for the engagement to continue in recognition of the urgency of the situation and a follow-up meeting was held yesterday at official level. I met also the National Union of Journalists on Tuesday of this week and my officials will also have a follow-up meeting with them. I am undertaking to continue this close engagement to ensure the appropriate measures are put in place to support the sector through the crisis.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I am acutely aware of the significant impact that the Covid-19 crisis continues to have on the sectors my Department supports. The framework of restrictive measures is a risk management strategy designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures Government might introduce in response to the escalation of transmission of Covid-19. The priority in level 3 is to keep health services, schools and early learning and childcare services open and to minimise disruption in the workforce. To keep people safe, the public are asked to reduce the number of people they meet to a minimum and stay in their own county until 18 December. Tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sports and media activities usually involve audiences and people congregating. This is the very thing that health experts advise that we try to minimise. We need to reduce the number of people congregating across a range of settings to reduce the spread of the virus. As the Deputy will be aware, from 1 December the country has moved to a modified version of level 3 of the Government's plan for living with Covid-19. Under these restrictions, all dance and exercise classes remain suspended. However, there is provision for individual and one-to-one instruction at this level and, to clarify, this guidance applies to sport, exercise and dance. While dance studios are closed at level 3, they can provide facilities for use in individual dance practice or training. The Arts Council is in the process of preparing guidance on individual dance practice or training, which will be available early next week. In the meantime, the Sport Ireland guidance the Deputy referred to for individual training may be used. This is available on the Sport Ireland website, and measures to reduce the risk from one-to-one instruction under this guidance include staggered start and finish times, combined with appropriate entry, exit and traffic management protocols to limit the interaction of participants at any one time; pre-booking, which is essential; participants arriving ready to train and leaving immediately; no equipment sharing; and activities taking place in a predefined area that is visually marked out and directionally signed. The space required in this area should reflect the nature and intensity of the activity, and there should be in excess of 2 m social distancing between each of the predefined areas. The cleaning and ventilation of facilities should be conducted in accordance with the Government's most recent Work Safely Protocol, and instructors should refer to HSE guidance on wearing a face mask covering. While these measures mean that individual activities can take place, individual training and one-to-one instruction should not be viewed as a way of reintroducing organised dance classes, which are specifically precluded under current public health measures. However, as I said, the provision is there for individual one-to-one instruction as I have described at this level. To clarify again, this guidance applies to sport, exercise and dance. While there is understandable frustration in many sectors about the current restrictions, the focus in the run-up to Christmas is on allowing as many activities to proceed as possible while at the same time being mindful of the priority of safeguarding public health. I will continue to engage with all sectors over the coming weeks with a view to working towards the full and safe reopening of society and all individual and group activities as public health allows.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for the opportunity to provide that clarity. I acknowledge the representatives from the dance and arts community who attended the protest at Leinster House. Unfortunately, I had a scheduled meeting that prevented me from meeting the group today. I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to reopening society and the economy as soon as it is safe to do so. As I have done since becoming Minister, I will continue my ongoing engagement with the community. I appreciate the benefit that arts have on societal well-being and children's development. The Government will give further consideration to this matter in January. I believe in enabling children to express themselves through dance and other forms of physical activity. Sports are also beneficial and necessary for children's development. The focus in the run-up to Christmas is on allowing as many activities as possible to proceed while being mindful of the priority of safeguarding public health. If people continue to adhere to public health measures, the opportunities for the transmission of the virus will be minimised. By continuing to adhere to the measures diligently, we hope to be able to open up even more activities in due course.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sílim go bhfuil an Taoiseach chun cúpla focal a rá.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis na Teachtaí. Cuireann sé an-áthas orm labhairt leo anseo inniu agus muid i lár Sheachtain na Gaeilge. Tá go leor ag tarlú faoi láthair i saol na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Cuireann sé gliondar i mo chroí i gcónaí an grá atá ag pobal labhartha na Gaeilge dár dteanga dúchais a thabhairt faoi ndeara. Smaoiním ar na teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta, mar shampla, a thugann na mílte déagóirí isteach ina gcuid tithe gach uile bhliain ar mhaithe leis an teanga a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile d’fhoghlaimeoirí. Smaoiním ar an teanga álainn nádúrtha atá fós á labhairt ag na pobail Ghaeltachta seo suas is anuas chósta an iarthair, go príomha, teanga atá fós á labhairt ag óg agus aosta sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Smaoiním ar an sár-obair atá ar bun ag na comharchumainn, ag na coistí pleanála teanga agus ag na coistí áitiúla ar mhaithe lena gcuid pobal agus a dteanga dúchais a fhorbairt agus a chur chun cinn. Tugann an obair seo atá ar bun ag na pobail seo spreagadh dom mar Aire agus mé ag comhlíonadh mo chuid dualgas don teanga agus don Ghaeltacht. Tugann sé misneach dom agus mé ag díriú isteach ar na dúshláin atá roimh an nGaeilge sa sochaí chomhaimseartha. Is é ceann de na dúshlán sin an teanga a chur chun cinn ag leibhéal an Aontas Eorpaigh. In 2007, bronnadh stádas mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre san Aontas Eorpach ar an nGaeilge ach cuireadh maolú sealadach ar a húsáid in institiúidí an Aontais i bhfeidhm. In 2015, rinneadh cinneadh deireadh a chur leis an maolú i leith na Gaeilge faoi 2022. Faoi láthair tá 138 duine ag obair le Gaeilge sna hinstitiúidí Eorpacha agus tá an lá a chuirfear deireadh leis an maolú beagnach linn. Tá agus bhí dúshlán roimh na hinstitiúidí agus roimh Rialtas na hÉireann ó thaobh na hearcaíochta de le déanamh cinnte de go mbeadh líon leordhóthanach pearsanra le Gaeilge ar fáil chun na folúntais san Eoraip a líonadh. É sin ráite, bhí geallta sa Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 go n-oibreodh an Rialtas i dtreo go mbeadh go leor céimithe cáilithe ar fáil le freastal ar riachtanais earcaíochta an Aontais Eorpaigh. Dá bharr sin, tá obair shuntasach ar bun ag mo Roinn chun céimithe cáilithe a chur ar fáil le freastal ar na riachtanais earcaíochta sin. Agus an Rialtas ag tabhairt Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla tríd an Oireachtas faoi láthair, tá sé tráthúil breathnú arís ar an gcur chuige atá i bhfeidhm ar mhaithe le deireadh a chur leis an maolú san Aontas. Sílim go bhfuil go leor le foghlaim againn uaidh agus muid ag díriú ar an sprioc atá sa Bhille 20% d’earcaithe nua don státchóras anseo in Éirinn a bheith inniúil sa Ghaeilge roimh 2030. Le roinnt blianta anois, tá sraith beartas curtha ar bun ag mo Roinn le cuidiú leis an bpróiseas seo. Cuireann mo Roinn, i gcomhar leis an Roinn Oideachais agus leis an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas, maoiniú ar fáil do chúrsaí ábhartha tríú leibhéal ar mhaithe le ráta reatha i gcomórtais earcaíochta an Aontas Eorpaigh a fheabhsú agus céimithe inniúla a sholáthar d’fhostaíocht sna hinstitiúidí Eorpacha. Bunaíodh Ionad Barr Feabhais do Ghairmeacha san Aontas Eorpach chun comhordú a éascú idir na hinstitiúidí éagsúla atá rannpháirteach sa tionscnamh. Cuireann mo Roinn maoiniú ar fáil don tionscadal téarmaíochta LEX, i gcomhar le hOllscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath. Eagraíonn mo Roinn, i gcomhar le hArd-Stiúrthóireacht Aistriúcháin an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh, comórtas aistriúcháin le haghaidh meánscoileanna Gaeilge in Éirinn, Thuaidh agus Theas. I mí na Nollag, bhronn mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, na duaiseanna ar bhuaiteoirí na bliana seo caite agus bhí gach duine a raibh baint acu leis an gcomórtas an-tógtha le caighdeáin teanga na ndaltaí a ghlac páirt. Tá súil againn go dtabharfaidh an comórtas seo spreagadh do dhaltaí meánscoile smaoineamh ar na deiseanna fostaíochta atá san Eoraip dóibh siúd a bhfuil ardchaighdeán Gaeilge acu. Mar chuid den chur chuige céanna, tá mo Roinn ag maoiniú 'Gluaiseacht', seó bóthair de chuid Conradh na Gaeilge, a bhíonn ag cur os cionn 120 ceardlann ar bun le linn na bliana ar bhonn uile-Éireann. Tá go leor de na himeachtaí seo curtha ar fáil ar líne le bliain anuas, ach tá súil againn nach mbeidh sé i bhfad go dtí go mbeidh siad ar bun arís i scoileanna agus coláistí na tíre. Tá béim ar leith á cur sna ceardlanna seo ar bhuntáistí na Gaeilge agus fostaíocht á lorg ag na daltaí, le cur síos ar chúrsaí tríú leibhéil agus deiseanna fostaíochta le Gaeilge, agus ar na deiseanna san Eoraip agus, go háirithe, sa tseirbhís phoiblí in Éirinn. Tá scéim intéirneachta againn, a chuireann deichniúr intéirneach chuig na hinstitiúidí Eorpacha ar feadh tréimhsí deich mí gach uile bhliain. Tugann sé seo an deis do dhaoine óga blaiseadh a fháil den saol oibre san Eoraip, oiliúint a fháil ó na hinstitiúidí, agus cur lena gcuid scileanna chun deis níos fearr a thabhairt dóibh sna comórtais earcaíochta amach anseo. Leis na beartais seo ar fad, tá muid tar éis aghaidh a thabhairt ar na deacrachtaí a bhí ann ó thaobh easpa daoine le Gaeilge ar ardchaighdeán chun na poist san Eoraip a líonadh. Tá muid tar éis glúin nua a thraenáil le sainscileanna i gcúrsaí aistriúcháin, profléitheoireachta, ateangaireachta agus cúrsaí dlí. Tá sé seo déanta ar bhealach céimnithe, córasach, agus muid ag tarraingt ar an saineolas san earnáil tríú leibhéal. Tá muid ag dul i bhfeidhm ar dhaltaí meánscoile agus mic léinn ollscoile agus muid ag scaipeadh na nuachta faoi na deiseanna atá ar fáil leis an teanga. Sílim gur iontach an múnla é seo don méid atá le baint amach anois sa státchóras sa bhaile anseo in Éirinn.Arís, tá dúshlán mór amach romhainn má tá muid chun na spriocanna atá againn i mBille na dteangacha oifigiúla a bhaint amach. Gheall an Rialtas anuraidh go dtabharfadh muid Bille teanga níos láidre chun cinn agus tá muid á déanamh leis na leasuithe atá muid ag cur chun cinn. Tá an plé ag dul ar aghaidh ar Chéim an Choiste go fóill agus tá súil agam go mbeidh muid ag teacht ar ais ar Chéim na Tuarascála le breis leasuithe a thabharfaidh Bille an-láidir dúinn. Faoi Bhille na dteangacha oifigiúla faoi láthair, leis na leasuithe atá mé féin agus an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, ag cur chun cinn, tá coiste comhairleach reachtúil um sheirbhísí Gaeilge le bunú tráth nach déanaí ná sé mhí tar éis an Bhille a bheith achtaithe. Tá plean náisiúnta ar mhaithe le soláthar seirbhísí poiblí trí mheán na Gaeilge a mhéadú le bheith ullmhaithe agus curtha faoi bhráid an Aire tráth nach déanaí ná dhá bhliain tar éis bhunú an choiste. Tá cumhacht sa bhreis le tabhairt don Choimisinéir Teanga chun faireachán a dhéanamh ar fhorálacha in achtacháin eile a bhaineann le húsáid nó le stádas teanga oifigiúil. Tá 20% d’earcaithe nua do chomhlachtaí poiblí le bheith inniúil sa Ghaeilge tráth nach déanaí ná Nollaig 2030. Beidh sé mar chuspóir sa Bhille chomh maith go mbeidh gach oifig phoiblí atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh na comhlachtaí in ann freastal ar an éileamh ón phobal ar sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge. Ar an mbealach seo, tá sé i gceist againn tógáil, ar bhonn chéimiúil, ar líon na bhfostaithe le Gaeilge agus ag eascairt as sin, go mbeimid in ann feabhas a chur ar sholáthar seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge. Beidh taighde cuimsitheach ag teastáil chun plean náisiúnta do sheirbhísí Gaeilge a chur le chéile. Beidh smaointeoireacht agus modhanna oibre nua ag teastáil chun an plean a chur i gcríoch, chun cur le líon na ndaoine atá á n-earcú agus atá inniúil ar an Ghaeilge. Tá an saineolas agus an taithí atá faighte ag mo Roinn agus é ag plé le ceist na Gaeilge san Eoraip chun a bheith ina bhuntáiste mór leis na spriocanna seo a bhaint amach. Tá tábhacht ar leith mar sin le ról mo Roinn ar an gcoiste comhairleach atá le bunú, mar den chéad uair riamh, beidh mo Roinn i gcroílár na díospóireachta, agus ceist na hearcaíochta á plé. Leis seo, beidh muid in ann tionchar a imirt ar an gcóras, chun a chinntiú go mbeidh feabhas ag teacht ar chúrsaí earcaíochta, agus feabhas dá réir ar leibhéal agus caighdeáin na seirbhísí Ghaeilge sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Mar a dúirt an Taoiseach ag tús na díospóireachta inniu, tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach don phróiseas pleanála teanga go mbeadh seirbhísí Stáit ar fáil as Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Beidh an Rialtas ag tabhairt aghaidh air seo ar bhealach córasach, céimiúil le taighde taobh thiar de. Mar a dúirt mé agus mé ag oscailt Ard-Fheis Chonradh na Gaeilge Dé Sathairn seo caite, má táimid chun é seo a dhéanamh i gceart, glacfaidh sé ama agus ní tharlóidh sé thar oíche. Caithfear é a dhéanamh ar bhonn pleanáilte agus tá an tionscnamh atá leagtha amach sa Bhille nua ag croílár na pleanála teanga dá bharr.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Since its foundation 40 years ago, the Green Party, alongside environmental NGOs, campaigners and climate activists, has tirelessly campaigned and advocated for an ambitious and far-reaching response to the climate crisis facing our planet. This immense climate challenge requires an equally immense effort to combat what will be, if we do not act, an utterly devastating impact on our world as we know it. The Green Party entered Government with a mandate from the Irish people to tackle this challenge head-on and to implement legislation that would make Ireland a leader on the world stage in the fight against climate change. The message was clear; we need climate action now. This momentum and appetite for system change, not climate change, has been steadily building. The urgency of this crisis has united millions of people across the globe. They have marched in their droves to strike for climate, demand change and fight for their futures. We must deliver emission reductions now for our children's futures, our planet's future and our shared future. Sustained climate action requires a combined commitment and co-operation across politics and society. It cannot just be climate action. Crucially, we must also have climate justice. They are inextricably linked; the same side of the same coin. We must ensure a just transition that protects the most vulnerable in our society and ensures nobody is left behind. This will be a transition that will centre on people and their communities: where everyone can partake in a socially just society with access to housing, a strong education and stability; where we strengthen our connection with nature, build better communities and transform our society; where environmental awareness is in the mainstream and not seen as an alternative lifestyle; and where we come together to rise to this challenge with a shared purpose, while simultaneously ensuring that those who are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis are brought along with us every step of the way. The green movement is unique in that it is both on a global and an individual scale. At its core, however, it is a movement of the people for the people. The climate challenge can only be addressed if we are all working together to do so. This requires a change in the way we govern, live and work. We must educate our children through school, university and apprenticeships so they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to tackle this challenge head-on. We need system change so that it is clear, obvious, safe and cheaper to make the green choice rather than the environmentally destructive one. It is critical that we engage with people and ask how the State can best help to support them to make the green choice. The Government's consultation on the climate action plan does not just ask what we can do but how Government can best help everybody to work together to meet this challenge. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is a momentous Bill. I commend my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his work on this Bill and in bringing it before the Dáil. I commend every single official, activist, expert and campaigner who contributed to make this the vital Bill it truly is. This Bill is the culmination of years of hard work, endless campaigning and unwavering commitment by so many to protect our planet as best we can, to make it a livable and safe place for generations to come and to transform Ireland into a world leader when it comes to tackling this climate crisis. Ní neart go cur le chéile.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Circus has a long tradition in Ireland, incorporating classical or traditional circus and contemporary circus. Both strands are valued artistically, with classical circus having a long working history in Ireland, while contemporary circus practice is relatively new. The Arts Act 2003 cites circus as one of nine art forms. As an art form, circus attracts high audience numbers each year including many rural audiences and members of new communities. The live events sector has been impacted by Covid-19. I know there were some drive-in circuses last year, which shows once again the innovation of the arts sector. Government support for circus as an art form is channelled through the Arts Council. While there are enterprise supports available for businesses and individuals impacted by Covid-19, these are matters for my colleague, the Tánaiste, in his role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the criteria for their eligibility.  Primary support for the arts, including circus, is delivered through the Arts Council which is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003. Funding for the Arts Council has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a record level of €130 million this year. It is important for me to point out that under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.The strategic context for the council's support of circus and all other art forms is set out in Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy 2016-2025.  The Arts Council supports both strands of circus and, through direct support and strategic intervention, engages with the sector to assist individuals and organisations to develop high-quality performance and participatory work. Circus is supported by the Arts Council by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.  There were very significant increases in supports provided for the circus in 2020 and 2021, with over €2.2 million allocated to circus, street arts and spectacle in 2021. The council makes awards to circus organisations and to individual circus artists. In 2020, many circus artists also qualified for the council’s Covid-19 crisis response award.  Details of all grants are available on the Arts Council’s website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With respect, I have clarified about the money that the circuses have received.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There has been a steady increase in the budgetary allocation for circus, street art and spectacle over the past three years, with more than €2.2 million allocated for 2021, representing a 40% increase on the 2020 allocations. The €2.2 million expenditure in 2021 is made up of strategic funding of €1.107 million, project and programming funding of €690,000, which covers arts grants and project funding, as well as an artist support measure of €431,000, which covers bursaries and commissions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The specific circus the Deputy mentioned, Duffy's Circus, was awarded arts grant funding of €59,000 last year. Other circuses got more.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy stated categorically in this Chamber that no funding was going to circuses. I am saying that is incorrect. I have pointed out the exact money that has been given. I pointed out the exact money that the circus in question got too. If the Deputy wants, we can discuss this afterwards, but I am telling him that this is what I have. Some €2.2 million was given and the circus in question got funding of €59,000 last year.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am fully aware of the impact Covid-19 has had on tourism and hospitality nationwide and I also acknowledge that public health restrictions continue to be challenging for the tourism sector.  The national vaccination programme is critical and provides hope that in 2021 we will see the beginning of the recovery for the sector but this will not happen overnight.  For now, the focus remains on helping businesses and jobs in tourism to survive the pandemic and be ready for recovery. In line with the plan set out in The Path Ahead and after taking full account of the current status of Covid-19 in the community and the public health advice, the Government has been implementing a limited phased easing of some level 5 restrictions through the month of April.  The Government is due to make further decisions and announcements tomorrow regarding the position to apply for May and beyond, that will allow for the phased reopening of tourism and hospitality for the critical season, as the public health situation permits. While I will not pre-empt the Government's decision in this regard, I have been working closely with the sector, including meetings today, to ensure its voice is heard and perspectives understood. The tourism recovery plan was taken into consideration for budget 2021, where substantial measures were put in place to support and strengthen the tourism sector.  There was a record level of funding for tourism overall, of just under €221 million and there have been additional measures to support tourism, such as the VAT rate reduction to 9%, as well as the €55 million tourism business continuity scheme, the Covid-19 adaptation fund and other tourism sector-specific schemes. I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery. I am working on a survival, stabilisation and recovery programme for the sector.  As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government will outline how it will help people to return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  Along with my colleagues in government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism. I am also aware that Fáilte Ireland, at the appropriate time, will be launching its "Keep Discovering" campaign to inspire more people to take a break in Ireland this summer and in the shoulder season. The initial campaign will include promotions for each of the regional brand areas, including Dublin, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, and will be supported by substantial marketing campaigns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The stay and spend scheme was set up late last summer to stimulate demand for accommodation and hospitality business during the off-season. It was set up by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. It was quite an innovative approach to incentivise spending. However, the public health conditions beyond our control have clearly prevented that incentivisation of spending because of the stop and start nature of the pandemic. The unpredictability and consequences of the pandemic have resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised. A review of the stay and spend scheme was one of the recent recommendations of the tourism recovery oversight group. I have urged Cabinet colleagues to give this and other recommendations of the report serious consideration to facilitate the reopening of the sector. It is anticipated that the Minister for Finance will then take stock and look at what additional measures might be appropriate. I am cognisant of the seasonal nature of the industry, financial challenges and the leaner shoulder and off-season months. I believe that supports will need to consider that impact on the off-season. I am open to all supports that can help the tourism sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the voucher scheme, I will work with my colleagues to consider all necessary targeted measures to help reboot tourism, which we agree will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. I reiterate that I am open to considering everything and anything that will help the tourism sector to reboot. On the outdoor dining grant, we had this conversation last week. It has been very well-received by the sector. I am not hearing this cry for help from the sector that the Deputy mentioned. The grant has been well received. The applications are open. Of course, if it all dried up then we would look at it again. However, I have not received any communication from anyone in this sector who feels there is not enough money. I just want to make that point clear to the Deputy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did indeed spend a lovely holiday in west Cork with my family, where I bumped into the Deputy. It is a beautiful part of the world. The tourism sector has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it. Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector’s survival and recovery. I appreciate fully the impact in an area as dependent on tourism as beautiful west Cork. A tourism recovery task force was appointed last year to prepare a tourism recovery plan, which includes a set of recommendations on how best the domestic tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. That task force presented its plan for 2020 to 2023 to me in September last year and it has been an important input for myself and my colleagues in government in considering the measures to assist the tourism sector. Together with horizontal measures implemented to support businesses across the economy, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the sector-specific supports I have introduced have been key in helping tourism businesses to survive and employees to remain engaged in the sector.  The recovery oversight group I appointed last December is keeping me informed of progress on the implementation of the recovery plan and developments in the tourism sector more generally. As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government will also outline how it will help people return to work and further support sectors such as tourism.  We will consider more targeted measures to help with the reboot in that sector. In line with our programme for Government commitments, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.  The advent of the Covid-19 crisis meant that the work of the sustainable tourism working group was temporarily suspended but it was re-established early this year to complete its work in identifying the steps that can be taken to promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented from 2021 to 2023.  Tourism has proven itself resilient before, and I am confident that with the key support of the Government it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The focus is on supporting tourism now to ensure the sector reopens safely and as soon as possible, as the vaccination roll-out continues. There is a €55 million tourism business continuity scheme and phase 1 was announced on 1 February. In Cork, we can look at some of the benefits in respect of the supports being put in place. A wide variety of businesses in west Cork will be eligible to apply for assistance from Fáilte Ireland's tourism business continuity scheme. In response to Covid-19 as well, Fáilte Ireland, in collaboration with local authorities, established a destination recovery task force. In respect of strategic tourism locations across the country, it will bring together stakeholders to form a co-ordinated and sustained collective response. Among those responses, I am sure the Deputy will be aware of the West Cork Calling tourism network, which oversees the implementation of two destination experience development plans that are being developed for west Cork for the long term. Those visitor experience plans are the west Cork coast, including Kinsale and Ballydehob, and The Three Peninsulas - West Cork and Kerry, and it will be ensured that the plans are aligned and that tourism and hospitality providers across both geographies work together.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	From my engagement with the sector, I am acutely aware of the retention of skills being an issue. That is why we have invested money from the budget in this endeavour and that is why Government work is going on in this area. The work being done in apprenticeships by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is evident. Two such programmes launched recently in collaboration with the Irish Hotels Federation. Regarding the Deputy's concerns about approaching the winter season, that is why I am looking at more targeted approaches to support the industry during that off-peak season. We are entering the peak season for the domestic industry now, but I am concerned about that shoulder season. We should invite people to go to west Cork, like I did, in that shoulder season as well. Therefore, we are continuing the supports and we are very aware of the retention of skills issue and that is why we are investing in upskilling, training and the digitalisation of the industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and to the provision of quality and impartial information, particularly in the context of Covid-19. I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news. In terms of specific supports for the local print sector, it is of particular importance regarding media organisations to avoid any perception of undue Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am, however, cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. This is a sector which has been in decline over the last number of years and is undergoing fundamental changes due to new patterns in the consumption of media and a shift to online advertising. In recognition of these longer term challenges, the programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion. While the commission is not a representative body, the Taoiseach and I were pleased to be in a position to appoint a member of the commission who has a strong background in local print and radio. In addition, at the commission’s invitation, the representative group, Local Ireland, has participated in two panel discussions with commission members and the public as part of the commission’s series of thematic dialogues. The commission has therefore been extensively briefed on issues facing the local print sector. I look forward to receiving the commission's report in the summer. The print sector has participated in the commission’s consultations and will be part of the recommendations. The sector has suffered losses from Covid-19 and is receiving Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme. In the shorter term, the loss of advertising the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has been helped by the public health advertising placed by the Government. I understand that in the region of €4.4 million has been expended on regional print advertising form March 2020 to date.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As to the comparison with the radio sector, the Covid-19 related measures put in place for the radio sector were provided through specific funding rounds of the existing sound and vision scheme. The current scheme in place to support radio is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is independently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. There is no equivalent statutory framework for the print sector. The BAI has no function in funding the print sector. Given that the Future of Media Commission is due to report in the next few months, it is best to wait for its recommendations. My officials and I have had engagement with the sector and continue to do so. From the examinations undertaken by my officials, the sector is availing of horizontal supports to business put in place by the Government. As I have said, it has benefitted from public health advertising. I am aware that there will be more campaigns that will help the print sector. However, I want to look at what is appropriate for the long-term survival and development of the sector. I will give serious consideration to the recommendations from the future of media commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I saw a tweet recently showing the Deputy's cycling endeavours in cycling in from Clare. Fair play to him. It is the future of sustainable travel. The Government travel advisory currently in operation against all non-essential international travel, in addition to other public health restrictions, means that unfortunately there is virtually no inbound tourism at present. As a result, Tourism Ireland, the body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, has suspended the majority of its overseas marketing campaigns. Any recommencement of active marketing of Ireland overseas will be guided by the public health advice and decisions by Government on international travel.  Tourism Ireland is, however, undertaking an extensive, largely virtual, programme of activity to ensure that we are in the best possible place to immediately start converting business for tourism operators across the island of Ireland when the time is right. While we continue to face quite a bit of uncertainty, Tourism Ireland is actively planning for the restart of inbound tourism and in that regard, is developing a new business plan incorporating a three-phase approach to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand. The restart phase will involve the development of a range of immediate kick-start activities to drive demand for travel to Ireland, as soon as it is safe to do so. The rebuild phase will be rolled out as demand begins to return and will include highly visible activity in our overseas markets with the greatest potential to deliver value. Demand management will be introduced during the redesign phase, to ensure tourism has a sustainable future and meets the long-term aspirations of the industry and the country. Over the next number of years, it is likely that we will see an increase in demand for outdoor leisure experiences based on nature, such as walking, cycling and mountaineering. The Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success to date and it will continue to be extensively promoted in Tourism Ireland’s future marketing campaigns. The EuroVelo 1 route overlaps with much of the Wild Atlantic Way and incorporates many of our most popular greenways. It is therefore very much aligned with some our key tourism policy objectives, such as the promotion of more outdoor leisure experiences and increasing tourism to the regions. Both Tourism Ireland and I are very much open to leveraging the EuroVelo 1 route to promote cycling tourism in Ireland, should a suitable opportunity arise. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Indeed, that fits in with our programme for Government commitment with the development of that new national tourism policy with sustainability at its very core, which will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover. Fáilte Ireland has collaborated with Sport Ireland to identify and signpost the full EuroVelo 1 route right along the western seaboard. This work is nearing completion, with just one county left to finalise its route and erect relevant signs.  The EuroVelo 1 cycling route is part of a much wider linear route which, as the Deputy stated, starts in Norway and finishes in Donegal. Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with Sport Ireland to ensure that the route is fully signposted and will promote it on the Discover Ireland website. Fáilte Ireland's programme teams will flag it as an element of the outdoor offering in the destination experience development plan areas and towns and villages through which it passes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not know whether the Deputy has sent something in writing on his proposal to me or my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. I will discuss all proposals that are brought my way. Fáilte Ireland is collaborating with Sport Ireland in ensuring EuroVelo 1 is signposted properly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Platforms for Growth is Fáilte Ireland’s strategic approach to large-scale capital investment in tourism product, which targets investment in line with specific platforms identified as a priority for tourists on the basis of research and insights.  I understand the Deputy is asking about a project that remains under consideration following Fáilte Ireland’s first call for applications, which focused on heritage and cultural attractions and invited proposals for large-scale projects of €2.5 million upwards. In terms of the likely timeframe for completing the current stage of assessments, I am informed that Fáilte Ireland is evaluating applications which made it through to stage 3 of the five-stage overall assessment process and that decisions are due by the end of May.  At that point, projects that have successfully passed stage 3 will progress into the development phase.  Accordingly, I expect that those involved with the project referenced by the Deputy are likely to be notified of Fáilte Ireland’s decision before June. In addition to funding provided under the platforms for growth approach to large grants schemes, it should be noted that Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences across Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments.  Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Fáilte Ireland also ran an adaptation fund grants scheme aimed at assisting tourism businesses make physical adaptations to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19. All capital investment in tourism is further supported by Fáilte Ireland's current investment in complementary programme supports, including festivals and events, business supports and training, aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the regional tourism experience brands.  The overall objective is to support sustainable growth in the Irish tourism sector and drive higher revenue and job creation around Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, it is currently being assessed. To receive the funding, the successful applicant must pass all five stages of the overall assessment process, three steps in the application phase and two steps in the delivery and development phase. Stages 1 and 2 have been completed and Fáilte Ireland is currently evaluating the business case submitted under stage 3 of the five-stage process. I expect the decision to be notified before the end of June. Fáilte Ireland has provided a wide range of supports to County Cavan. The county is served by two regional brands, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands in the west of the county, where the Shannon rises and through which the Shannon river and the Shannon-Erne waterway flow, and Ireland's Ancient East in Cavan's historical east. Tourism has always played a significant part in Cavan's economy. It has a great selection of tourism assets, which I am familiar with having grown up in the nearby county of Monaghan, ranging from natural assets, including lakes, rivers, mountains and woodlands, to built heritage. Tourism development in Cavan is critical for regional development, which, in turn, has a positive effect on employment, quality of life and the attractiveness of the area for inward investment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	During my term of office, I will be seeking to achieve that realisation for the wonderful natural beauty there. Fáilte Ireland provides a range of supports to ensure Cavan benefits as much as possible from tourism across the county. It has identified the natural assets and distinctive experiences that Cavan could leverage. The eastern side of Cavan is particularly rich in heritage and cultural experience, including Castle Saunderson and the Cavan County Museum. The western part, due to its proximity to the Shannon, fits into the hidden heartlands. The destination and experience development plans and the destination resilient plans are three- to five-year local tourism development plans which identify priorities for sustainable tourism destinations. Of relevance to County Cavan, several such plans have been identified or are under way in the region.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The impact of public health measures, both domestic and international, on live performance opportunities is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.  Due to its proximity and facilitated by the common travel area, the UK has always provided opportunities for Irish artists to expand their horizons and gain experience. If the UK's planned reopening of the music and entertainment sector proceeds as intended at present, Culture Ireland hopes to resume its support to artists to travel abroad to present their work in other countries, subject to public health considerations in Ireland.  It is expected that this activity may commence later in 2021, subject to the Covid-19 emerging position and in adherence to quarantine and all other safety protocols. In 2018, Culture Ireland programming had a special focus on the UK in its GB18 initiative.  A key aim of the Culture Ireland GB18 year-long programme was to renew the unique cultural relationship which exists between Ireland and Great Britain. Culture Ireland is keen to support the presentation of Irish arts in British institutions, venues and festivals and to expand the reach of Irish culture as soon as Covid-related restrictions allow. We all aspire to a safe resumption of live performance, which is so fundamental to the arts, culture and entertainment sectors, when public health considerations permit it.  In the interim, my Department operates a range of sector-specific supports.  These include the €25 million live performance support scheme.  Applications made under this scheme are currently being assessed. I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the importance of the UK market to Irish artists and look forward to them being in a position to avail of opportunities in the UK when it is safe to do so. The Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead plan committed to the development of sectoral guidance for very large purpose-built event facilities, for example, stadia, auditoria, conference or event centres. I established the live entertainment working group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and to develop Covid-19 guidelines for the live entertainment sector.  These guidelines will be critical in preparing for the ultimate reopening of the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand there is actually much uncertainty about activity in the live entertainment sector in the UK. The organisers of Glastonbury cancelled the 2020 event and have now cancelled for a second year. Other festivals have also been cancelled, for instance, the Boomtown Fair music festival. One of the key arts and culture summer events in the UK is the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. I understand that while it will proceed in August and will use bespoke temporary outdoor pavilions in easily accessibly places throughout the city, much of the festival will actually take place online. On the Deputy's other query about skills, I understand it is an absolute fear that highly-skilled individuals will leave Ireland and relocate to the UK if the opportunities there are seen to be more attractive. Recommendation No. 7 of Life Worth Living: The Report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce proposed the establishment of a capacity-building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers, aimed at recovery and renewal through professional development. The Arts Council is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003 and is the primary support for the arts in Ireland. The Arts Council has experience and expertise in training in the sector. Screen Skills Ireland is the training division of Screen Ireland and has significant experience and expertise in the provision of training. The Arts Council and Screen Ireland collaboration will, therefore, take responsibility for the implementation of this recommendation, with the Arts Council taking the lead. I have also established that live entertainment working group with the stakeholders. Using their expertise, the guidelines available will be critical in preparing for that ultimate reopening of the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Although the UK may be ahead of us in vaccinations, we have responded with many supports. Hopefully, it is not too long before we catch up with it in terms of reopening. Rest assured, my officials and I are in engagement with the sector. That is how I started as a Minister and it is how I will continue. I am acutely aware that the sector needs time to plan, rehearse and engage audiences in advance of reopening, the lead-in time about which the Deputy spoke. I will continue to advocate for the sector to ensure it has the supports and pathways needed as we emerge from the crisis. The €25 million live performance support scheme has built on the successful pilot of that scheme in 2020. Much work also went into the allocation of €14 million to be made available in the music and entertainment business assistance scheme to help those who had not received support up until now. That is €2,500 for businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover of €20,000 to €100,000, and €5,000 for businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover in excess of €100,000. I am also liaising with the Tánaiste to look at anyone else in the events sector who needs support and who has not been reached to date.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To date, there have been two calls for applications under Platforms for Growth, Fáilte Ireland’s strategic, platform-based approach to large-scale capital investment in tourism product, as referred to in the question submitted by the Deputy, which targets investment in line with specific platforms. Under this overall programme, Fáilte Ireland aims to invest up to €150 million between 2019 and 2022 in developing major new visitor attractions of scale and greatly enhancing existing attractions. Fáilte Ireland’s first call for applications under this programme in 2019 focused on heritage and cultural attractions, and invited proposals for large-scale projects of €2.5 million upwards. As I said earlier, I am informed that Fáilte Ireland is currently evaluating applications that made it through to stage 3 of the five-stage overall assessment process and that decisions are due by the end of May. As we discussed earlier, the projects that have successfully passed stage 3 will then move into the development phase.  Fáilte Ireland cannot provide any indicative funding figures for Platforms for Growth 1 allocations until the evaluation process has been completed. The results of a second targeted call for local authorities to develop activity facility centres at waterside locations across Ireland were announced on 15 April 2021.  The €19 million investment announced for this platform will be used to develop world-class facility centres at 22 locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction. Each centre will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points. With specific regard to Exchequer funding allocations, Fáilte Ireland's overall Exchequer capital allocation this year for tourism product development is €32.8 million. Allocations for subsequent years will be the subject of the annual Estimates discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Rest assured, having grown up on the Border, it informs much of my thinking on that all-island approach. Of course, Tourism Ireland helps with that too. With regard to other capital investment priorities and capital funding schemes that are under way, funding provided under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 is targeted at helping support and grow tourism in rural communities, in line with the further redevelopment and promotion of regional tourism experience brands thereby developing the regions and rural Ireland. It is our natural asset as a tourist destination.Priority areas for tourism capital investment identified under the national development plan include the development and enhancement of tourism attractions, as well as of activity-based tourism, to provide the type and quality of experience visitors seek. There is that pent-up demand. When it is safe to do so, we will be ready to welcome visitors to our shores again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	All through that strategy is the protection of the environment and its sustainability. As we emerge from Covid, there is a huge opportunity to tap into that natural beauty we have, while protecting our environment and promoting joined-up thinking when it comes to tourism. We must tap into local attractions, cycling and walking routes, as well as local food products. That will be good for our regions and for having thriving rural communities with good employment. It makes sense to have joined-up thinking. Sustainability in tourism, as the Deputy said, is an example of that and is in that strategy. That is what we are aiming for.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Life Worth Living, the report of the arts and culture recovery task force was published in November 2020.  It made ten recommendations.  The introduction to the report suggested the establishment of a cross-sectorial implementation group to oversee and monitor the implementation of these recommendations. Several of the recommendations are in train or have already been implemented.  In particular, recommendation No. 4, securing the viability of the live events industry, recommendation No. 6, ensuring the well-being of Ireland’s creative and cultural community and recommendation No. 9, providing more outdoor public spaces for cultural events, are largely implemented. Meanwhile significant work is ongoing with recommendation No. 3, ensuring fair play for the makers of creative content; recommendation No. 7, building sectorial capacity through upskilling and professional development; recommendation No. 8, making space for arts and live entertainment to contribute to national recovery; and recommendation No. 10, addressing the environmental impact of arts, cultural and event activities. The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The task force was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits, social and economic, local and national. I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income. Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society. I have established an oversight group with the remit of addressing the recommendations of the Life Worth Living report, particularly those which are outstanding. The group's membership is drawn from Departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations. The oversight group is being chaired by my Department and includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members. They will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association. I have asked the oversight group to prioritise the examination of recommendation No. 1, a basic income for artists. This is pushing an open door with me. I have engaged with relevant Ministers and colleagues on this matter who have indicated their support for developing this proposal.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On a personal level, I have spoken of my support for and have also written about a basic income for artists. Universal basic income is also core to Green Party policy. Work is being done on this matter. It has gained the support of my colleagues in the Cabinet and the relevant Departments in the oversight group. This work on a basic income for artists is independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the programme for Government commitment to pilot a universal basic income within the Government's lifetime. I intend, therefore, to proceed with the development of proposals for a basic income for artists as a matter of priority. The sector is on its knees. People in it have heard too much talk about valuing our arts and culture and they need to see that we do. Our actions will show it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government's travel advisory currently in operation against all non-essential international travel, in addition to other public health restrictions, means that, unfortunately, there is virtually no inbound tourism at present. As a result, Tourism Ireland, the body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, has suspended the majority of its overseas marketing campaigns. Any recommencement of active marketing of Ireland overseas will be guided by the public health advice and decisions by the Government on international travel. Tourism Ireland, however, is actively working behind the scenes to keep Ireland front and centre in the minds of potential travellers. At the appropriate time, it will launch an extensive global recovery kick-start programme. In 2021, I have sustained the tourism marketing fund at previous levels to ensure Tourism Ireland has the resources to do all it can to protect our hard won market share. It is undertaking an extensive, largely virtual programme of activity to ensure that we are in the best possible place to immediately start converting business for tourism operators across the island of Ireland when the time is right. For example, the agency has just recently completed a successful virtual St. Patrick's Day programme which reached out to potential visitors right across the world. Tourism Ireland is currently developing a new business plan to reflect the global economic changes brought about by Covid-19. This plan will draw from the work of the tourism recovery task force which Deputy Griffin helped to establish. This new business plan will incorporate a three-phase approach to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand. The restart phase will involve the development of a range of immediate kick-start activities to drive demand for travel to Ireland, as soon as it is safe to welcome tourists to our shores again. The rebuild phase will be rolled out as demand begins to return. It will include highly visible activity in our overseas markets with the greatest potential to deliver value. Demand management will be introduced during the redesign phase to ensure tourism has a sustainable future and meets the long-term aspirations of the industry and the country.When the time is right to actively promote Ireland abroad as a travel destination, Tourism Ireland will then enter a market that will be extremely competitive but I am confident the agency is well-positioned to meet that challenge.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I am very much aware of the situation regarding the Yeats Society Sligo. Officials in my Department have been in regular communication with this organisation. As the Deputy has pointed out, the society has been in existence for 61 years and runs the long-standing and well-recognised annual Yeats summer school, which reaches out to students and lecturers in universities in major cities across the globe. Outside of this, the society runs a permanent Yeats exhibition, offers talks to visitors, locals and schools, and runs poetry events and creative writing and visual art classes for young and old. As the Deputy mentioned, we, and other local Deputies, met with the Yeats Society Sligo last October. I wish to acknowledge the Deputy's strong advocacy and support for the arts in Ireland, and the Yeats Society Sligo. I subsequently received a request for annual funding required by the society to meet salary and operational costs. While it is challenging to consider entering into a new annual arrangement with any cultural body until the 2022 budget is decided, I will certainly be very mindful of the request in that context. In the interim, I wish to inform the House that, in 2019, the society was awarded the maximum grant of €5,000 under the 2019 small local festival and summer schools scheme towards the annual Yeats summer school. Some 600 attendees participated across the nine-day event in 2019. No application was received from the society for this scheme in 2020. The results of the 2021 small local festival and summer schools scheme will be announced later this week, but I am happy to inform the House that, once again, the maximum grant of €5,000 will be awarded to the Yeats Society Sligo for its 2021 summer school. This is one of 28 projects awarded funding under the 2021 scheme, which has a total allocation of €96,391. In addition, prior to the meeting in October, the Yeats Society Sligo was awarded the maximum grant of €20,000 under the audience re-engagement scheme for small, regional and specialised museums, which was a once-off scheme as part of my Department's response to the Covid-19 situation. The society has also applied under stream A of my Department's cultural capital scheme for 2019 to 2022 for building upgrades and a dedicated writers' room. The results of the application process relating to this scheme will be announced in the coming weeks. On the wider matter, my Department provides annual funding to the National Library of Ireland, NLI, which houses the largest and most extensive W.B. Yeats collection anywhere in the world. The NLI also has a permanent Yeats exhibition, originally opened in 2006, which has since welcomed more than 1 million visitors. The significance and celebration of Yeats as one of the great giants of Irish and global literature is very much alive and the Department continues to have a core role in the preservation, display and dissemination of his work through institutions such as the NLI. With regard to the Yeats Society Sligo's request, I have asked officials in my Department to assess the society's submission in the context of the 2022 budget. The provision of any funding would be in the context of an agreed strategy, possibly involving the local authority and other interests, with a timeframe and performance indicators for assessment of value in due course.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I acknowledge the tremendous commitment of the many people involved in ensuring popular recognition and appreciation of the life and work of W.B. Yeats. More than any other figure, he personified the Irish cultural revival and informs our understanding of a revolutionary transformation of Ireland. The greatest among our literary figures of the age, Yeats is acknowledged in libraries, exhibitions, seminars, literary studies and monuments at home and abroad. It is of great importance that his genius be carried forward across the generations. I offer my thanks and encouragement to all of those who are engaged in the celebration and promotion of his achievement, including the Yeats Society Sligo.It is appropriate that Yeats be remembered and honoured in Sligo and that students and admirers of Yeats have the opportunity to peruse themed exhibits and visit the tranquil and beautiful area that he found so inspirational and with which I am quite familiar. I greatly respect the work of the Yeats Society over its many years of dedicated interest and hope that it will be continued. I am particularly conscious that recent times have had unprecedented challenges for its programmes since constraints on travel and gathering have been in effect. I assure the Deputy and the House of my interest in contributing to a sustainable future for the centre operated by the Yeats Society. I have asked officials in my Department to meet the society as soon as possible to explore options for the future sustainable operation of the society. I thank the Deputy for her interest in this matter.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Pilot events are necessary as proof of concept for the safe management of events while Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities and to evaluate and build confidence in the Covid-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors. The pilot events will use a range of measures to militate against Covid-19, including reduced attendances, social distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitising, contact tracing, the careful management of ingress and egress of audiences and spectators, and appropriate ventilation for indoor events. I sought these pilot events as I am determined to see a safe reopening of our live music sector as soon as possible. Neither my Department nor I had indicated an intention to use antigen testing at the Iveagh Gardens event, although I am aware that the National Concert Hall has employed antigen testing for staff and performers in the past. The Department has been monitoring pilot events internationally and is aware of the role that testing can play in supporting activities. As the Deputy will be aware, I announced today that antigen testing will be deployed for the forthcoming concert event at the Irish Museum of Modern Art on 3 July. Some 3,500 fans will be in attendance, 500 of whom will be healthcare workers. Some of Ireland's best talent will be performing on stage, talent we have all so greatly missed seeing live in this past year. It should be noted that in addition to the pilot events, from 7 June numbers permitted at organised outdoor events have increased to a maximum of 100 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 200 for outdoor stadia and venues where there is a minimum capacity of 5,000. The measures being employed will be reviewed for their appropriateness as pilot events proceed and will be adjusted as necessary and if necessary. They will allow sports, arts, culture and entertainment organisations to test necessary control measures and other measures in venues across a range of settings and have been designed to inform the safe reopening of these sectors. They will be subject to ongoing review including with respect to the prevailing public health situation. I have never been unwilling to publish the minutes of the meetings of the live entertainment working group and am happy to supply those to the Deputy, should he so wish.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are still a number of test events to take place, as outlined last month when we announced that events would take place in various indoor and outdoor venues. Today's announcement of antigen testing and reduced social distancing shows that progress is being made. The reason this was not the case with the Iveagh Gardens event was because it was the first pilot event. As the Deputy will know from his knowledge of this sector, it is not a question of switching it on overnight. These are venues that have not been in operation for over 15 months and are now working in the context of Covid-19. The first event was really about the logistics of simple things like staggered entrance and egress and social distancing. We learned from that and we are moving to 1 m social distancing. Progress is being made. We will complete the pilot events as set out a few weeks ago in the Government announcement. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that in my engagement with the sector, I am determined for it to reopen. I will, of course, have to be guided by the public health guidance at that time.We are making progress and will reopen as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think we are all in agreement that we want there to be a return to economically viable live performances as soon as possible, and there are many reasons to be optimistic. Even today, the hospitalisation and ICU numbers are very positive. I fully appreciate the lead-in times in planning and delivering events. However, I cannot give a definite timeframe for when this will happen. What I can give is my assurance that I will continue to work with colleagues in the Government and with the sector to bring certainty as soon as possible. I am fully aware that in the case of venues working at reduced capacity, while it is good to have a return to live music, it is not viable. That is why I secured in the national economic recovery plan a commitment that as long as venues are working with reduced capacity and social distancing due to restrictions, the many supports that have been rolled out will remain in place for the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The reopening of the country and the economy has been happening gradually over June and I look forward to further reopening in July and beyond. Tourism accommodation and outdoor dining, tourism attractions and activities have reopened and, subject to satisfactory progress with the health situation, more indoor activities will reopen in July.  The Government has supported businesses through the closure in particular with initiatives such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS and the Fáilte Ireland tourism business continuity scheme and is now assisting them in their reopening. While the CRSS and the tourism business continuity scheme have addressed fixed costs, the EWSS has been crucial in maintaining employment and the link between employer and employee. Its continuation was one of the key asks of the sector and the Government has committed to its maintenance until the end of 2021 in the economic recovery plan. I know the reopening is very welcome but I also know it brings a number of challenges, especially in reconnecting with employees.  Tourism brings employment to many parts of the country that have limited alternative job opportunities. That said, I am aware of the reports of difficulties in rehiring workers. After such a long period of closure it is not surprising there are difficulties restarting, especially if workers have moved location or taken up other employment. I also understand the caution some employees may feel about their safety, as well as concern about potential future closures.  That is why the Government has taken a cautious and staggered approach to reopening to, as far as possible, avoid backward steps. Thankfully, building on the high uptake in vaccination, we are still on track to deliver our plans for July and I hope this will give people confidence to return to work.  Prior to the pandemic, tourism and hospitality accounted for approximately 260,000 jobs and Fáilte Ireland was very active in the issue of skills development in the sector. The tourism recovery task force made a number of recommendations to enhance sustainable employment in the tourism sector to support both its survival and recovery. This includes the development of a national tourism education gateway as a one-stop shop to education for all tourism employees. My Department is working closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to progress these recommendations. As the Deputy may be aware, labour law and workplace conditions are a matter for my colleague, An Tánaiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not believe the PUP is a disincentive to returning to work. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has shown in its recent study that 95% of workers would be better off back at work. The PUP was an effective response to unemployment brought about the pandemic. The best way to secure the future of the industry and workers' incomes is to facilitate a safe and sustainable reopening that secures employment and income in the longer term. The tourism and hospitality sector, as the Deputy is aware, is a large employer. It is not surprising, after such a long period of closure, there are difficulties restarting, especially if workers have moved or taken up other employment. I understand the caution employees may feel about the future and their concern about potential future closures. The best way to address that is to support workers and businesses to help them get back to normal trading.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, I am aware staff retention is an issue and am delighted Fáilte Ireland is delivering on a number of strategies and is working closely with the industry, education providers and other State agencies to address the recruitment and retention challenges in the tourism sector. A recruitment for reopening webinar event was delivered on 30 April for tourism and hospitality businesses and more than 1,000 businesses registered for this event. Each business received a toolkit to support the recruitment challenges, including sourcing opportunities. A social media campaign is live for the tourism sector and is targeting jobseekers on both Facebook and Instagram. A schedule of targeted content will run through the summer on Fáilte Ireland's tourism career websites. State agencies, such as SOLAS, through the education and training boards are delivering new sector-specific support, on their skills to advance programmes in conjunction with industry, with a number of higher education institutes continuing to develop new Springboard courses and deliver additional skills. These programmes received funding as part of the human capital initiative to retain and regain qualified staff. I reiterate that labour law and workplace conditions are a matter for my colleague, An Tánaiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. He also is keen to make progress on the living wage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I understand Question No. 61 will be taken with Question No. 98, I specifically am asking for the details of the independent arts evaluation organisation tasked with carrying out the monetary and evaluation framework of Galway 2020. Tied in with that, I am asking for details of the legacy initiatives from Galway 2020. I am aware that a meeting was held as far back as November 2020 on the legacy details. Can the Minister update me on that?
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 98 together.The Audience Agency is the independent arts evaluation organisation tasked with carrying out the evaluation under the Galway 2020 monitoring and evaluation framework. The Audience Agency was awarded the contract following a competitive tender process advertised on etenders.gov.ie. The Audience Agency is a registered charity. It is funded by Arts Council England as a cultural sector support organisation. It is an experienced and internationally recognised monitoring and evaluation organisation whose mission is to enable cultural organisations to use data to increase their relevance, reach and resilience. The monitoring and evaluation framework, developed in consultation with stakeholders, including my Department, provides for a review of Galway 2020 project in terms of how it developed Galway’s cultural capacity, delivered the programme rooted in people and place; and the social and economic benefit accruing. The final monitoring and evaluation report, scheduled for delivery in quarter 4 this year, will include results on the number of cultural organisations supported, the jobs created to deliver the programme, new projects commissioned, events held, audience numbers and a breakdown of the total income and expenditure. It is not within the remit of the monitoring and evaluation framework report to carry out an audit of Galway 2020 finances. Galway 2020, as a registered company and charity, complies with all statutory and regulatory reporting requirements set out under the Companies Act 2014 and the Charities Act 2009, including the annual lodging of an audited financial statement with the Companies Registration Office and the Charities Regulator.  On the question of Galway 2020 legacy initiatives, Galway 2020 will, in the coming months, commence a focused stakeholder consultation process with creative, community, business, Government and European stakeholders. This consultation process, together with the report from the monitoring and evaluation framework, will inform the development of a sustainable strategic legacy plan for Galway 2020. This legacy plan is due to be finalised before the end of the year. The remaining €1 million from my Department's overall funding commitment of €15 million for Galway 2020 will contribute to the implementation of the legacy plan.Galway 2020 supported a wide range of local artists and cultural organisations to create, develop and deliver original works. Close to €15 million or 66% of the overall expenditure of €22 million to date by Galway 2020 on delivery of its year as European Capital of Culture has been spent on cultural programme delivery. Over 500 events employing at least 600 artists and other cultural professionals, such as producers, technicians and crew, have been delivered. Cultural project partners are in the process of completing individual post-project evaluations. Artists and cultural organisations funded included Druid Theatre, Branar children’s theatre company, Ealaín na Gaeltachta, Galway Theatre Festival, Blue Teapot Theatre Company, Galway Community Circus, Baboró children’s festival, Trish Forde, Galway Film Fleadh, Ríonach Ní Néill, NUIG Aistriú, Galway International Arts Festival, Macnas, Music for Galway, Galway Dance Project, Máirtín O’Connor, Galway UNESCO City of Film, Galway hospital trust and Galway City Museum. The data from post-project evaluations are being collated to provide comprehensive information on key project deliverables for each artist or cultural organisation, including income and expenditure, numbers employed, numbers of events held, level of audience engagement, partnerships developed, outcomes and possible legacy opportunities. This information will be used to inform the overall monitoring and evaluation framework for Galway 2020. That will be delivered in quarter 4 this year. As an indication of the level of delivery, I can advise that the seven post-project evaluations completed document that 374 artists and other culture professionals were supported to deliver 188 combined live and online performances and Galway Community Circus, as part of its projects, delivered 93 professional and 95 public training workshops.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will supply the information the Deputy seeks in relation to the extra notes. The legacy planning is a key element of all European Capitals of Culture and an important aspect, as the Deputy pointed out, of Galway 2020. Legacy planning involves taking stock of learnings from the delivery of the European Capital of Culture, incorporating the successes and building on these for the future. The Galway 2020 monitoring evaluation report and stakeholder consultation will be initiated later in the summer and will feed into the development of the strategic legacy plan. Galway 2020 is working with a number of upcoming European Capitals of Culture on initiatives, such as the inclusion of projects from Galway 2020 in their programmes, thereby creating additional opportunities for Galway 2020 artists to foster sustainability in their careers and contributing further to meeting the objectives of the European Capital of Culture programme. The performance delivery agreement between my Department and Galway 2020 was signed on 6 November 2018 and addresses the roles and responsibilities of the Department and Galway 2020 in the provision and expenditure of the grant as well as key deliverables and performance indicators attached to the drawdown of the grant. That agreement will expire on 1 July 2021. While this is under discussion, the agreement will likely be extended to year end, at least. On the Deputy's query about costs, I can get back to her. I think she may have another question. I am happy to talk to her afterwards.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of questions there. It will be difficult for me to answer them in the minute available but I am happy to provide the Deputy with all the information she wants and to be as transparent as possible. I absolutely agree about the basic income guarantee for artists. A legacy and lesson to learn from Covid and from what we missed and enjoyed in Galway 2020 will be to support the arts. On the An Post building, the redevelopment of the site is a matter for Galway City Council and An Post. The site is in the city centre and includes the city’s central post office and a number of buildings behind it that housed a former telephone exchange and now defunct sorting and storing offices. One of the vacant buildings in the complex on a laneway off the street was repurposed by the Galway International Arts Festival in 2019 and used as a temporary art gallery. A number of arts organisations participating in Galway 2020 used it for rehearsals. Under the An Post plan announced at the end of March 2021, a property developer will refurbish the existing post office, create a civic space and be free to use the rest for retail and commercial units. It is intended that, while An Post will still own the land, the redevelopment will be on a very long lease.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As part of a €50 million suite of supports for the live entertainment sector, the music and entertainment business assistance scheme opened for applications on 9 June. This scheme aims to support businesses operating solely in the live entertainment sector that do not qualify for other business supports and have been significantly impacted by Covid restrictions. This scheme will see support offered by way of three levels of once-off, flat payments: €2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of between €20,000 and €50,000 with minimum business costs of €3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021; €4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of between €50,001 and €100,000 with minimum business costs of €6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021; and €5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of €100,000 with minimum business costs of €7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021. Businesses, whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities operating exclusively within the live entertainment sector may apply. Businesses of musicians and singers of all genres are eligible to apply, as are sound engineers, lighting engineers, audio engineers, stage managers, stage technicians, sound and lighting equipment suppliers, live-streaming equipment suppliers and full-time disc jockeys. The scheme was designed to reach out and provide support for those who have not been supported to date. It should be noted that this scheme is not a horizontal income support and grants are intended to provide a contribution towards business costs. The scheme was developed in consultation with the sector and the eligibility criteria aim to strike an appropriate balance, having regard to other available supports and the need to reach as many professional musicians and crew as possible. To date, just over 300 applications have been submitted for the scheme. Of these, approximately 50 have been approved and three have been unsuccessful. All details in respect of this scheme, including guidelines and the MEBAS application portal, can be accessed on my Department's website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy and I assure him I am doing everything I possibly can. I come from this background myself and I am very much aware of the need not just for us to hear and enjoy music but for these people to get back to work. It is not just the musicians but the technicians, the crew and everyone behind the scenes. That is one of the lessons that has been learned because a light has been shone on those who work behind the scenes and how they need to be supported. The recent development has been the securing of the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery task force in that I have received agreement from my coalition partners and Cabinet agreement to pilot the basic income guarantee. We have to look to the future and place value on artists by looking at how we can support them beyond Covid. The pilot events I am rolling out at present in music are all about establishing that safe pathway back to work. As the Deputy knows, I today announced an event for 3 July, where 3,500 fans will attend, 500 of whom will be healthcare workers, and which will involve antigen testing and reduced social distancing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. The live performance support scheme is unprecedented. It shows that a sector that never had to reach out before had to reach out, and we responded with €50 million in supports, including €25 million in the live performance support scheme that was announced last week. That will supply thousands of hours of work to thousands of performers and technical staff. On the Deputy’s query in regard to when we will get singers outdoors at those licensed premises, the Deputy may be aware that I have raised with my Cabinet colleagues that those regulations be reviewed because I want to get them performing again. As many Members have said in the House, and I firmly believe it, the best support we can give to our musicians is to get them back performing again, and that is my goal.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism sector has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it. Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector’s survival and sustainable recovery. Until now, the focus has been on the survival phase. The Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023, submitted by the tourism recovery task force last year, continues to be an important consideration for me, as well as my colleagues in the Government, as we continue to evaluate additional measures to support the recovery of the sector. It has informed many of the measures introduced to date which support the tourism sector.  The sector-specific measures I have introduced, together with the horizontal supports available, have been critical for helping tourism businesses and employees through the pandemic.  There are recommendations aimed at the stabilisation and recovery phase in the recovery plan, with an emphasis on sustainability. These include the development of a suite of actions to promote the sustainable development of tourism and that these actions in turn will underpin the development of a sustainable tourism policy to be adopted by Government. A sustainable tourism working group set up under the aegis of my Department published guiding principles for sustainable tourism development at the end of 2019. An ambition in it states, "Ireland will seek to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices". Earlier this year, in order to maintain momentum on the sustainable tourism agenda, I reconvened this working group to complete the development of a set of actions that promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to a new national tourism policy being developed. I expect to receive the group's final report shortly. It will outline the steps that can be taken to promote sustainable tourism practices in the short term. Following this, I will instruct my officials to initiate the development of a new national tourism policy later in the year. This policy will mainstream sustainability, rather than having it as an additional consideration. I want the recovery in the tourism sector over the coming years to be sustainable in environmental, social and economic terms.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I encourage every Member of this House to slow down and enjoy the wonderful sights across our country, to promote staycations and to support a sector that has been ravaged due to the pandemic. Sustainable development in tourism means using, without exploitation, our cultural and other tourist resources, to preserve them for future use by future generations. This means that tourism can be a positive, as the Deputy would understand, for local communities, as well as being economically sustainable. It means longer stays and tapping into all the resources in a community during those stays. We must seek to realise Ireland's ambition to be among world leaders in sustainable tourism practices. We are well placed to be a world leader. Development of the new policy I mentioned earlier will set out the path for the coming years, which will support sustainable recovery and the subsequent regrowth. The Deputy mentioned Waterford. It has been a leader in sustainable tourism activities, especially the greenway from Dungarvan to Waterford city, which has been an exemplar for other cycle routes across the country. It is a testament to the determination and co-operation locally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sustainable low-impact activities, such as that Waterford greenway, provide a high return and show the potential to bring economic activity to local communities such as Kilmacthomas. A week ago, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 got amazing support in this House. It will establish a legally binding framework for clear targets and commitments set out in law to ensure we achieve our national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long term. Every sector needs to play its part. I am confident that our tourism sector will be a strong participant in achieving these legally binding targets. Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise the ambition that we spoke about earlier to become a world leader in sustainable tourism practices. These objectives are consistent with the EU climate ambition and the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Ireland has a reputation for being the Emerald Isle internationally. Sustaining and nurturing this real green image through the adoption of sustainable tourism practices is an important underpinning for the recovery and future tourism growth.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While the aviation sector is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of our tourism sector, the responsibility for aviation falls to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Accordingly, matters such as the closure of an airline come under the remit of his Department.  As an island nation, Ireland relies heavily on air transportation for tourism purposes. Maintaining and growing direct, competitive and convenient access to the island of Ireland is of critical importance to our tourism sector.  The air access landscape has profoundly changed since the outbreak of Covid-19 and it may be several years before air capacity returns to the levels seen in 2019. For our tourism sector, strong air and sea access links are vital. The restoration of air connectivity will be essential to restoring growth in overseas tourism to Ireland. I am keenly aware of the particular importance of regional connectivity and the importance of our regional airports to the regions they serve.  Stobart Air had the contract for operating Government-supported PSO air services on two routes between Dublin and the airports of Kerry and Donegal. The recent termination of its franchise agreement with Aer Lingus had immediate implications for both PSO services. I understand that the Department of Transport has initiated an emergency procurement process with a view to restoring air services linking Dublin with Donegal and Kerry airports.  The Minister for Transport hopes that this process will be completed by early July with a view to services recommencing by the new operator as soon as possible thereafter. The contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate in accordance with EU law.   In light of Government restrictions on travel, load factors on these routes had been very low since the onset of the pandemic.  Accordingly, the interim impact of this event on tourism in the regions of Kerry and Donegal is expected to be very small given that replacement services will be restored in the coming weeks in conjunction with the resumption of international travel on 19 July. I will continue to work closely with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and my colleagues across Government to support the restoration of direct connectivity to and within Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I wish to advise the Deputy that the organisation to which he refers has sent copies of its pre-budget submission for 2022 to me and to my officials. I am familiar with the recommendations made by the organisation. Budget 2022 will be announced on 12 October 2021. A number of the recommendations listed in the pre-budget submission that come within the remit of my Department are also contained in the arts and culture recovery task force report, Life Worth Living, published in November 2020, which outlined a vision for the arts and culture sector which I firmly support. The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual, live performance and events sectors. Other recommendations relate to increased funding to existing programmes and agencies. As part of the Economic Recovery Plan launched on 1 June 2021, the Government committed to bringing forward a proposal in response to the task force recommendation for a basic guaranteed income pilot scheme for artists. I established an oversight group with the remit of addressing the outstanding recommendations of the Life Worth Living report. The oversight group was asked to prioritise the manner in which a basic guaranteed income pilot scheme for artists could be delivered, and I am currently considering the optimal mechanism to take this important measure forward. As the Deputy will be aware, the programme for Government committed to continue to reform and improve the budgetary process to enhance Ireland’s budgetary framework. The budgetary reforms introduced in recent years, including performance budgeting and equality budgeting, are focused on providing the evidence base to support the efficient and effective delivery of services that have a positive impact on people's lives. This work is being further enhanced with the development of the well-being framework for Ireland. As we emerge from the pandemic, I am committed to supporting the long-term sustainability of the arts and culture sectors, and that remains my focus during the ongoing budget negotiations. We have a unique opportunity to achieve such sustainability in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The arts have been and continue to be among the most negatively impacted sectors, and in this context I am focused on the recovery and future of the culture sector. I can inform the Deputy that both I and my Department's officials meet regularly with representatives of the organisation to which he refers, and I am meeting them tomorrow to discuss these exact matters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I acknowledge it has been an incredibly tough time for all those who work in the arts and culture sector. Effectively, they have been unable to do what they do best, to do what they love and to earn a living. The Deputy may argue that they languish on the bottom rung, but the fact I secured a commitment from Government for a basic guaranteed income pilot scheme, which was the number one recommendation of the arts recovery task force, shows my commitment as Minister with responsibility for arts and culture. I have a vision and I understand that, by its very nature, work in this sector means there are lull periods when artists need to create, and the pilot scheme is a recognition of that. I would also point out that in 2021 I allocated a record €130 million to the Arts Council to provide for the sector. The council is the agency through which Government support for the arts sector is delivered. Building on this record allocation, increased funding for the Arts Council will be considered in the context of the budget Estimates, and negotiations are ongoing in that regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is where we are in absolute agreement. On numerous occasions in just over a year since becoming Minister, I have pointed out that my focus is not only on sustaining artists during this very difficult time. We are a nation which talks so much about valuing the arts and now is the time for us to put our money where our mouth is. If there was one lesson to be learned during the pandemic of the past 18 months, it was how the arts go to the very core of our being as a nation and I deeply value that. It will not just be words from me. That is why I fought to get that commitment in the basic income guarantee pilot because it is about the vision for beyond Covid and beyond the supports that I am putting in place. I am absolutely determined to support them beyond Covid. That is where my focus is.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My Department’s role in relation to tourism lies in the area of national tourism policy development. It does not have any role in the administration of tourism business support schemes including the setting of eligibility criteria. These are operational matters for Fáilte Ireland. In 2020 Fáilte Ireland established the Ireland-based inbound agents business continuity scheme, which has provided business continuity funding of more than €10 million to a total of 97 businesses. Last year Fáilte Ireland also established the coach tourism operators business continuity scheme, which has provided business continuity funding of just over €10 million to 1,372 coach tourism businesses. In addition to these supports, phase 1 and phase 1+ of Fáilte Ireland's 2021 tourism business continuity scheme supported hop-on hop-off tourism bus tour operators, cruise hire companies and tourism boat tour operators. Fáilte Ireland is legally precluded from providing funding to businesses in respect of tourism activity taking place outside the State. This position is set out in section 8(1)(e) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003 which states that the authority, Fáilte Ireland, shall:... support ... such enterprises and projects relating to -(i) the development of tourist traffic within or to the State, and(ii) the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services in the Stateas it considers appropriate.Accordingly, applications for funding related to tourism activity outside the State are ineligible under Fáilte Ireland's capital and business continuity schemes. Ireland is marketed as a single destination in overseas markets. Tourism Ireland, which operates on a North-South basis, does an excellent job in promoting Ireland in overseas markets, in co-operation with both Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I had first-hand experience of this recently when I supported Tourism Ireland on trade missions overseas in London and the United States. This arrangement benefits the tourism sector both here and in Northern Ireland. Many tourists who come to Ireland also include Northern Ireland as part of their trip and the opposite is also true. I am acutely conscious of the ongoing challenges faced by tourism businesses, including tour operators. Informed by the recommendations in the latest report from the recovery oversight group, and in the context of budget 2022, I am working with officials and Government colleagues to establish what further supports can be put in place for the tourism sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I do not believe it is accurate to say that Fáilte Ireland has made a decision against any specific business. The facts are that under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, Fáilte Ireland is not permitted to assist businesses in respect of activities outside the State. Accordingly, Fáilte Ireland has provided business continuity funding to businesses such as inbound tour operators and coach tour operators in respect of their activities within the State. As I have said, Tourism Ireland does a fantastic job, on a North-South basis, in promoting Ireland to the overseas market as the island of Ireland. I suggest that it may be worth bringing this up with the Deputy's colleagues to facilitate a discussion with Tourism Northern Ireland on supports for businesses, including the business the Deputy is referring to, which brings tourists to Northern Ireland. That may be an angle from which to approach it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. If the Deputy wants, she can forward the details to me of the specific business, but I do feel that the agencies are prohibited from funding these businesses because of the 2003 Act. Perhaps Tourism Northern Ireland should be approached and not Tourism Ireland, which the Deputy is aware is a separate body. Maybe this is the angle from which to approach it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To date, €14 million has been drawn down from the total commitment of €15 million from my Department to the European Capital of Culture. Of this €14 million drawn down, €13 million has been spent on the development, production and delivery of the key projects under the Galway 2020 cultural programme, most of which were set out in the original winning bid book. From the date of signing in November 2018 of the performance delivery agreement between my Department and Galway 2020, and as per the terms of the agreement, my Department has and continues to be in regular receipt of detailed information on how funding from my Department is spent. This information includes comprehensive quarterly management reports providing progress updates on all aspects of the Galway 2020 project, including the cultural programme, as well as a breakdown of project income and expenditure, which is confirmed through quarterly checks by an independent auditor. Relevant quarterly reports are reviewed by my Department as part of the controls in place in advance of the approval of funding drawdowns. Furthermore, under the terms of my approval in July 2020 of the restructured cultural programme for Galway 2020, which was developed in the wake of the impact of the pandemic on activity, my Department meets with Galway 2020 on a fortnightly basis to discuss and review project progress. Also under the terms of the approval, my Department received a monthly written report from September 2020 to April this year on all cultural programme projects supported by Department funding. This monthly report provided information on events planned and delivered, health and safety measures in place, identified risks and mitigation, communications and audience development measures. In addition, the cultural partners supported from Department funding are completing post-project evaluations with Galway 2020. These evaluations provide information on the numbers employed in each project, the number of events held, partnerships developed, audience numbers, volunteers engaged and income and expenditure. My Department receives and reviews the reports as they are completed.Finally, and as advised to the Deputy on the floor on 22 June last, the overall monitoring and evaluation programme of Galway 2020 is now at an advanced stage. The final report from this programme, scheduled for delivery before year end, will include results on the number of cultural organisations supported, the jobs created to deliver the programme, new projects commissioned, events held, audience numbers and a breakdown of the total income and expenditure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy raised a number of questions to answer in one minute. All European Capital of Culture designations carry with them a wide range of challenges in delivering on their broad objectives, and, in the case of Galway 2020, these challenges have been made more acute by the global pandemic. Nonetheless, even against this challenging background, much was achieved. Some 350 Irish-based artists and other cultural professionals completed their projects and delivered commissioned original work with more than 500 events delivered online or to live audiences. I am completely supportive of the highest levels of transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. That is why my Department continues to meet with Galway 2020 to assess outcomes as part of its ongoing monitoring role. In addition, I welcome the scrutiny that my Department's expenditure received by the Comptroller and Auditor General and note that my Department is committed to the implementation of the recommendations set out in his report. I look forward the report of the Audience Agency, which is carrying out the evaluation under the Galway 2020 monitoring evaluation framework. This excise, which will capture feedback from a wide range of stakeholders, will inform decisions on the purpose to which the remaining legacy funding will be applied. This is my principal focus at present. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the reference to 50%, in the 2014 decision by Government to exercise Ireland's right to nominate a city to be Ireland's 2020 European Capital of Culture, it was noted by Government that Exchequer funding would not exceed 50% of its overall financial costs. The €15 million in funding for the Department was subsequent included by the Government in Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework without a provision to limit percentages in respect of overall costs. Notwithstanding this, the impact of Covid-19 on Galway 2020 activity and funding resulted in significant anticipated funding not materialising. This included in excess of €1 million in local authority funding, partnership funding and box
receipts. This directly and substantially contributed to the Department funding exceeding 50% of its overall costs. My clear focus for Galway 2020 has been to maximise the potential for culture and creativity in Galway and the surrounding region. It would be unconscionable to withdraw support at a time projects had been years in development and were days, weeks or months from delivery. I am aware that the Deputy brought up other issues regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. The time has run out but I am quite happy to follow up in writing with the officials.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The published statement of strategy for 2021 to 2023 for my Department sets out the priorities for this Department over the next few years to ensure all sectors recover and grow in a manner that underpins social cohesion and supports strong, sustainable economic growth with a focus on a number of cross-cutting goals of equality, diversity, social inclusion, the Irish language and environmental sustainability. One of the cross-cutting goals of the strategy is to support and promote diversity, social, inclusion and full and effective female participation across my Department’s sectors and society in line with programme for Government commitments. Access to participation in arts and culture is one of the cornerstones of the national framework cultural policy. Culture 2025 underpins the right of everyone to participate in the cultural and creative life of the nation. My Department works with the Council of the National Cultural Institutions to encourage the development of universal audience access, including access for new communities, people with disabilities, the Traveller community and the LGBT+ communities. The Arts Council of Ireland is the Government agency with responsibility for the arts and artists. Under the Arts Act 2003, the council provides primary responsibility for the promotion and support of the arts throughout the country. The council’s equality, human rights and diversity, EHRD, policy and strategy is designed to build on a range of existing Arts Council work areas. The council is committed to promoting and enhancing inclusion, diversity and equality. It funds key arts organisations that have a central role in supporting these areas of work. These awards and schemes operated by the council are informed by the Arts Council‘s EHRD policy and strategy and the paying the artist policy. Diversity is a core organisational value in the Arts Council’s ten-year strategy. The council encourages board membership with knowledge of matters relating to diversity, equality and inclusion. Screen Ireland is also committed to developing policies in these areas and plans to publish its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2022. My Department is working to achieve better gender balance and more diversity across membership of all the boards of the national cultural institutions and agencies under its remit.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My Department is developing a number of policies to support diversity and full and effective female presentation and engagement. I would point the Deputy to the Creative Ireland programme. There have been a number of initiatives that encourage diversity within the arts, for example, to facilitate the integration of migrant populations.Songs from Direct Provision in south County Dublin; Song Seeking initiatives in Limerick; a film project called "Under Surveillance" in County Wicklow and a children's art exhibition in Tramore library are just some examples of projects that provide creative opportunities for people living in direct provision. The programme promotes the inclusion and participation of Travellers and Roma. For example, Cork community arts link is working collaboratively with the Travellers' visibility group on a large street art project for its premises. The project Crown - hair and identity in Traveller Culture
from Mayo County Council wonderfully explores the subject of hair with Irish Traveller women as a powerful symbol of individuality and one which is intrinsically linked to identity, ethnicity, culture and gender. I refer to the programme which supports people with disabilities, Le Chéile. The Open Youth Orchestra of Ireland is a cross-Border ensemble made up exclusively of musicians of with disabilities, including Down's Syndrome, autism and cerebral palsy. It was developed by the Royal Irish Academy of Music with Creative Ireland funding. It is the first open national youth orchestra in the world. There are quite a number of initiatives. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am stuck for words, which is a first. I thank Deputy Lahart. I will not sing it now. In response to Deputy Devlin, due to my background teaching in DEIS schools, I have asked for more DEIS schools to be included in creative schools. Another great initiative is the fighting words creative writing programme, of which the Deputy is probably aware, that works with children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Deputy Lahart is probably aware of the local authority scheme for those creative spaces launched by my Department during the summer. Front and centre is finding those places for those interested in the arts to have easy, accessible spaces to perform.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 49 and 63 together. I am critically aware of the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on all areas of the arts and cultural sector and have endeavoured to make sure the concerns of those in this sector have been understood and addressed. I have met with numerous representative organisations and officials in my Department have continued contact with these organisations and others on a regular basis, throughout the pandemic, to confirm I had the most up-to-date information to ensure appropriate supports were delivered for the sector. This includes stakeholder forums in August and September where I spoke directly to a wide range of stakeholders and heard their concerns. With regard to the basic income guarantee pilot, the arts and culture recovery task force report, Life Worth Living, was published in November 2020 and made ten recommendations for the sector. These recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audio-visual and live performance and events sectors. The delivery of this pilot will be key to underpinning the recovery in the arts and culture sector and will provide much-needed certainty to the artists and creatives who choose to avail of the pilot scheme. The Life Worth Living report describes a basic income as an unconditional State payment each citizen receives - in this instance, for the arts and cultural sector. The introduction of such a basic income pilot would create a more stable social protection mechanism to allow artists and workers to sustain themselves during the pandemic. It should keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing social and economic, local and national benefits. I fully agree the arts sector represents a very appropriate area for a basic income guarantee scheme for many reasons, including that it is often being characterised by low and precarious income; it includes a broad mix of employment types; and it has been chosen for basic income pilots in other jurisdictions, allowing for international comparisons to be drawn. I was delighted that as part of the national economic recovery plan, I secured a commitment from Government to prioritise the development of a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value this sector brings to all citizens, which was especially evident during the pandemic. The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated in its impact both internationally and at home. The Government recognises that bold steps are necessary for our much-treasured arts, events and cultural community to come back stronger than ever before. I established the oversight group in June to appraise the recommendations in the Life Worth Living
report. Although the remit of the oversight group included the examination of all recommendations in the report, I asked they prioritise the consideration of the recommendation of a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for artists and arts workers. The oversight group is chaired by my Department and joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance; Social Protection; Housing, Local Government and Heritage; Public Expenditure and Reform; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members, alongside a representative of the County and City Management Association. The oversight group has met eight times over the past four months to discuss the basic income recommendation, alongside the other nine recommendations. To assist in these discussions, the oversight group established a subcommittee to focus solely on the progression of the recommendation for the basic income pilot scheme. This subcommittee met nine times over the summer months to develop a number of options that could fulfil the requirements of a pilot scheme as set out in the Life Worth Living report. The oversight group, with the research carried out by this subcommittee, has provided me with a preliminary report on the different options for a three-year pilot scheme, which I am currently considering. A number of organisations have given presentations to the oversight committee to inform its considerations. These include the National Campaign for the Arts; Social Justice Ireland; Praxis, the artists' union; Dr. Stephen Kinsella, economist in University Limerick; and Dr. Niamh NicGhabhann and Dr. Annmarie Ryan, who have done research in the area of artist basic income. In addition, Equity, the actors' union is due to present to the group next week. The objectives of the pilot scheme will include: minimising the ongoing loss of skills in the arts sector with regard both to artists and arts workers; contributing to the sector's post-pandemic recovery with ongoing social, economic, local and national benefits; and enabling artists to focus on their practice without having to enter into employment in other sectors to sustain themselves. It is particularly important for this pilot scheme to also address the well-being of those in the arts and cultural sector, and to stimulate the arts sector’s recovery post-pandemic. I will be providing further detail on how this pilot scheme will operate in the near future as part of the discussions around budget 2022. Significant stakeholder engagement will take place in the coming weeks between my Department and those in the sector to ensure this pilot meets the needs of the sector alongside the objectives agreed by the oversight group. I envision that this pilot should launch in early 2022 and I believe it will bring new life and support to the arts and cultural sector, after the difficult circumstances it has endured over the last year and a half.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe that with this pilot and this commitment and by delivering the number one recommendation, we as a country have an opportunity to lead. In earlier questions I mentioned how we really value and the arts. I see this opportunity, so I am grabbing it. That is why we had so many meetings over the summer. The pilot scheme we are working on relates to the commitment in the National Economic Recovery Plan 2021. That is what I am committed to. There may have been confusion in the wording in the Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025. As the Deputy said, the Department of Social Protection is on the oversight group. I am working on what was sought in its task force report last year. On the timeframe, I said early 2022. If I could have done it yesterday, I would have done it, but it will take time. I am aiming for 1 January 2022, but I do not know if it will be that date. However, it will be as early as possible. I am committed to that. As soon as it can be done, we will do it. We are doing something different and unprecedented, so I want to make sure that we do it properly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can confirm that I am looking at the recommendation in the task force report from last year. The oversight group presented a number of options to me. I will make my decision based on the option that I think is best for the arts sector. I cannot give any more detail than that. The Deputy will appreciate that this information is sensitive. It is also part of the budget negotiations. With the greatest of respect, I ask the Deputy to give me some time. It is at a crucial stage. On the Deputy's question on the date, I did not give a specific date, because I cannot give one. All I can say is that the desire is there for it to be as early as possible in the new year. However, I must have everything over the line with the budget negotiations. I need to consult with the sector to make sure that it is happy with the decision I take on the options the oversight group has presented to me. To me, engagement is key here. It is how I operate as a Minister. Therefore, I will not just decide, but I will go back to the sector to engage with it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are two major areas of work taking place under the remit of my Department in regard to arts in the context of the child, through the Arts Council and the Creative Ireland Programme. Children and young people participate in the arts in early learning and care settings, schools, and other education and youth work settings. These opportunities may be offered in partnership with independent and community providers. Other activities are offered outside mainstream education or youth work settings and are led by artists, specialist teachers and facilitators working in a range of organisations and community settings. The Arts Council recognises the value of arts and cultural participation among children and young people and acknowledges their fundamental right to participate in the arts. The council supports and promotes children's and young people’s engagement with the arts from birth to early adulthood. The Arts Council considers opportunities for children to learn and develop artistic skills, and to experience the arts, as being essential to realising their rights as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Through the Creative Ireland programme, my Department continues to support community-based measures to increase and expand the opportunities for children and young people to access arts and culture-based creative activities. As part of the ongoing implementation of the Creative Youth plan, a number of measures and initiatives have been developed and delivered which have enabled increased access to a wide range of creative activities, including the arts. Key in this regard has been the establishment of Cruinniú na nÓg, the annual day of free creative activities for children and young people under 18 years of age. Cruinniú na nÓg is funded by my Department and delivered by all 31 local authorities. On Saturday, 12 June last, my Department’s support enabled more than 630 events and activities to take place throughout the country. As society begins to reopen, it is important to ensure children and young people continue to have opportunities to take part in and access a range of art activities through which they can express and enjoy themselves and develop their skills. For this reason, I will continue the important work of Creative Ireland in relation to the Creative Youth plan, and I look forward to continuing engagement with the Arts Council in its strategies to ensure ongoing engagement by children with the arts.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Creative Youth plan to enable the creative potential of every young person was published in December 2017 as one of the five pillars of the Creative Ireland programme. One of the key measures taken to support young people's engagement at community level has been the establishment of Cruinniú na nÓg, as I mentioned earlier. It is the day when every young person in Ireland can experience something new and exciting and something to spark and nurture their creative skills. As with many other events and activities, unfortunately, the necessary public health measures meant that we had to shift much of the programme online and undertake it virtually. However, the engagement was still happening and that was the key point. It ensured that every child in Ireland had access to Cruinniú na nÓg activities and also enabled us to reach children in the Irish diaspora. It was interesting that what happened during Covid-19, therefore, was the broadening out of such activities. Moving to creative schools, and similar to the response to a previous question asked by the Deputy, over the last year and a half I have sought to ensure that initiatives such as the Creative Schools programme place a particular focus on supporting young people at risk of marginalisation. To that end, I provided resources last year to enable the Arts Council to increase capacity within creative schools with additional places, 10% of the total, all of which were targeted at DEIS schools. I will be making an announcement tomorrow with my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, about new schools entering the Creative Schools programme from May 2023. There is a policy, therefore, of providing more access at all times to the arts for more children.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The local authorities have an extensive track record of community engagement through the arts, culture, heritage and library services. The Deputy is aware of this aspect as we both served on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. These services are fundamental to developing a stronger society. Through the Creative Ireland programme and in partnership with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, my Department has supported each of the 31 local authorities to develop and implement individual cultural and creative strategies. These strategies are designed to engage local communities. Within the 31 local authorities, priorities around programmes for children and young people exist in more than 75% of their culture and creative strategies. Good progress is being made in that direction, therefore. I also point the Deputy in the direction of the pilot local Creative Youth partnerships that have been established in conjunction with six education and training boards. Those seek to develop closer local networking and to provide more opportunities for young people to engage with creative activities outside of school and especially those who are most disadvantaged. The Creative Ireland national music education programme, Music Generation, is expanding to the remaining areas where music education partnerships have not yet been established. This amounts to nine new partnerships being established. Five have already been set up in Kerry, Kildare, Meath, Longford and Tipperary and one is being established in Fingal in 2021. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The report of the night-time economy task force was launched in recent days. I and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, emphasised that it was not all about alcohol. I thought that was key to it. There were offerings regarding cultural institutions and spaces for events to happen without alcohol. It is a key element of the approach that we do not associate the night-time economy solely with alcohol. There was a lot of engagement with the HSE in the preparation of the report. Multiple events can be considered in the context of the night-time economy task force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A key part of the report, as emphasised at the launch, was to place a value on electronic music and the club culture as part of the arts and culture sector, which has never been done before. There is also ample opportunity to ensure cultural activities do not stop when it gets dark. That does not mean all cultural activities must involve alcohol. We will be looking to have family-friendly activities. I would like to be in a position to take my children to events at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. and 12 midnight, if they want to engage in them. I see huge potential in this regard. As Deputy Gould says, we must engage with the HSE and addiction services. That engagement has been happening and will be ongoing. As the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and I said at the time, there is potential in this area. I do not think the focus for the night-time economy should be on alcohol, as that would be unnecessarily negative. This is a positive development in the extension of the night-time culture and all that it offers to everyone.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I see massive potential for a broad range of events for everyone, as the night-time economy belongs to all people. I am open to suggestions. There is potential for consultation with the cultural advisers that are mentioned in the report on the events to which Deputy Gould refers. As it is, great work is being done by the cultural institutions and theatres. As outlined in the report, there will be pilot events in cultural institutions late at night and some family-focused events.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá áthas orm labhairt leis na Teachtaí, maraon leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Naughton, faoi théarnamh ár n-éarnálacha turasóireachta agus eitlíóchta, dhá earnáil a bhfuil dlúthnasc eatarthu. I am pleased to have the opportunity, along with the Minister of State to address the House on the recovery and reopening of our tourism and aviation sectors, two sectors with close links. The past 18 months have been incredibly difficult for everyone working in the tourism industry. However, as our economy and society have reopened over the last few months and as pandemic restrictions are eased further, we can begin to look forward to a sustainable recovery for this vital indigenous economic sector. The importance of tourism in Ireland cannot be understated. It is a sector that has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years across the country. I am confident that, with our support, it will fully recover from the crisis and thrive again in a manner that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. In 2019, prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, tourism was worth €9.5 billion in total to our economy from overseas tourists and the fares they generated, together with domestic tourism. Fáilte Ireland has previously estimated that 23 cent in every euro generated in tourism expenditure went back to the Exchequer in tax revenues. This equates to €1.8 billion in Exchequer revenue. Tourism supported 260,000 jobs across the country, both in remote rural areas and in our towns and cities. It sustains communities and drives regional development in a manner that most other industries struggle to emulate. The tourism landscape changed drastically in early 2020 with the outbreak and spread of Covid-19. It has had a devastating impact on the tourism industry in Ireland and across the world. The pandemic struck Irish tourism towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, by which stage only 10% to 15% of annual overseas spending would have accrued. After the first quarter there was a collapse in overseas travel, and the OECD estimates that international tourism worldwide fell by 80% in 2020. Since the advent of Covid-19 and the consequential and necessary public health measures, many of the jobs supported by tourism have been lost or are surviving with State support, and income from the sector is a fraction of what it was in 2019. Last year, the tourism recovery task force estimated that of the 260,000 jobs in the sector prior to the onset of the pandemic, 180,000 are either lost or vulnerable.The successful domestic summer seasons last year and this year have been very welcome and helpful to the sector. However, the sector cannot begin to fully recover until inbound overseas tourism resumes in a meaningful way. Last year, a tourism recovery task force was put in place to prepare a tourism recovery plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. The task force presented the plan to me in September of 2020 and it has been more than useful for both my Cabinet colleagues and me in considering measures that can assist the sector. I appointed a recovery oversight group to oversee the implementation of the tourism recovery plan and it reports to me on a regular basis with updates on implementation and the recovery of the sector. The group has just submitted its third report to me. I will use the report as an important policy consideration as I continue my work, alongside my colleagues, to support the tourism sector in this most challenging period. It is clear that substantial progress has been made in helping tourism to survive and recover from the Covid crisis. Since the beginning of the pandemic in Ireland, it has been clear that the tourism sector would be severely impacted. My Department, together with Fáilte Ireland and the Government, has responded to this challenge by providing the supports that would enable strategic tourism businesses survive the pandemic and re-emerge in a safe and sustainable manner. In the final months of 2020, I allocated funding to Fáilte Ireland to administer a Covid-19 adaptation fund, an Ireland-based inbound agents business continuity scheme and a coach tourism operators business continuity scheme. Fáilte Ireland also administered the restart grant plus for bed and breakfasts, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In budget 2021, I secured a record level of funding of just under €221 million for tourism, including €55 million for Fáilte Ireland's tourism business continuity scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to support strategic tourism businesses to survive through the pandemic and help drive the recovery of tourism. In total, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I understand that in excess of €75 million has been paid out in dedicated tourism supports. The VAT reduction to 9% until September 2022, has also given the tourism and hospitality sector some additional breathing space, and is helping with its viability and price competitiveness. In addition to these direct tourism-specific supports, tourism businesses have benefited from horizontal supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, as well as the commercial rates waiver, tax debt warehousing and other initiatives such as pathways to work and the business resumption support scheme. One striking statistic is that employees in the accommodation and food services sector alone have been supported to the tune of over €1.5 billion from the EWSS and its predecessor the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS. This is a remarkable figure which shows the Government's commitment to those whose livelihoods have been so negatively impacted by the crisis. In the economic recovery plan, we acknowledge that continuing support for the tourism sector will be important for the coming adjustment period, as public health restrictions are lifted and international travel is restored. I am currently engaged with my Government colleagues in preparing for next week's budget. We will consider both the importance of economy-wide support measures for tourism jobs and businesses and any additional sector-specific measures which may be required. Any further measures must be directed at those businesses and jobs with ongoing difficulties and the restoration of international tourism. While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery. In 2019, overseas tourists spent more than €5.1 billion in our economy. Since the easing of restrictions on 19 July, overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic. The competition globally to attract tourists will be more challenging than ever. To this end, Tourism Ireland has started to roll out the green carpet and welcome back our international visitors, as it works to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept centres on creating a commitment to travel by encouraging people to Press the Green Button - green being the universal colour of go and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners in order to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors. Connectivity is a major part of the picture here. Air access for tourism is a virtuous circle. Increased access drives tourism and increased demand for tourism helps to increase air capacity. I am aware, of course, that aviation poses challenges for the environment and I look forward to what the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has to say on that. At the start of this week, the Government launched the new National Development Plan 2021-2030. With provision for €165 billion worth of investment, this is the largest national development plan in the history of the State. The capital investment priorities for my Department will support economic recovery and resilience in the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media sectors, while also enhancing individual and community well-being and advancing social, economic and environmental sustainability to protect our unique cultural, linguistic and sporting heritage for generations to come. The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on tourism. As we rebuild this vital sector, we must do so in a way that ensures the contribution of the tourism sector to our economic recovery, providing sustainable employment across Ireland in a way that protects our unique environment. With specific regard to tourism capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a sustainable tourism sector - sustainable from an environmental, social, and economic perspective. The new national development plan provides for the delivery of enhanced amenity through investment in tourism product development, including through Platforms for Growth, Fáilte Ireland's capital investment strategy to target projects that have the greatest potential to grow and foster sustainable tourism. I am also excited about the investments we are making in redeveloping and enhancing the sustainability of our national and regional cultural infrastructure, including significant capital projects at our national cultural institutions. For example, the ambitious redevelopment plans for the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork will open up our national collections to even more people, enhancing the visitor experience of the gallery while also protecting and enhancing the sustainability of this historic building at the heart of the city. While many challenges lie ahead, the Government is committed to continuing support for tourism and to working towards its full reopening and recovery. From a tourism perspective, a real recovery will only be possible when inbound international tourism returns. Compared with most other EU member states, Ireland's tourism sector is highly dependent on overseas travel. Such travel accounts for some 75% of spending in Ireland by tourists. Since the pandemic there has been a complete collapse in overseas travel to Ireland. That does not mean that we should not maximise the domestic opportunity over the next few years. While the level of demand from the home market cannot compensate for the loss of overseas tourism, it plays a vital bridging role in getting the industry through the current survival phase. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector, with up to two-thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages, A collaborative approach by stakeholders, including industry bodies, education providers, Departments and State agencies will be required to address the skills shortages in the tourism sector. As tourism and hospitality provide significant employment in all parts of the country, this will be vital for the recovery of the sector. Prior to the pandemic it was becoming clear that the traditional model of tourism was changing. As a Green Party Minister, I am concerned about the tourism impacts on our natural environment and local communities. In this regard, officials within my Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which seeks to mainstream the concept of sustainability. The development of this new policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want up to 2030 and beyond. The tourism sector has proven itself resilient before. I am optimistic that, as our economy and society begin to open up, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for their important contributions to this debate. We are on track to remove most remaining restrictions from 22 October and this will provide a further boost to the tourism sector. In the meantime, our primary focus is to continue with our careful and gradual approach to easing remaining restrictions and facilitating full reopening from 22 October, while supporting the maximum reach of the vaccine programme and allowing time to achieve the full benefits for all those currently being vaccinated. The Government will meet in advance of 22 October to decide on the next phase of easing the restrictions and on what, if any, further guidance might be required beyond that date. Overall, I am confident that our trajectory in managing Covid is very positive. This along with the very successful vaccination programme mean that we should be viewed as a safe destination for holidaymakers. I will ask our agencies to convey this message. With regard to supporting direct access to regional airports, I am providing funding to Tourism Ireland for the regional co-operative market access scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to promote direct air and sea access routes into Ireland's tourism experience brand regions, with matching funding from airlines, sea carriers, airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders, including local authorities. In this regard, I am happy to report that, for 2021, I have increased the funding available for the scheme to €3 million from €2.5 million, the amount available last year before the pandemic struck. To help to stimulate inbound tourism directly into the regions, Tourism Ireland is currently engaged with a number of air carriers to support the promotion of routes into our regional airports. Aside from this, Tourism Ireland also engages in co-operative marketing with Dublin Airport to support inbound routes with strong tourism potential. With specific regard to business tourism and related events, Fáilte Ireland recently briefed the industry on its plans to support the sector and rebuild a strong pipeline of events. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of the industry and the tourism agencies, I understand that over 280 important events lined up before the pandemic, but subsequently postponed, have now been rescheduled. That is worth approximately €200 million to the economy. Another exciting event that has been rescheduled is the highly anticipated Aer Lingus College Football Classic, which was originally due to kick off in Dublin in 2020. It will now take place in 2022 with the first game between Northwestern University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In its first year, this event will attract in excess of 25,000 visitors, most from the US, and many are expected to stay for a week or longer. It is expected to generate some €63 million alone for the Irish economy next year. As ever, these types of events, including the Ryder Cup in 2027 in Adare, County Limerick, are also a fantastic opportunity to showcase our beautiful country and the many attractions it offers as a holiday destination. As regards specific queries raised by Members, my officials have been taking note of them and we will follow up in writing with the Members. Before handing over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I will refer briefly to sustainable tourism. While our focus is correctly on the survival of the tourism sector, we must also begin planning for a sustainable recovery. The global health crisis has left the tourism sector in a state of shock, but it has also provided an opportunity to address sustainable tourism development in a more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following the crisis. A sustainable tourism working group established under the Tourism Action Plan 2019-2021 published a report setting out the ambition for sustainable tourism in Ireland as well as a number of guiding principles for sustainable tourism development. This group has also drawn up an interim action plan, which will be published shortly, that aims to promote sustainable tourism practices up to 2023. In line with the programme for Government commitments, as I have outlined, officials in my Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which mainstreams sustainability. The development of this new policy will be informed by, and build upon, the work undertaken by the sustainable tourism working group and will be consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of the new national tourism policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want up to 2030 and beyond. Tourism has proven itself to be resilient previously and I am confident that, with the support of the Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again in a manner that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Tuigim go maith na dúshláin ollmhóra atá roimh an turasóireacht agus leanfaidh mé ag obair le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas chun a chinntiú go dtabharfar gach tacaíocht is féidir don earnáil chun é a chur ar a cumas teacht slán ón bpaindéim agus tógáil ar bhealach níos seasmhaí, níos digití, níos glaise agus níos inbhuanaithe. I am fully aware of the massive challenges facing tourism and I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Government to ensure the sector is given every possible support to enable it to emerge intact from the pandemic and to build back in a more resilient, digitalised, green and sustainable way.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:"Dáil Éireann resolves that the Broadcasting (Amendment) (Protection of Journalism) Bill 2019 be deemed to be read a second time this day eighteen months, to allow for greater analysis of the complex issues concerned and for such considerations to be taken into account in further scrutiny of the Bill." Is mór agam deis a fháil labhairt leis an Teach faoin gceist thábhachtach a ardaítear sa Bhille seo agus gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Cullinane agus Crowe as aird a thabhairt uirthi. Is fiú i gcónaí díospóireacht chuiditheach a dhéanamh sa Teach. Tuigim an réasúnaíocht a bhaineann le moladh an Bhille seo. As Deputy Cullinane rightly pointed out on First Stage, the banning of journalists by media outlets is a step in the wrong direction.It is something that needs to be challenged in order for the media sector to function as it should. Journalism at its best informs us as citizens, engages us as a society and challenges us as representatives. It is a public good and I recognise it as such. It plays a crucial role in shaping a healthy democracy and is one of the pillars of a democratic society. A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy and freedom of speech, as well as to the provision of quality and impartial information. As Minister, I firmly believe in the safeguarding of media plurality and in protecting the freedom of journalists to perform their jobs without fear of reprisals from other media organisations, such as in the form of bans. To elaborate on this point, I bring to the attention of the House the adoption by Ireland of the Council of Europe resolution on the safety of journalists. The resolution was tabled at the Conference of Ministers responsible for Media and Information Society, which I attended in June of this year. Point two of the resolution is particularly relevant in the context of this debate. In summary, it asserts that the key role of journalists and other media actors in exposing wrongdoing, corruption, crime and abuse of power exposes them to intimidation, threats, harassment, violence, arbitrary surveillance or interception of communications, misuse of national laws, abusive litigation and sometimes to arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In adopting the resolution, the Government affirmed its commitment to the support and protection of journalists. We acknowledged that in order for journalists and other media actors to effectively and safely fulfil their role as public watchdog, they require appropriate protection. They also require an enabling environment for freedom of expression and media freedom in which vigorous public debate can thrive. The Government recognises that journalists and other media actors play a central role in enabling the full enjoyment of freedom of expression. They are critical to the healthy functioning of a democracy. In support of this point, I bring the attention of Deputies to a line from the final declaration adopted by the Conference of Ministers. It asserts that all forms of attacks on journalists and other media actors intended to undermine their ability to perform their public watchdog role must be regarded as attacks on democracy and strongly condemned. It is the responsibility of states to act to effectively prevent, investigate and sanction threats and attacks of all kinds against journalists. The relevant provisions of Bunreacht na hÉireann, as well as Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights, remain the fundamental standards to be applied in the exercise of those rights. Robust frameworks for the protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the media must be in place to ensure that journalists and the media can effectively perform their professional duties, including in times of crisis. These points demonstrate the seriousness with which this Government views the importance of journalistic freedoms. As Minister I thank the Deputy once again for bringing forward this Bill so that a thorough debate can be held, and all arguments considered. Discrimination of any sort is something this Government vehemently opposes. As the House is aware, the Bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 by making it a breach of contractor licence for a broadcaster to prohibit any member of the National Union of Journalists from appearing on its communications media for reason or reasons of occupation, employer, company relationship or employment status. However, while I welcome the debate brought on by the proposal of the Bill, I believe that, as drafted, it raises complexities. These could lead to significant unintended consequences which I will set out presently. It is the view of the Government that these issues require further consideration to ensure the Bill is suitably robust to ensure its effectiveness. It is on this basis that the Government is proposing to defer the Second Reading of the Bill for 18 months in order to allow further consideration of the matter. The proposed change to the Broadcasting Act envisaged in the Bill would lead to a requirement to amend existing broadcasting contracts. Potential inconsistencies of application of the measure may arise across the broadcasting sector, as contracts are agreed for a fixed period of up to ten years. This would lead to a piecemeal landscape in which contract changes are implemented by the broadcasting regulator on an incremental basis over an extended duration of time, in line with the timeline for contract renewal for each individual broadcaster. Furthermore, as the Bill provides for the amendment to be inserted in Part 6 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, it would only apply to commercial and community broadcasters, and not to services operated by RTÉ or TG4. As a Government, it is important that we take account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations. It is a long-established principle that a decision about who should be invited or not invited to appear on Irish radio or television programmes is solely a matter for individual broadcasters. As the Bill could constrain broadcasters' freedom of action on decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion from programming content, the implications of the Bill in the context of freedom of expression would require further research to establish the legality of such an approach. Another issue with the Bill is the lack of detail as to how it would work in practice. It is unclear how the regulator would determine whether a violation has occurred. For example, it is unclear whether this would have to be explicit written policy or an unwritten practice within an organisation. Furthermore, it is not clear how an investigation would initially be triggered. The Bill does not give details as to whether, for instance, such an investigation would be on foot of a complaint from a member of the public or initiated as part of the regulator's routine compliance monitoring. I have concerns regarding the fact the Bill only specifies members of the National Union of Journalists as being able to benefit from this protection. Consequently, it may be deemed discriminatory to journalists not affiliated with this union but who are members of other recognised unions, such as journalists who are part of unions in other member states. Moreover, the Bill does not account for journalists who do not belong to a recognised union. It must also be noted that the context in which the Bill was initiated was the ban imposed by Communicorp Media on journalists from The Currency and The Irish Times from appearing on its radio stations. As the latter of the aforementioned bans was rescinded following a change in ownership of Communicorp Media in June 2021, the Government does not consider that there is an urgent requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature. What matters more is that we get it right. As regards the next steps, the timed amendment I am proposing asks that we take the necessary time to consider the issues and complexities that I have put forward this evening. To reiterate, we as a Government are keenly aware of the issues raised by the Bill, and I thank the Deputy for bringing it forward and encouraging this debate. A free and pluralist media is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy. It should quite rightly be supported. In times of crisis, freedom of expression and information and freedom of the media are vital components of the functioning of democratic societies. As I stated, the Government deems this issue of the utmost importance. We will continue to strive to foster free, open and democratic debate across all forms of media. Ireland's adoption of the resolution on the safety of journalists at a European level reinforces this statement. This timed amendment will allow for the necessary care to be taken when assessing the proposal in the Bill. I know the Deputies speaking on the Bill will make a valuable contribution to the further consideration of the proposals at the heart of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Members who have contributed to the debate. I am grateful to Deputy Cullinane and other colleagues for highlighting the issue and for contributing to the debate. I do not doubt the Bill has been tabled in a sincere effort to ensure the Irish media landscape continues to be an open and pluralist space. I have listened to the Deputies with interest and I thank Members of the House for all of their comments. We agree that the banning of journalists by media organisations raises serious concerns and we must now ensure we consider all of the points raised in the debate. It is also imperative that we take into account possible future consequences of the Bill. As I stated earlier, there are fundamental weaknesses in the structure of the Bill, as drafted, and it is crucial to address these before considering whether a legislative response is the right one and, if so, what approach that legislation should take. A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and the provision of quality and impartial information. As a government we firmly believe in the safeguarding of media plurality and in protecting the freedom of journalists to perform their jobs without fear of media organisations. Our work at European level, as highlighted earlier, shows the seriousness with which we treat the function of journalists and the media in this country. In adopting the resolution on the safety of journalists we reinforce the idea that a functioning democracy requires media freedom. I want to bring the attention of the House to the 2021 World Press Freedom Index as compiled by the international non-profit organisation, Reporters Without Borders, in which Ireland ranks 12th in the world out of 180 countries listed, just two places outside the top ten. This serves to emphasise the high regard with which we hold press freedom in this country. However, I must reiterate the concerns raised earlier in the debate. It is the Government's view that these concerns require further consideration to ensure the Bill is suitably robust and that it is the most appropriate course of action. Of major concern is that the Bill may be rushed through at this point and have far-reaching consequences in future. The Bill was tabled in the context of bans that have now been rescinded. It is essential that we take into account there is not a requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature. The proposed 18-month period will allow us to give adequate consideration to the Bill and ensure we can explore the full range of policy options around the matter. Allowing sufficient time to consider all of the issues involved is the best way to make sure any legislation or policy measure we put in place on the matter takes a careful, measured and well-evidenced approach and will do the best for journalists and our media sector. A free and pluralist media is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy and we should do our utmost to protect and support this ideal. As I indicated, I am broadly supportive of the aims and objectives of the Bill but I have laid out the issues and reasons for proposing an amendment with regard to 18 months. As the Deputy is aware, the online safety and media regulation Bill is being drafted. It is a priority for the Government. The Deputy is also aware it will provide for the establishment of a media commission. Once established, it is my intention to consult it on this specific issue. The establishment of the media commission seemed to be something the Deputy has not considered during the debate. The period of assessment sought is very much needed, particularly for a new media commission to have a role. Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Teach arís as páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht seo ar bhealach tuisceanach agus soiléir agus táim ag tnúth le tuilleadh plé a dhéanamh ar an ábhar seo.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá áthas orm an deis seo a fháil labhairt leis an Teach maidir le Meastacháin buiséid 2022 de €1.197 milliún do mo Roinn agus léargas a thabhairt ar roinnt de na bearta chun tacú le teacht aniar agus fás na n-earnálacha a bhfuil mé freagrach astu. Individually and cumulatively, these sectors are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas, for they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being. This was never more evident than during the pandemic. As we rebuild these vital sectors, we must not lose sight of the valuable contribution they make to people’s everyday lives and livelihoods all across Ireland and enable them to contribute to the resurgence of a vibrant and sustainable economy.  Budget 2022 has been informed by ongoing engagement with the sectors and communities that come under the remit of my Department. That engagement will continue as we implement the policies and programmes to support regrowth and development.  I refer to the funding for the sectors supported by my Department. A total of €288.5 million has been allocated for tourism services representing an increase of €67.6 million. This increased allocation will help address immediate survival issues while also enabling further resilience and recovery as we reopen to international tourism and transition towards a more sustainable future. The increased funding will allow for €50 million in further business continuity support and an additional €27 million for investment in domestic marketing and festivals, particularly during the shoulder season and to assist in attracting and retaining staff in our tourism and hospitality sectors, together with increased capital funding, bringing to €36.5 million the moneys available for tourism product development, to include new and exciting attractions. There is an increase of €35 million in the tourism marketing fund to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland and to begin preparations for the programme for Government commitment to the Year of the Invitation. This significant response to the impact of the pandemic recognises the vital contribution of tourism to our overall economy and jobs.  While our primary focus to date has been on survival, we now have an opportunity to reimagine our tourism sector in the wake of the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on mainstreaming the principle of sustainability from an environmental, social and economic perspective.  Funding for the arts and culture amounts to €346.5 million. Budget 2022 represents a recognition by Government that bold steps are necessary for our much-treasured arts, events, and culture community to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. The extensive package of supports proposed under budget 2022 will allow for this recovery. I am particularly pleased to announce €25 million in funding for the pilot of the new basic income guarantee scheme for artists and art workers. The scheme will bring new life and support to the artists and to those working in the arts and cultural sector after a profoundly difficult 18 months. If there is one lesson to be learned from Covid-19, it is how the arts and culture community was taken for granted up until then. The basic income scheme is a signal from Government to this invaluable sector that it is treasured, appreciated, and will never be taken for granted again.  I am also pleased to maintain funding for the Arts Council for 2022 at the current record level of €130 million. This will empower the council to help artists, art workers and arts to flourish again in Ireland.  Some €25 million is being provided for live entertainment, building on the diverse suite of initiatives introduced for the sector this year in response to the pandemic.  The audiovisual industry continues to be one of the success stories of the past 18 months with internationally successful productions such as the animated feature film, "Wolfwalkers", and the TV drama, "Normal People".I am pleased to increase Screen Ireland's funding by €6.7 million to €36.7 million in 2022 to maintain and grow its output. The extension of section 481 relief to the gaming sector, as well as increased funding of €4.2 million for TG4, will also contribute to the ongoing growth of this vibrant sector. Additional funding of €5 million is being allocated to our national cultural institutions to facilitate increased access to their extraordinary collections and the enhanced audience engagement they developed during the pandemic. A total of €4 million in funding is being provided to help deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force. Finally, €5 million is being allocated to support the 2022 commemorative programme marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022. Budget 2022 recognises the value arts, culture and entertainment bring to people living in Ireland and abroad and the important role artists play in our society, which was particularly evident during the pandemic. It signals a new dawn for the sector, building on existing Covid supports. Funding for the media and broadcasting sector will also be increased in 2022, including €5.5 million for the establishment of a new regulator, the media commission, which will support the provision of high-quality public service broadcasting and oversee effective regulation of online safety. I am conscious my allocated time is running out and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is sharing my slot. In short, our clear objective is to support a strong and sustainable tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, dynamic sports and media sectors and a landscape in which our first language can continue to grow and flourish.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	In its decision of 19 October 2021, the Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector could reopen with a full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the Covid-19 pass. My officials and I have been engaging with the various sectors to address some of the challenges faced throughout the past 20 months in the run-up to the Government's decision and also following that decision. This extensive stakeholder engagement has resulted in the production of an updated set of guidelines for nightlife and entertainment to provide for the safe operation of the sector, as Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities. The guidance contains a range of advice, including on ventilation, hygiene, management structures, face coverings and so forth. In light of the epidemiological situation that has emerged over the last number of weeks, it is imperative that we carefully manage reopening. The Government's aim has been to allow as many businesses as possible to reopen in the safest possible way. This is why we need regulations and robust guidance to assist businesses to reopen safely and, importantly, to stay open. Central to these guidelines is a commitment to adhering to best practice in infection prevention control measures which are necessary to protect individuals and society, as well as supporting our continued progress towards a full return to the operation of various sectors. Compliance with these measures should not be considered best practice but rather the minimum standard required to protect our communities. Individual businesses must proactively risk assess their premises to calibrate mitigation measures in a bespoke way for the business. Covid-19 infection rates have been increasing, along with hospitalisation and ICU admissions, but thanks to the exceptional levels of engagement with the vaccination programme we were in a position to continue our careful and gradual approach to reopening. However, we must redouble our efforts to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. The night-time economy sector, which includes so many businesses, has been patient and was one of the last sectors to return. The sector has worked very constructively with my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments in developing and implementing the relevant guidelines and regulations. This engagement is continuing with a view to safeguarding public health while ensuring we continue to move forward with reopening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy knows, the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, are the relevant bodies under the indoor dining regulations which came into force on 26 July 2021. Since the reopening of the night-time economy from 22 October 2021, compliance officers from the HSE have been undertaking checks, with an initial emphasis on the nightclubs and late bars. This included 123 inspections undertaken between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. on the initial bank holiday weekend, where overall compliance was generally found to be good. A further 50 inspections took place on the weekend of 29 to 31 October covering retail, cinema and related areas. As for the night-time economy, compliance officers from the HSE have been engaged in compliance checks in the night-time sector since 22 October and over the initial bank holiday week over 40 teams of compliance officers undertook checks focusing on the hospitality service sectors, particularly pubs, restaurants and late night venues. Nightclubs in Dublin, Cork and Galway received particular attention. In the engagement this week with the hospitality and nightclub sectors and in further engagement with the arts and culture sector, I believe leadership is being shown by the industry on this. The sectors realise the real risk. Everybody needs to be on board on this in order to keep their livelihoods safe, to keep business reopened and to protect public health.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the calls for a hotline, where a person has a concern that the requirements of the regulations are not being complied with, he or she may communicate this via the HSE live helpline on 1800 700700. It should be noted that anybody doing so would have to press number 3, which is the other issues category. It might be useful to tailor the helpline to allow members of the public to report specific instances in a more targeted manner. This is something we will communicate to the Department of Health, as the HSE is under the remit of that Department. It will a subject of discussion between officials in the Department of Health, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department. Regarding what happens when there is non-compliance, the fines have been set out but, ultimately, there is the threat of closure. We are appealing to businesses that are not checking for certificates, because it is not fair to the other businesses and it is not fair for public health. For both reasons, to protect public health and to help the businesses that have been through such a tough time to keep their businesses open, everybody should abide by the rules.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I note the Deputy's question, as submitted, was to make my views known on the recent sale of a studio to a large real estate corporation, particularly given that the State had only recently disposed of its share of the studios and that the studios have received large amounts of public funding over many years and my further views on whether it is time to take the studios into public ownership. I understand that the sale of this studio is to the world leader in studio infrastructure and as such, this development will inject further essential investment into Ireland's network of studio infrastructure. It is a positive indication of the increasing sophistication of the development of the screen sector in recent years and a vote of confidence in the future of Ireland’s audiovisual industry. The inward investment will assist in establishing Ireland as a primary location for strategic investment in film and TV drama. I understand that the studio will shortly see an expansion of its studio and support spaces with an additional 21,000 sq. ft. of sound stages and 21,000 sq. ft. of support space added. This sale was conducted between two private sector entities. The grounds for any investigation into the circumstances of the sale are not immediately apparent. In any case, queries about the conduct of the sale would be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government’s ambition as stated in the audiovisual action plan is to establish Ireland as a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. Ireland competes internationally to attract inward productions that brings valuable investment to Ireland and this company with its global reach will assist the growth of our audiovisual industry. This development will underpin that ambition. With the growth in streaming services, the demand for high-end TV series is almost limitless. The audiovisual industry is transforming at an exponential rate and I would not favour taking studio infrastructure into State ownership. The circumstances of the sale is a private matter for the studio’s commercial owners. The studio is and was, before its sale, in full commercial ownership and the State has no stake in ownership. It did not receive public funding in the past decade. From an EU perspective, studios are subject to state-aid rules and any state intervention would require EU approval, which would not ordinarily be forthcoming. The Government recognises the very significant success of our audiovisual industry in recent years. This success has been underpinned by the Government’s investment in Screen Ireland, the agency responsible for the development of the screen industry. The studio provides world-class production facilities for both indigenous and incoming productions alike. This sale has the potential to bring new investment which will allow ongoing expansion and secure the future of this iconic studio.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Film studios are privately owned commercial entities, of which there are a number in Ireland with several new studios in various stages of development and planning. There is no rationale for public intervention in the provision of film studios as the private sector is doing so effectively. There is no evidence that the public sector would be more successful than the private sector in running a film studio. Taking one film studio into public ownership would be seen as anti-competitive by other film studio owners. Public funding of film studios is a state-aid matter and the agreement of the European Commission is not likely to be forthcoming if we were to attempt to take this studio into public ownership. There is a well-known case, involving Ciudad de la Luz film studio in Alicante in Spain. In 2012 the European Commission ruled that public subsidies of €260 million had to be repaid to the regional government as the subsidies violated European competition law and the studio closed as a result.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can tell the Deputy what the new investor will bring. As a long-term substantial investor in Ireland's creative sector, it has pledged to support job-train initiatives to ensure that the local workforce grows to meet the increasing demands of domestic and international content producers. It has already pledged a substantial financial commitment towards such job programmes and is looking to partner with stakeholders including Screen Skills Ireland. Its global change endowment has committed more than €10 million to date and focuses primarily on screen-sector employment opportunities for disadvantaged and under-represented communities whether dealing with gender diversity or regionalisation. In the press release announcing the sale, Joe Devine, the chairman of both Troy and Ardmore studios, said on behalf of the shareholders in both Troy and Ardmore that when they were approached, they realised that this investment could really transform-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----the outlook, not just for the two studios but for the wider industry in Ireland. It will help the development of this indigenous industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was delighted, as part of the national economic recovery plan, to secure the commitment from the Government to prioritise the development of a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sectors. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value this sector brings to all Irish citizens. It is something we really felt during the Covid-19 pandemic when they were taken from us. The importance of Irish culture, art and productions as a whole cannot be understated and it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic, as I mentioned. Against this backdrop and my own experience of the arts, funding for the basic income guarantee pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for the budget and I secured €25 million to realise the pilot scheme next year. With regard to the timeline for the launch of the pilot, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise. This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications during the first quarter of 2022. The oversight group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU. My Department will hold a stakeholder consultation forum on 8 December on the basic income guarantee pilot scheme, in particular to tease out the eligibility criteria for the scheme. It is really important we develop the scheme in close consultation with the sector. We will be using a professional facilitator to run a world café method event to ensure the arts sector and resource bodies and representative organisations are given the opportunity to feed into the policy development for the scheme. The selection process for recipients of the basic income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month. However, I can confirm that participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test and it will be a non-competitive process, so once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, that person will be included in a randomised selection process. A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post
facto appraisal of the pilot in due course. Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. It is my intention that the pilot scheme will be open to eligible artists and creative arts sector workers. The process for recipients will be finalised through the stakeholder engagement I mentioned, which should happen next month. I can confirm it will be a non-competitive process and people will be chosen randomly. My intention is to have a number of streams, such as professional artists, emerging and developing artists and arts workers.This will be subject to two further stakeholder engagements in the coming weeks. This consultation is key in that regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Department of Rural and Community Development is working with us and other Departments in order to map out all digital hubs throughout the country, and Údarás na Gaeltachta is also developing digital hubs in Gaeltacht areas. I refer to the Deputy's proposal for the use of digital hubs for arts purposes. I would be interested in any proposal that allows digital hubs to be adapted for arts purposes and I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and with Údarás na Gaeltachta on this matter. I understand the Minister may have mentioned the concept of adapting digital hubs for arts purposes in her discussions with the Arts Council recently.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Since I was appointed the Minister, there has been an incredible focus on the supports needed for this sector. We have had many discussions here about the value of this sector. For years, people have talked about its value while not placing an actual value on it.I have also focused on the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery task force, which related to this pilot scheme, because I saw an opportunity post Covid to place that value on those sectors and to support them. We know that uncertainty about how they can live can prevent musicians and actors from creating. That is why I was delighted to secure that commitment in the national economic recovery plan, which emphasises my commitment to the intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society, which we really saw during the pandemic. These people were deprived of opportunities to perform and earn a living. The next step was to secure that €25 million in the budget for this three-year pilot.  As I said to Deputy Berry earlier, while stakeholder engagement in general is ongoing, facilitated stakeholder engagement will take place next month. I want to cover the disciplines the Deputy mentioned, but with the engagement of the sector. I have mentioned emerging artists, arts workers and everything the Deputy has referred to. This will all have to be teased out in close consultation with the sector. Everything I have done with regard to the sector has been done in close consultation with it. This is a very important issue. What we are doing is groundbreaking and we need to do it properly. That is why I want that consultation with the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am in agreement with the Deputy about that underfunding but things have changed. I secured an unprecedented and record level of funding for the Arts Council this year on foot of last year. I held onto that €130 million. I secured funding of €25 million for this income guarantee pilot. It is to be a three-year pilot so I will obviously seek to secure that funding for three years, and I will secure it because I have a commitment from Government. The intention of the pilot scheme is to study whether such a measure will contribute to ensuring those in the arts sector have that security blanket of knowing that money will come in to help them to do what they do best, to create. It aims to ensure the arts sector remains intact and to provide the artists and creatives with the opportunity to increase their practices, thereby minimising the loss of skills and contributing to the sector's gradual regrowth. It is a no-brainer. I can see why it was the number one recommendation, which is why I am absolutely delighted to have been able to secure that commitment from Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assure the Deputy that it did not take a pandemic for me to appreciate the arts. I am looking around the Chamber and there are many Deputies here who grew up surrounded and enriched by the arts. I do not think I am alone in that. I am looking at Deputy Boyd Barrett and it certainly did not take a pandemic for him to appreciate the arts either. I am in a position where I can make a difference. That is why I am delighted to have been able to secure this commitment. With regard to the three-year pilot, this duration was specified in the number one recommendation of the stakeholders' group. I can go through the detail. It is on page 42 of the arts and culture recovery task force's report. I am taking guidance from, and being steered by, the sector itself. We will tease that out in our engagement with the sector, especially in the world café-style engagement to be held in December. That is where that detail came from.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	We are very aware of the decimation of the tourism and hospitality sectors due to Covid-19 and the necessary restrictions.As the Tánaiste has referenced, it is the messaging and not necessarily the restrictions right now that are causing an issue for them. We are awaiting NPHET’s advice to Government and then will give consideration to supports, if needed. I would also like to inform the Deputy that the Tánaiste and I will co-chair a meeting with the tourism, hospitality and live events sector next Monday. It is right, following NPHET’s advice and consideration of supports. We will liaise closely with them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is happening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I met its representatives last week and departmental officials met them on Monday.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together. I will begin by thanking the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for their work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The report of the joint committee demonstrated the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny, and Oireachtas committees, to the parliamentary and democratic process. I am conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online, that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU-wide basis, and of questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the online safety commissioner. In light of the recommendations of the joint committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny report, I am examining how these difficult issues can be addressed. As I announced last week, I will shortly establish an expert advisory group to report within 90 days on these matters, with recommendations for how best to address them. I intend to announce the membership of the group in the coming days. Following the report of the group, I will consider whether and how to give effect to any recommendations through amendments to the legislation on Committee Stage. Regarding the establishment of coimisiún na meán, it is essential that it has sufficient staff with experience and skills at the appropriate level in order to effectively carry out its regulatory functions. As Deputies will be aware, the commission will have an expansive remit. In the first instance, it will take on the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in regulating both television and radio broadcasters. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill provides that the commission will also be responsible for the regulation of video on-demand services and, through the online safety commissioner, for oversight of the new regulatory framework for online safety. The commission will also have roles in respect of the protection of children, research, education, media literacy and journalistic and creative supports. In carrying out these roles the commission will support and promote an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment. Given the importance of the functions and role of the commission, the Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. While the Commission will ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services, I secured €5.5 million in budget 2022 for start-up funding to support the establishment of the commission. My officials are working with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to start the process of recruiting key staff for the commission. Funding and commencing the recruitment process in advance of the formal establishment of the commission will enable these personnel to hit the ground running and ensure that operations commence at the earliest possible date following the enactment of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The expert advisory group will be examining a proposal that will raise complex legal and practical matters, as I mentioned earlier. For example, in one context there is the complexity in the Irish constitutional and legal context of upholding fundamental rights and respecting due process requirements for complainants, online services and the uploaders of content subject to complaint. From a practical perspective, there are questions regarding the design and resource implications. For that reason, the expert advisory group I will announce in the coming days will need to be able to draw from a wide and diverse range of expertise and experience. I am seeking: legal expertise, especially in the complexities of regulating the online world; knowledge of and expertise in the operation of complaints systems in other contexts; experience in the protection of children's rights in an online environment; and knowledge of and expertise in practical requirements, such as resourcing and organisation required to operate an individual complaints system.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Disinformation is primarily being dealt with through the EU code of practice on disinformation, which is linked to the forthcoming digital services Act. Deputy Naughten is aware that this is still under negotiation. On the question of getting it right, this commission must have real teeth, as it does, including powers of investigation, search warrants, fines of up to €20 million or a percentage of turnover, whichever is more. There is also the possibility of criminal liability and the taking down of the platform. On the timetable, I hope to move as swiftly as possible with this. It will be initiated in the Seanad and I have written to the committee, of which Deputy Munster is a member, to ask for time for the Bill to be considered. The recommendations of the expert advisory group will be taken account of on Committee Stage. I hope that will help speed up the process. On the EU-wide base, the major issue is the 450 million people that we would represent if the platform is based in Ireland, as we would be the country in charge of that regulation. That is why all eyes are on us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value the sector brings to all Irish citizens and how art is an inherent part of Ireland's cultural identity. The importance of Irish culture, art and productions as a whole cannot be understated. It contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. I was delighted that as part of the national economic recovery plan I secured a commitment from Government to prioritise the development of a basic income pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. Funding for the basic income for the arts pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for budget 2022 and I allocated €25 million to launch the pilot scheme this year.  Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department held a stakeholder consultation last month on the basic income for the arts to provide the arts sector, those working in it and resource bodies and representative organisations with the opportunity to engage with the policy development and share their views. Over 150 participants from 50 artists and arts worker resource and representative bodies came together to discuss the proposal and provide their views and feedback to me and my Department. This included three participants from the MEAI. Following the forum, I launched a public consultation on the pilot basic income for the arts on Thursday, 6 January. The consultation will remain open until 27 January. The purpose of the online consultation is to ensure that the public, artists and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to the policy development of the pilot scheme and to offer suggestions from their experiences as artists, art workers and members of resource organisations on key issues, such as scheme objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities. To date, the public consultation has received over 500 submissions, reflecting the significant level of interest in this new policy intervention.  I am aware of the feedback received from the organisation referred to by the Deputy and there will be a stream for developing artists but it will be for a smaller number of individuals than the practising artists and creative art worker streams. It is important to include a number of developing artists in the scheme in order that the research programme can determine the impact of a basic income at all stages of career development.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My entire approach to the pilot scheme is that, by its nature, it is a research project. I do not intend it to be exclusive, but rather as inclusive as possible. It is a three-year research project to determine the impact of a basic income on artists and arts workers. As part of that research, we will need to determine what impact a basic income will have on the entire life cycle of artists from the point when they begin their careers to the point they retire. On that basis, it is critical that we include emerging artists. I do not wish to exclude emerging artists. It is critical that they are included in order that we know how this will impact those at the start of the journey up until they become a practising artist. On supports, earlier today I am glad to say that I announced a new music and entertainment business assistance scheme. It is part of a suite of measures. The grant will be paid for six months from January until June. It is a scheme that is simpler and easier to access. It is for self-employed performers, sole traders and businesses in the music industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. The opinions of the MEAI are, as I said, included in the over 500 submissions I have received and will be considered by the Department. The fairness to which the Deputy referred is at the heart of the scheme. It is important to note that applications for the basic income for artists, BIA, scheme will involve a non-competitive process. Therefore, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria he or she will be included in a randomised selection process. I wish to again state that this is a pilot research project and we hope to learn from it. There was strong support at the stakeholder forum that new and emerging artists should have access to the scheme and be in a position to focus on their practice from the outset of their careers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ag teacht leis an treoir athbhreithnithe um sheirbhísí meán closamhairc, foráiltear sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne a foilsíodh le déanaí go bhféadfadh coimisiún na meán tobhach ábhair a ghearradh ar sheirbhísí teilifíse agus físe ar éileamh atá ar fáil sa Stát chun tacú le léiriú cláir chlosamhairc nua i réimsí éagsúla lena n-áirítear an Ghaeilge agus cultúr na hÉireann, athrú aeráide, agus comhionannas, éagsúlacht agus cuimsiú. Forálann an Bille freisin go n-úsáidfí íosmhéid de 25% den mhaoiniú a bhaileofaí sa tobhach ábhair le haghaidh léiriú chláir Ghaeilge. Ní bhainfeadh aon tobhach ach le hioncam a thuillfí laistigh den Stát agus ghearrfaí é go cothrom ar gach seirbhís a dhíríonn ar mhargadh na hÉireann, rud a chiallaíonn go mbeadh soláthraithe seirbhísí meán in Éirinn ar nós RTÉ agus Virgin Media faoi réir an tobhaigh. Ina theannta sin, bheadh seirbhísí in Éirinn agus seirbhísí atá lonnaithe san Aontas Eorpach i dteideal iarratas a dhéanamh ar an gciste um léiriú ábhair a bhunófaí mar thoradh ar an tobhach. Bheadh rioscaí chomh maith le buntáistí ann mar gheall air seo agus dá réir sin, ní chuirfí tús leis na forálacha tobhaigh sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne ach amháin sa chás go léireofaí i dtaighde déanta ag coimisiún na meán go mbeadh tabhairt isteach tobhaigh den sórt sin ina fhoinse maoinithe cothrom agus inmharthana d’ábhar Éireannach. Tuigim go bhfuil údaráis na Fraince chun oibleagáidí infheistíochta a fhorchur ar sheirbhísí sruthaithe ar nós Netflix agus Amazon. Ar mhaithe le comhsheasmhacht agus trédhearcacht socraíodh gurbh é tobhach ábhair an cur chuige is oiriúnaí don cheist i gcomhthéacs na hÉireann. Ar nós na scéime fuaime agus físe atá ann faoi láthair, ligfeadh an múnla atá beartaithe sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne do léiritheoirí dul san iomaíocht le haghaidh maoinithe ar bhonn trédhearcach agus iomaíocht de réir chritéir oibiachtúla. Ní bheadh sé seo amhlaidh maidir le hoibleagáidí infheistíochta, ina mbeadh cinntí maidir le cineál an ábhair a bheadh le maoiniú le déanamh ag an gcuideachta faoi réir na hoibleagáide infheistíochta.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar eolas, i mí an Mheithimh 2021, d'fhoilsigh Rialtas na Fraince foraithne inar leagadh amach na hoibleagáidí atá ar sheirbhísí físe ar éileamh ar nós Netflix, Amazon Prime Video agus Disney+ maidir le saothair Fhrancacha agus Eorpacha a mhaoiniú. Sonraítear san fhoraithne go bhfuil ar sheirbhísí síntiúis ar a laghad 20% dá n-ioncam bliantúil sa Fhrainc a chur ar fáil d'fhorbairt léiriú scánnánaíochta nó closamhairc ó thíortha Eorpacha nó ón bhFrainc. Is fiú a lua go bhfuil oibleagáidí i bhfeidhm cheana féin faoi chreat rialála reatha na hÉireann maidir le craoltóirí. Mar shampla, caithfidh craoltóirí 10% den am craolta nó 10% den bhuiséad clár a leithdháileadh ar léiriúcháin neamhspleácha. Maidir le hoibleagáidí infheistíochta ar sheirbhísí físe ar éileamh, ar mhaithe le comhsheasmhacht agus trédhearcacht, socraíodh gurb é tobhach ábhair an cur chuige is oiriúnaí don cheist i gcomhthéacs na hÉireann, mar a dúirt mé cheana. Ar nós na scéime fuaime agus físe atá ann faoi láthair, ligfidh an múnla atá beartaithe sa Bhille um rialáil sábháilteachta agus meán ar líne do na léiritheoirí dul san iomaíocht le haghaidh maoinithe ar bhonn trédhearcach agus iomaíoch de réir critéir oibiachtúla. Ní bheadh sé seo amhlaidh maidir le hoibleagáidí infheistíochta ina mbeadh cinntí déanta maidir le cineál an ábhair. Ina theannta sin, faoi dhlí an AE, ní féidir oibleagáid infheistíochta a thabhairt isteach bunaithe ar chraobh léirithe faoi leith san Eoraip. Is féidir liom níos mó info a chur ar fáil don Teachta.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh mar ní raibh mé críochnaithe. Má tá aon eolas breise ag teastáil ón Teachta, cuirfidh mo Roinn é ar aghaidh chuige. Faoi dhlí an AE, ní féidir oibleagáid infheistíochta a thabhairt isteach bunaithe ar chraobh léirithe faoi leith san Eoraip. Is féidir oibleagáid a thabhairt isteach chun ábhar a léiriú nó infheistíocht a dhéanamh in ábhair i dteanga áirithe, mar atá ann sa Fhrainc, faoi chásdhlí an AE toisc gur cuspóir chun leasa chách é teanga oifigiúil ballstáit a chaomhnú agus a chur chun cinn. Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, cinntíonn ár gcur chuige maidir leis an dtobhach ar léiriú ábhair cheana féin go gcaitear ar a laghad 25% den airgead a bhailítear a chaitheamh ar léiriú ábhair Ghaeilge. Is fiú a lua chomh maith go gcaithfidh aon oibleagáid infheistíochta a bheith le haghaidh léiriúcháin ó thíortha Eorpacha agus ní gá go mbeadh ábhair Éireannach i gceist. Is dócha go gcomhlíonfadh go leor soláthróirí móra atá bunaithe san AE atá ag díriú ar Éirinn an riachtanas seo cheana féin tríd a n-infheistíocht reatha. Mar sin, is dócha nach mbeadh beart den sórt sin ina bhuntáiste d'Éirinn.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Thanks are due to the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for their extensive work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. This included 33 recommendations, which shows how complex and important this legislation is. One of those recommendations was that an individual complaints mechanism for harmful online content be provided. This is a matter I have been considering closely for some time. The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the development of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill to date has been to provide the online safety commissioner with the power to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanisms in place with full powers of audit and investigation provided to the commissioner in that respect. The Bill also provides for a super-complaints mechanism whereby nominated bodies may notify the commissioner of concerns regarding a designated online service's compliance with an online safety code or relating to the availability of harmful online content on a service.  I am very conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online. I am also conscious that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU-wide basis, which involves regulating on behalf of a population of 450 million, and of questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the online safety commissioner. In light of the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee, I am examining how these issues can be addressed. I announced last week that I will shortly establish an expert advisory group. I hope the membership of the group will be announced in the coming days. This group will report on this matter within 90 days with recommendations as to how best to address this issue. Following the report of the group, I will consider how to give effect to any recommendations through amendments to the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is exactly for all of those reasons that I have established this expert group to examine the proposals. There are significant complex legal and practical issues in this area. For example, in the constitutional and legal context, there is the complexity of upholding fundamental rights and respecting due process requirements for complainants, online services and the uploaders of content that is the subject of a complaint. I direct the Deputy to the binding codes and the real teeth this commissioner will have. Provision is to be made for fines of up to €20 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is greater, for criminal liability for those involved, search warrants and the blocking of platforms. Within the expert advisory group, I hope to have the legal expertise required, particularly with regard to complexities of regulating the online world; knowledge of, and expertise in, the operation of complaints systems in other regulatory contexts; experience in the protection of children's rights in an online environment; and knowledge of, and expertise in, the practical requirements, such as resourcing an organisation required to operate an individual complaints system. That is what I hope to have in this expert group.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is the intention. I spoke previously about the detail and real teeth of this commissioner. We have already started the recruitment process for the commissioner, in parallel with the progress of the Bill through both Houses. I will be initiating the Bill in the Seanad, and I have written to the relevant joint committee in that regard. That we have started the recruitment process for the online safety and media commissioner shows how seriously this Government is taking this issue. This Government and I will always seek to protect children online rather than the technology companies. This is about safety online, and that is where our focus is.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I must clarify that policy responsibility for the core issues at the heart of this matter, namely, the protection of architectural heritage, urban regeneration and planning legislation, rests with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Implementation of such policies on the ground falls, to a great degree, to local authorities, which in this instance is Dublin City Council. The local authorities have particular responsibilities and powers under the planning Acts regarding the safeguarding of protected structures, such as the Iveagh Market, and development proposals affecting such structures. Our heritage and cultural offering, including our built heritage, is an important underpinning of the wider tourism offering, but any possible role for my Department or the tourism agencies regarding the Iveagh Market might only arise, once any legal issues have been resolved, at a later stage in the process, should a tourism-related development be proposed or advanced. This question from the Deputy concerns my responsibility in this regard in the context of tourism. In that case, in line with its tourism development functions, Fáilte Ireland could consider the proposal and any possible agency supports. My Department's role concerning tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy development and in securing resources to assist the tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in implementing that policy. Accordingly, the development and enhancement of our tourism product offering and related funding decisions are operational matters for Fáilte Ireland. Commenting more generally on the role of heritage and culture as part of the overall tourism offering, Fáilte Ireland has advised that prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic more than 70% of overseas tourists to Ireland visited sites of historical or cultural interest. Accordingly, to develop more participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland has prioritised capital investment in projects that will deliver innovative and interactive experiences in which our visitors can immerse themselves. With specific regard to Dublin and Fáilte Ireland's supports to enhance the city's heritage and cultural offering, examples include the Dublin surprising stories small grants scheme. This is offered in tandem with continued support by Fáilte Ireland for tourism issues in Dublin.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In her absence, I commend Deputy Bríd Smith on the work she is doing on this issue. Again, I remind Deputy Boyd Barrett that the policy responsibility for the core issues at the heart of this matter, namely, the protection of architectural heritage, urban regeneration and planning legislation, do not lie with my Department but with that of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Any role for my Department or the tourism agencies regarding the Iveagh Market would come at a later stage in the process, once any legal issues have been resolved, if a tourism-related development is proposed or advanced. The role of my Department comes later, once the legal issues have been resolved.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Department held the remit for heritage before I became the Minister, but that responsibility has now moved over to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I am looking at Deputy Bríd Smith's question before me and it directly relates to the tourism aspect. My role does not come into play until the legal issue is worked out. As I said, the architectural heritage responsibility rests with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, while urban planning and development policy is primarily a matter for local authorities. County and city development plans are drawn up by the local authorities in accordance with their functions under the Planning and Development Acts. I reiterate that the heritage responsibility is no longer with my Department but with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 78, 81, 99, 100, 120, 127, 128, 130 and 152 together. The number of questions on this issue goes to show the interest in and support for our arts in this House, which I welcome. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens and how art is an inherent part of Ireland's cultural identity. The importance of Irish culture and art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be overstated. They contribute to individual and societal well-being, as well as to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society has been particularly evident during the pandemic. I was delighted that as part of the economic recovery plan, I secured a commitment from the Government to prioritise the development of a basic income pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. This was the number one recommendation from the arts and culture recovery task force. Against this backdrop, and my own experience of the arts, funding for the basic income pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for budget 2022 and I secured €25 million to launch the pilot scheme this year. The basic income for the arts will allow artists and creative arts workers to focus on their creative practice and to help support the arts as they recover from the devastating impact of the Covid pandemic. Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic. As the Deputies are aware, my Department held a stakeholder consultation last month on the basic income for the arts, to provide the arts sector, those working in it and the resource bodies and representative organisations with the opportunity to engage with the policy development and share their views. Over 150 participants from 50 artists and arts workers resource and representative bodies came together to discuss the proposal and provide their views and feedback. Following the forum, I launched a public consultation on the pilot basic income for the arts on Thursday, 6 January. The consultation will remain open until 27 January. The purpose of the online consultation is to ensure that the general public, artists and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to the policy development. To date, we have received over 500 submissions on the public consultation. It is important that we get their suggestions from their experiences as artists, arts workers and members of organisations on the key issues such as the scheme's objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities. The selection process, application details and rate of payment for recipients of the basic income for the arts pilot scheme will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement and online consultation. However, I can confirm the following. Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test. It will be a non-competitive process and, as such, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, he or she will be included in a randomised selection process. A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of the pilot in due course. Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement. Eligibility will be based on the legal definition of the arts as contained in the Arts Act, namely, that "arts" means any creative or interpretative expression, whether traditional or contemporary, in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes. There will be a number of ways of demonstrating eligibility, including but not limited to membership of a relevant representative or resource organisation. Applications will be through an online portal. The intention of the pilot scheme is to study whether a basic income contributes to ensuring the arts sector remains intact, provides artists and creatives with the opportunity to increase their practice, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to the sector's gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits, social and economic, local and national. On the timeline for the launch of the pilot, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise. This is a significant undertaking and work is ongoing to develop the online portal and review the hundreds of submissions received on the topic. I have always stated that my ambition is to open the scheme for applications in the first quarter of 2022 and that remains the case. Once applications have been received, these will need to be assessed for eligibility and I expect that process would take at least six to eight weeks depending on the volume of applications. On that basis, I would expect to see the first payments issue in April. That timeline could be subject to change if the volume of applications is very high.However, I reiterate that the basic income for the arts scheme is a key priority of mine and we in the Department are devoting as many resources to it as possible to ensure that we reach our goal of opening for applications in the first quarter.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The basic income for the arts pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the arts and cultural sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. In addition to this measure, I have also secured continued investment of €130 million for the Arts Council in 2022. Combined, these measures will significantly contribute to the development of the arts in Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will revert to all of the Deputies.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Two weeks ago, Ashling Murphy went out for a run along the canal in Tullamore. It was the start of the new year for the talented musician and much-loved beautiful young woman. She never made it home. Ashling's tragic and horrific death shocked the nation. I wish to convey my deepest sympathy to Ashling's family; her partner, Ryan; her friends; her colleagues; her pupils; and the community in which she was so loved and had an active part. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. Ashling's death did indeed stun the country. It also brought us together to say that enough is enough and violence and abuse of women will not be tolerated anymore. Where we see it or hear it, we should call it out. We should call out whoever is involved in it. Whether that abuse or threat is in the workplace, in a person's home or online, we should call it out. I agree with the Taoiseach that it is time for a zero-tolerance approach to violence against women. When I attended Ashling's funeral in St. Brigid's Church, close to her home in County Offaly, last week, I was struck by the little notes placed alongside the candles in the nearby community centre which recalled Ashling in all her brilliance, youth, happiness and talent. The commitment of friends and fellow musicians was so evident at her funeral. I will never forget the tearful faces of the players, strumming on the guitar or playing the bosca ceoil, united in grief on that cold morning at the cross in Mountbolus as Ashling's remains passed. Scores of musicians later attended the graveside where she was buried. That moment showed how Irish rural communities rally round each other when there is pain or suffering.  Equally, as a society we can build support to ensure that violence against women ends. Violence against women is not a string of random, freak or isolated events. They are frightening to hear about and it is perhaps more comforting to think of them as individual. However, we will never move to a truly equal society until we admit the depth, breadth and pattern of gender-based violence. Whether in the most private or public of settings, the fact is that women and girls are less safe. As the House knows, work is progressing on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Work by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is nearing conclusion. The crux of the strategy is what we talked about: zero tolerance of violence against women. There are legislative improvements, too. The commencement of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 on 1 January 2019 created significant improvements, including the creation of the offence of coercive control. The Minister for Justice also prioritised the enactment of Coco's Law, which outlawed image-based sexual abuse, and she is committed to working on a Bill creating new criminal offences for stalking, an area on which Senator Chambers is also working. However, preventing abusive behaviour also requires an end to certain attitudes held by men. Misogyny in our society must stop. There is no easy way to end domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. It will take a combination of new, well-resourced services, robust legislation, fresh thinking, dynamic new strategies and above all, education and awareness.  Briefly, I will outline areas that I am progressing under my responsibility as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. In relation to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, an online safety commissioner will devise safety codes to ensure services minimise the availability of harmful content. This includes reducing the availability of criminal content that disproportionately hurts women, such as image-based abuse, revenge porn, threatening content and harassment, and reducing the availability of material used to bully or humiliate people. In relation to the protection of women in the arts, my Department recently funded the Irish Theatre Institute's report on bullying and harassment, Speak Up: A Call for Change. It found that 70% of those surveyed in the arts experienced some type of harm, including sexual harassment or assault, and women were three and a half times more likely to experience sexual harassment than men. In response, the allocation of public funds in arts agencies will now be in line with work safety and reporting rules. Counselling has also been extended for artists and work-based training has been improved. My Department is also funding vulnerability training courses in the night-time economy. The objective of six recent courses was to enable workers in the night-time economy to identify issues around vulnerability management and violence against women. Hundreds of staff across 70 venues took part and training was delivered with the support of An Garda Síochána, vintners groups and practitioners in night culture, such as Give Us The Night. Whatever sphere of life violence enters through, it pierces the heart of every corner of life. One woman described it to me:[It is] a source of great pain that it happened to me when I was a young woman. That scar never gets to truly heal over. It opens every time I hear of another woman who has been raped, assaulted or worse. The edges widen when that violence is diminished.Tá mná agus cailíní ag éisteacht liom inniu atá ag fulaingt de bharr foréigin agus fanann sé leo ar feadh a saolta. Is iad ár máithreacha, ár n-iníonacha, ár ndeirfiúracha agus ár gcairde. Tá sé i ngach réimse den saol agus i ngach cearn den tír agus cibé áit atá sé, tá daoine ciaptha agus céasta dá bharr. Equality for women and girls, as our end goal, must start with the elimination of violence that has a basis in gender. 
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Before I answer, I acknowledge the devastating developments overnight in Ukraine. As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said earlier, we utterly condemn this act of unjustifiable war and our hearts and thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. The basic income for the arts pilot scheme will run over a three-year period and the intention is to research the impact a basic income would have on artists' and creatives' work patterns by providing the opportunity to participants to focus on their practice and to minimise the loss of skills from the arts, as a result of the pandemic. Stakeholder engagement has been core to the policy development process and this included a stakeholder forum on 15 December 2021 and a public consultation throughout January. The impact of such a scheme on artists with disabilities is a theme that has been raised throughout the consultation and I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter I take very seriously. I want to ensure that all artists, including those with a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot. The Department of Social Protection was a member of the oversight group I established last year tasked with appraising the recommendations set out in the Life Worth Living report. That group met eight times last year and the Department of Social Protection attended each of those meetings. In addition, an interdepartmental working group, including the Department of Social Protection, was established to support the work of the oversight group. It met seven times last year and the Department of Social Protection attended each of those meetings. In addition, bilateral engagement between the two Departments on the treatment of the basic income for the arts payment has been ongoing, with at least seven meetings over the past number of months.In particular, discussions around the treatment of the grant payment for the purposes of income disregards across a number of social welfare schemes, including disability allowance, are ongoing. I assure the Deputy that the issue of artists with disabilities is something on which I am focused. I believe the basic income for the arts has the potential to help artists and creative arts workers with disabilities overcome labour market barriers by creating a self-sustaining creative practice operating on a self-employed basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am determined to ensure the voices of artists and art workers are heard in the development and delivery of supports to the sector. In terms of the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, as the Deputy will know, this recommendation arose from the recommendation from the arts and culture recovery task force and is subject to ongoing consultation. I believe the whole process must be based on that consultation because it is a game changer for the arts community. A wide range of issues with regard to the operation of the proposed scheme, including the issue of artists with disabilities, have been raised in the context of this consultative process. These are now being considered by my Department in the context of finalising the scheme. I appreciate this issue has been raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others, including Deputy Hourigan. I assure the Deputy there is ongoing engagement at present across government and, as I said, with the Department of Social Protection, on all the relevant issues related to this proposal, as there has been since the outset of this process. I intend to launch the scheme and all details with regard to its operation shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I am seeking to bring this to a conclusion and hope to be able to launch it shortly. As I said, however, it is such a groundbreaking initiative and a game changer. My focus is on getting it right and on the consultation with the very voices the Deputy said must be heard. It will be a three-year pilot, as promised. I am determined to get it right and that the consultation is at the heart of the process. I will get it out as soon as possible but, as I said, the consultation is key to this to make sure that when we roll out such a groundbreaking initiative, it addresses all the issues like those raised by the Deputy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A healthy, independent and well-functioning media system is critical to our democracy, providing a platform for diverse opinion, challenge and debate. It is also of key importance for our cultural vibrancy and development, not least in supporting Irish content in a globalised marketplace. Recognising this vital role played by the wider media sector in our society and the fact the media system as a whole is under severe financial pressure, the Government established the Future of Media Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to consider the way forward at a time of profound change and significant challenges. As such, the commission's task was a complex one, with a remit that was broader than simply examining the funding of public service broadcasting. This is about putting in place a sustainable framework for the wider media sector: print, radio and all other platforms. It is about enabling greater accessibility, equality, diversity and inclusivity in the media, supporting environmental sustainability, and the promotion of our language, culture and creativity. On the question of future funding, the commission was asked to examine how public service media can be funded in a way that is sustainable, gives greater security to the sector, ensures independent editorial oversight and delivers value for money. Given the wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations the commission has addressed, it is only right we give the report very careful and detailed consideration. The commission's work must also be considered in the context of a range of other complex and interrelated issues that will require decisions by Government in the media and wider digital space. These include the recently published national digital strategy, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and Ireland's approach to the implementation of the forthcoming Digital Services Act. I met with Professor MacCraith on a number of occasions since the commission was established, including since the commission's report was finalised. I also recently met with an Taoiseach and other Cabinet colleagues as part of our collective examination of the commission's report. It is intended that the Future of Media Commission report will be brought to Cabinet in the coming weeks, following which it will be published. With regard to the current funding model, public sector broadcasting is funded by revenues from the TV licence fee and the Exchequer, with An Post the designated collection agent for the TV licence fee. This will continue until such time as the Government may decide on an alternative funding model.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, the commission completed its work and, last September, the detailed report was submitted to the Taoiseach and me. It contains recommendations on a wide range of issues. I am not going to comment on the content of that report until it comes to Cabinet, but I will say there are far-reaching recommendations that require we give them appropriate consideration. They cannot be considered in isolation, however. As I said, the report is one of a number of developments taking place in the media and digital space that need to be considered in the round. These include the recently published national digital strategy entitled Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework, and Ireland's approach to the implementation of the forthcoming Digital Services Act. As the Deputy knows, we are progressing our Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The report is with me and the Taoiseach. As I said, we met recently with some Cabinet colleagues to consider that. Our ambition is to bring it forward as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I cannot comment on the recommendations of the report until it comes to the Cabinet. As I said, I discussed the matter with the Taoiseach and with Cabinet colleagues quite recently, even this week. I expect it will be brought to all of the Cabinet in the coming weeks. My ambition, as well as that of the Taoiseach, is to publish that report as soon as possible. None of what has been in the newspapers has been verified by the Taoiseach’s Department or my Department. I have read much about what is seemingly in the recommendations. However, as I said, that has not been verified by the Taoiseach’s Department or by me. I even noted reports at the weekend that the Oireachtas joint committee’s position seems to be one that is supporting a household charge. None of these leaks has been verified by anyone. It needs, deserves and is worthy of proper consultation. It is my ambition and it is the Taoiseach’s ambition to publish it as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the national tourism development authority, in line with its statutory functions as set out in section 8(1)(a) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, Fáilte Ireland's role is to support the long-term sustainable growth of tourism in Ireland. Its remit does not extend to jurisdictions outside the State, such as Northern Ireland. Tourism Northern Ireland, which is a non-departmental body of the Department for the Economy in the North, is responsible for the development of tourism in Northern Ireland. Fáilte Ireland develops, supports and promotes tourism at regional and county level within the State in line with the relevant tourism experience brands, which provide the overarching context for enterprise supports, tourism product development and related marketing. There are four regional tourism experience brands covering all counties of the Republic of Ireland - the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands and Dublin. Tourism Ireland promotes the island of Ireland in more than 21 markets overseas as a compelling holiday destination, using the Ireland brand to position the island as strongly as possible against the more than 200 other destinations with which Ireland competes. Tourism Ireland promotes Ireland's four regional experience brands, as well as Northern Ireland's experience brand, Embrace a Giant Spirit, on a range of platforms, including online, overseas trade platforms and other publicity. My Department and both tourism agencies will continue to foster North-South co-operation to enhance an all-island tourism offering and grow international visitor numbers to the entire island. My officials continue to liaise with their counterparts in the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland through monthly meetings and also quarterly operational meetings with both the Department for the Economy and Tourism Ireland. On 20 January 2022, I took part in a shared island dialogue event hosted by the Department of the Taoiseach, which focused on all-island tourism. Over 160 tourism and civil society stakeholders from across the island joined the event online to discuss the success of tourism co-operation on the island of Ireland over the past 20 years and explore how best to enhance opportunities for domestic and international visitors in the years ahead. Over the course of the dialogue, a number of key themes emerged including the opportunity for greater alignment and linkages between tourism initiatives on the island and further developing on a cross-Border basis the on-island tourism that has grown in response to the pandemic travel restrictions.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 My Department will continue to work with the Department of the Taoiseach to implement our commitments to the North-South development of tourism as included in the shared island chapter of the renewed national development plan. This includes supporting Tourism Ireland in its mission to grow tourism into the island of Ireland, to promote the recovery of the sector post pandemic and to work with the Northern Ireland Executive on developing large-scale North-South tourism initiatives which will support the sustainable growth of the sector including cross-Border walking and cycling trails as well as new market opportunities.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism development authority is acting in line with its statutory functions under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003. Fáilte Ireland's remit does not extend to jurisdictions outside the State. From my engagement with Tourism Ireland, I am aware that it does an amazing job in promoting the entire island. Since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council under strand two of the Good Friday Agreement, North-South engagement and collaboration in the area of tourism has added great value to the marketing of the island. I have been there and seen the amazing work they are doing in branding the entire island, including the branding and marketing of the Causeway Coastal Route, Ireland's Ancient East, the Wild Atlantic Way, the Global Greening initiative, the development of screen tourism, including the "Game of Thrones" studio tour, which recently opened in Banbridge, the Taste of Ireland food and drink initiative and maximising the tourism benefits of major sporting events. Tourism Ireland does a fantastic job of marketing the island.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The three tourism agencies operate within a balanced ecosystem within the remit of the enabling legislation. Fáilte Ireland supports tourism enterprises in the Republic of Ireland, Tourism Northern Ireland supports enterprises in Northern Ireland, while Tourism Ireland provides opportunities and support for enterprises across the whole island to promote their businesses overseas. As Deputy Munster says, the structures were established following careful consideration under the Good Friday Agreement. Changes to the function and remit of the bodies would require consultation and agreement on a North-South basis. My focus currently is on ensuring that Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland do the best possible job they can within their existing remit and that we continue the close co-operation we have with our colleagues in Northern Ireland to ensure that visitors to this island can enjoy a seamless experience with a wealth of attractions, activities and hospitality on the entire island of Ireland, in particular as we emerge from the pandemic.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will, when enacted, formally dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and establish a new regulator, coimisiún na meán, which will be responsible for overseeing the regulation of broadcasting and video on-demand services and the new regulatory framework for online safety. Coimisiún na meán will also have functions relating to the promotion of an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment, including research, education, media literacy, the protection of children, and journalistic and creative supports. Part 3 of the Bill sets out the legal basis for the establishment of an coimisiún, including its powers and functions, the membership of an coimisiún as a multi-commissioner body led by an executive chairperson and matters relating to the staffing and superannuation of an coimisiún. It also sets out the accountability of an coimisiún to the Oireachtas and provides for the independence of an coimisiún in the exercise of its functions. Given that infringement proceedings have been launched against Ireland for the delay in the transposition of the revised audiovisual media services directive, which will be given effect in Irish law by the Bill, I am keen to see the Bill enacted by the summer recess. This would pave the way for the formal establishment of coimisiún na meán by ministerial commencement order in the second half of this year. A key milestone in the progress of the Bill through the Houses was marked on Tuesday, when I had the opportunity to complete Second Stage of the Bill in Seanad Éireann. That debate provided an opportunity for me to set out what I believe are the most important provisions of the Bill, including the establishment of an coimisiún, and for me to listen to the perspectives of Senators from all sides of the House. Based on that debate, and the widespread recognition of the importance of the Bill, I am confident that we, as parliamentarians, can complete our consideration of the Bill by the summer. I acknowledge that this is an ambitious timeline for a Bill of this scope and scale. However, I believe this will still allow us to give extensive consideration to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages in both Houses. I know that Members of both Houses are as committed as I am to the enactment of the Bill and to the formal establishment of an coimisiún and the commencement of its operation. Given the importance of an coimisiún, the Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. While an coimisiún will, as set out in the Bill, ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services, I secured €5.5 million in budget 2022 to provide start-up funds to resource the establishment process. A programme of work is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise to establish and lead an coimisiún and to lay the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. This includes managing the transition of Broadcasting Authority of Ireland staff and functions to an coimisiún, while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulation set out under the Broadcasting Act 2009. The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage coimisiún na meán is a priority. Work is currently under way between my officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to secure the recruitment of those staff, including the executive chairperson and online safety commissioner, through open, transparent, and effective public competitions. As provided for by Part 3 of the Bill, the recruitment of the commissioners and executive chairperson will be carried out by the PAS. I would expect that these critical posts would be advertised in the second quarter of 2022 at the latest. Part 16 of Bill provides for the dissolution of the BAI and the transfer of its regulatory functions, assets, rights and liability, and its staff to an coimisiún. In this context, it is important to note that the Bill specifies that BAI staff will transfer over on their existing terms and conditions. The dissolution of the BAI and the transfer of its staff will take place following the enactment of the Bill and commencement of the relevant provisions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Disinformation is a significant and complex issue, as Deputy Murnane O'Connor has said, and requires a distinct and targeted response. The EU is currently reviewing the code of practice on disinformation in order to strengthen it and to link it to the forthcoming Digital Services Act, which will set out the standards for platforms in dealing with the issue. The code of practice is a European Commission initiative which involves a range of online platforms, including social networks and advertising industry players, signing up to the self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. The Commission intends that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. In addition, the European Commission has established the European Digital Media Observatory, including a hub here in Dublin City University, which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. In response to Deputy Munster, I do not see the vacuum. The Bill was before the House and has completed Second Stage in the Seanad. It is very much to do with the importance of establishing the commission that we have approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill, and I have spoken about that several times. That is why I secured the €5.5 million. My intention is that the Bill will be enacted and we will have this commission set up.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I want to address the previous issues that I did not get to conclude. I have provided €5.5 million to commence recruitment of staff. The aim is to pass the Bill by the summer. With regard to recruitment, officials are engaging with the PAS and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I expect to advertise for the key commissioner posts in coimisiún na meán in the second quarter of the year. Deputy Murnane O'Connor asked about resourcing. Given the importance of an coimisiún, we approved the establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill so we can move quickly with this. That is why I secured €5.5 million in the budget to provide the start-up funds to resource the establishment process. A programme of work is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff who will have the relevant skills and expertise to establish and manage an coimisiún. This includes the recruitment of the online safety commissioner through an open, transparent and effective process managed by PAS. An coimisiún will ultimately be fully funded by the industry levy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In budget 2022, the Government allocated €67.6 million in additional funding for tourism, thereby bringing the overall tourism services budget to €288 million. This funding will enable the tourism agencies to assist in the recovery of the sector. The funding allocated to the tourism agencies in 2022 includes €50 million for further business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses and a €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund as well as €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development. Fáilte Ireland recently unveiled plans to support a sustained and sustainable recovery of the tourism industry this year. The plans include a doubling of domestic marketing investment to €10 million to drive domestic demand including short breaks all year round. The implementation of four regional brand tourism strategies will be critical to driving the long-term recovery of tourism across Ireland and to capitalising on the anticipated growth in inbound tourism in 2022. There will be further investment in the digital presence of tourism businesses, including enhancing the digital capabilities of more than 400 tourism businesses through Fáilte Ireland's Digital that Delivers programme. A digital audit of more than 800 hotels will be conducted and a suite of digital supports will be rolled out to ensure that businesses are visible, searchable and, most importantly, bookable. Fáilte Ireland will help address staffing and skills issues in the tourism and hospitality sector, including the first-ever excellent employer programme. The agency will assist businesses in their immediate recruitment efforts and help them to commit to driving long-term change and to making the industry an appealing and rewarding workplace that can attract and retain talent.  Fáilte Ireland will continue its investment in new and enhanced and best in class visitor experiences. Projects that will open between now and 2025 will be dispersed throughout the country and will help drive visitor growth with a strong focus on the outdoors. This will be complemented by a strong network of festivals and events such as the Fleadh Cheoil 2022, which I am pleased will return as an in-person physical event, taking place this summer in Mullingar. The Fleadh Cheoil is the world's largest annual celebration of Irish music, language, song and dance and it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to the host town.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is much to address there. As I outlined earlier, there has been that increased funding in the form of the €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund, as well the €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development. The Deputy will be aware of the largest-ever investment announced last year by Fáilte Ireland in Westport, Dublin, Donegal and Cavan. That is the investment in those new visitor experiences. From my engagement with Tourism Ireland I can tell him there is pent-up demand to visit Ireland. People are being attracted by the key attractions the Deputy mentioned such as the greenways, walkways and blueways. I am acutely aware of those commitments in the programme for Government and how they can really drive the tourism industry back. I am of course working closely with Fáilte Ireland to encourage people to still holiday at home and support our tourism industries. There is engagement with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on recruitment. He is doing fantastic work there and has worked with the Irish Hotels Federation on that, as the Deputy will be aware.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Mar Aire Turasóireachta, Cultúir, Ealaíon, Gaeltachta, Spóirt agus Meán, fáiltím roimh an deis labhairt libh anseo inniu i nDáil Éireann, go háirithe agus muid ag cur tús le Seachtain na Gaeilge 2022. Mar léiriú ar thiomantas an Rialtais chun tacú leis an obair atá ar bun maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, tá sé tábhachtach dúinn féachaint ar an infheistíocht atá á déanamh againn sa teanga. Léiríonn an chistíocht méadaithe atá curtha ar fáil agam don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht i mbliana, agus é ar fiú €85.6 milliún, tiomantas an Rialtais do chur chun cinn na teanga agus do phobal na Gaeltachta, tobar na teanga. Seo ardú €7 milliún ar chiste na bliana seo caite. Is le gach duine sa tír an Ghaeilge, óg agus aosta, agus ba mhaith liom a cheapadh go dtugann an t-allúntas breise seo deis dúinn ár ngrá don teanga a roinnt ar níos mó de phobal na tíre. Ba mhaith liom níos mó deiseanna a chruthú do dhaoine óga a thagann ó chúlraí faoi mhíbhuntáiste an Ghaeltacht a fheiceáil, mar shampla. Chloisfidís an teanga á labhairt mar theanga bheo timpeall orthu agus iad ag cur fúthu i measc phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil oifigigh mo Roinne ag breathnú ar na féidearthachtaí gníomhaíochtaí nua a fhorbairt sa spás áirithe seo agus cuirim féin agus an tAire Stáit fáilte roimhe sin. Léiríonn Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010 – 2030, agus an plean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge in éindí léi, polasaí an Stáit don Ghaeilge agus do na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá úinéireacht tras-Rialtais ag an straitéis agus an plean gníomhaíochta a thacaíonn léi agus, dá réir sin, tá sé de chúram ar Ranna Rialtais, ar fhorais agus ar eagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta an plean a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá de chúram ar mo Roinn an obair sin a chomhordú chomh maith, dár ndóigh. Foilsíodh an dara tuairisc ar fheidhmiú an phlean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge roimh an Nollaig 2021. De thoradh na comhpháirtíochta agus na comhúinéireachta a bhaineann leis seo uile, is údar sásaimh é domsa go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach le sonrú sa dara tuairisc seo. Den 185 gníomh sa phlean, atá á bhforbairt ag thart ar 60 páirtí leasmhar, bhí 51 gníomh le cur i bhfeidhm idir 2018 agus deireadh 2020. Bhí 27 gníomh curtha i bhfeidhm ag deireadh 2020 agus 16 eile idir lámha. Bhain moill le hocht gcinn acu. Tá an tAcht teanga nua achtaithe agus deireadh curtha leis an maolú ar úsáid na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpaigh ó shin, dár ndóigh, péire de na bearta polasaí is mó i saol na Gaeilge a cuireadh i bhfeidhm le fada an lá. Cuimsíodh an tréimhse ó mhí Iúil 2019 go mí na Nollag 2020 sa tuairisc. Gan amhras, bhí sé dúshlánach feidhmiú le linn na paindéime le cúpla bliain anuas, ach mar sin féin, tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta in ainneoin na ndúshlán a chuir an phaindéim romhainn. I measc na ngníomhaíochtaí eile a cuireadh i gcrích, cuireadh pacáiste tacaíochtaí breise múinteoireachta agus eile ar fáil do scoileanna atá ag glacadh páirt sa scéim aitheantais scoileanna Gaeltachta chun iad a spreagadh. Cuireadh tús le clár baitsiléir san oideachas nua lán-Ghaeilge, oideachais tosaigh do bhunmhúinteoirí in Institiúid Oideachais Marino. Rinneadh dul chun cinn thar na bearta leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga agus é faoi bhláth anois. Iontaíodh imeachtaí Gaeilge ar líne ar fud an oileáin agus iarrachtaí móra á ndéanamh ag na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta agus ag pobal labhartha na teanga dul i ngleic le tionchar na paindéime ar an saol. Chonaic muid ranganna scoile agus campaí samhraidh ar TG4, mar shampla, Cé a chreidfeadh é? Fuarthas cead pleanála chun lárionad Gaeilge a fhorbairt ag 6 Sráid Fhearchair, i lár chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, olltogra a bheidh á bhrú chun cinn againn i mbliana. Foilsíodh an foclóir nua Béarla-Gaeilge de chuid Fhoras na Gaeilge. Tá an tuairisc iomlán ar fáil ar www.gov.ie agus molaim do Theachtaí í a léamh. Tá mo Roinn freagrach as na meáin chraoltóireachta chomh maith dár ndóigh. Bhí áthas orm ardú de €4.2 milliún a fhógairt ar bhuiséad TG4 do 2022. Fágann seo buiséad de bheagnach €45 milliún ag TG4. Is é sin an méadú is mó riamh ar mhaoiniú an stáisiúin agus, dár ndóigh, beidh tionchar ag an ardú seo freisin ar rathúlacht na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Bíonn comhoibriú leanúnach idir TG4 agus rannóga éagsúla de chuid mo Roinne agus iad i mbun tograí éagsúla a fhorbairt agus a chur chun cinn mar a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge. Gan dabht, ceann de na réimsí is tábhachtaí ó thaobh na teanga de ná réimse na fostaíochta, agus go háirithe fostaíocht sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá sé de sprioc ag Údarás na Gaeltachta 9,000 duine a bheith fostaithe i gcliantchomhlachtaí Gaeltachta faoi dheireadh na bliana 2025. Anuraidh, cruthaíodh 825 post nua lánaimseartha i gcomhlachtaí Gaeltachta de chuid an údaráis, an líon is airde poist a cruthaíodh in aon bhliain amháin ó bhí 2008 ann. Nuair a thógtar laghdú post san áireamh, bhí glanmhéadú de 446 sa bhfostaíocht ina iomláine, an glanmhéadú bliantúil is airde le 25 bliain. Bíonn comhoibriú leanúnach idir an Clár Éire Ildánach de chuid mo Roinne agus ár rannán Gaeltachta agus TG4 chomh maith, cur chuige a léiríonn go bhfuil an Ghaeilge fite fuaite in obair gach rannóg de chuid mo Roinne. Anuas air sin, shínigh Tourism Ireland agus Údarás na Gaeltachta comhaontú le déanaí ar mhaithe le tuilleadh comhoibrithe a chur ar bun maidir le forbairt tograí Gaeltachta in earnáil na turasóireachta. Táim féin, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, ár bhfoirne agus an Rialtas tiomanta geallúintí an Rialtais i leith forbairt agus neartú na Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm agus leanfaimid orainn á dhéanamh le linn na bliana atá amach romhainn. Go raibh míle maith agaibh agus bainigí sult as Seachtain na Gaeilge.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	That letter has to be brought to my attention. I will read it this afternoon when I go back to the Department and will refer back to the Deputy as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Fáiltím roimh an deis ráiteas a dhéanamh anseo inniu faoin ról ríthábhachtach atá ag iriseoirí i dtuairisciú limistéir choimhlinte ar fud an domhain. Time after time, journalists confront the worst that is happening around the world. They are determined, sometimes at great risk to themselves, to report honestly and truthfully not only on difficult and dangerous conflicts, but also on corruption and the violation of human rights. The fundamental purpose of journalism - the pursuit of the truth – is absolutely vital to us as citizens. Without it we would be left in the dark, at risk of being overwhelmed by disinformation, biased commentary and conspiracy theories. It is important to stress at the outset that risks to journalists fundamentally emanate not from the vocation of journalism, but from threats to journalists from states and criminal and paramilitary groups. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, reports that over 1,523 journalists have been killed since 1993 in the course of doing their jobs. This is a stark and troubling number. To echo the words of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, earlier, we are no strangers to such attacks on our own island. Let us recall the terrible killings of Lyra McKee, Martin O’Hagan and Veronica Guerin. They were each courageous and respected journalists. I have also been struck by the courage of Irish journalists and camera operators, along with all the support staff, who provide us with essential reports from conflict zones around the globe. This is particularly evident in the continuing conflict in Ukraine. The death of Pierre Zakrzewski, an Irish camera operator, alongside 24-year-old Ukrainian journalist and producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova in Ukraine, demonstrates this courage. Pierre's funeral was held in Ireland in March. He grew up in my own constituency in Leopardstown. Pierre was an inspiration; he was larger than life, according to some of his friends and colleagues. It was through his journeys around Europe in his teens, and later in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that Pierre's fondness for photography and politics developed into freelance journalism. It was relayed at his funeral that "his qualities were endless ... he lived his life for the benefit of others". It was also conveyed that Pierre was full of vision, innovative in his work and in the world, a truth teller, full of empathy and what many referred to as "a humanitarian". Journalists working in war zones often share some of these attributes, but the dangers they face can be great. In a separate but no less terrible incident, the shooting of Palestinian Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank earlier this month is a stark reminder of the dangers journalists face in conflict zones. Equally, I condemn the actions of Israeli police at the funeral of Ms Abu Akleh. These were horrific scenes of police brutality at a very sensitive event. The Palestinian-American was a household name across the Arabic-speaking world. I, too, am backing the international calls for an independent investigation into her killing. I also note that a delegation for relations with Palestine, which included two Irish MEPs, was recently informed by Israeli authorities that it would not be allowed to visit the Gaza region "as a delegation". The delegation of six MEPs, including the Green Party South MEP, Ms Grace O'Sullivan, and the Sinn Féin Midlands North-West MEP, Mr. Chris MacManus, were due to arrive in Israel over the weekend en route to Palestine via Tel Aviv. However, at the last minute, the group was informed that the mission would not be able to go ahead. The President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, is currently visiting Israel and has pledged to raise this issue. I echo the concerns raised by my party colleague, Grace O’Sullivan MEP, as well as by the European Parliament President. All threats to journalists, whether in the form of physical or online attacks, represent a threat to media freedom and the freedom of the press. We know that a free, independent and pluralistic media is a vital component in holding a state and powerful institutions to account. It has been said before that the first casualty of war is truth, and we have witnessed that in recent times. The steps taken by the Russian state against its own independent media represent a clear demonstration that it fears the truth about Russian aggression in Ukraine being shown and explained to Russian citizens and is evading responsibility for what is being done by Russian forces in Ukraine. The framework for supporting an independent media includes a robust legislative and constitutional foundation for press freedom and an overarching framework for the regulation of the media that protects press freedom and promotes media plurality. As Minister with responsibility for media, I am keenly aware of the responsibility I and the Government have in providing the necessary legislative safeguards that promote a strong and independent media sector. The Government recognises that journalists and other media actors play a central role in enabling the full enjoyment of freedom of expression and are critical to the healthy functioning of our democracy. We must reinforce the protections afforded to journalists and other media actors engaged in work that is instrumental for the healthy operation of democracy. Media freedom is a core European value that is given expression in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and is a cornerstone of democracy. Without freedom of the press, a well-informed citizenry cannot exist. Without a well-informed citizenry, democracy cannot function in any meaningful sense of the word. Journalists are a central component in our civil society, and a free media has been a powerful force for positive change and democratic transformation everywhere. All forms of attacks on journalists and other media actors must be regarded as attacks on democracy and strongly condemned. As we know from our own experience on this island, threats to journalists are not confined to countries that would traditionally be classified as zones of ongoing conflict.In recognition of the growing number of threats to journalists across the EU, in September 2021 the European Commission published a recommendation on the safety of journalists. The recommendation calls on member states to vigorously investigate and prosecute all criminal acts, making full use of existing national and European legislation. To support the recommendation, first announced in the European democracy action plan, the European Commission has also indicated that it will propose a European media freedom Act in response to growing concerns regarding diminishing media plurality, which can have a chilling effect on independent journalism. The Commission has indicated that the European media freedom Act will seek to ensure that the EU media market functions better by improving legal certainty and will set out a mechanism to increase the transparency, independence and accountability of actions affecting media markets, freedom and pluralism within the EU. I support collaboration between member states in order to safeguard media freedoms across the EU and look forward to working with the Commission and other member states when that Act is published. As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has indicated, Ireland assumed the Presidency of the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe last week. The Council of Europe has played an importance role in promoting the independence of the media and security of journalists. The work of the steering committee on media and information society of the Council of Europe has been particularly important. Last June, I attended the conference of Ministers responsible for media and information society, which adopted a resolution on the safety of journalists, setting out the importance of protecting journalists and an enabling environment for media freedom. This steering committee on media and information society is holding its 21st plenary session next week, at which the topic of journalist safety will be further considered, particularly in light of the conflict in Ukraine. All states have a duty to respect, protect and promote human rights, and it is crucial that journalists and other media actors as part of civil society have the space in which to do their jobs free from violence and intimidation. A free and independent media is indispensable for democracy. I absolutely condemn any threats or attacks on individual journalists or on the foundations of the sector as a whole. We must treat these attacks with the utmost seriousness. Tá sé ríthábhachtach do struchtúr ár sochaí go leanaimid ar aghaidh ag déanamh gach iarracht chun tacú le preas daonlathach agus saor agus chun sábháilteacht iriseoirí a chosaint, anseo in Éirinn agus thar lear.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	At the outset, I acknowledge that the announcement by Dublin Pride last week that it is terminating its media partnership with RTÉ reflects the hurt and anger within the LGBTI+ community and beyond it. I am proud of how far Ireland has come in recent years in terms of the greater respect offered to minorities and groups in society that were previously marginalised, and in particular to members of the LGBTI+ community. I am committed to supporting LGBTI+ people across all the areas under the remit of my Department. In that regard, my Department will be providing €55,000 to support the Dublin Pride festival this year. As the Deputy will be aware, the independence of our public service broadcasters is set out in legislation in section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. For that reason, it would not be appropriate for me to meet with RTÉ in respect of an individual programme. However, I am strongly of the view that media policy and regulation does and must continue to play an important role in ensuring respect and protection for trans people and other vulnerable groups in society. As Minister, my role is to ensure that there is a robust statutory framework in place, with appropriate standards and accountability mechanisms overseen by an independent regulator. Under the Broadcasting Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, as independent regulator for broadcasting content in the State, is required to make broadcasting codes governing the standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters. The two codes of particular relevance are the code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs and the code of programme standards, which is designed to ensure that the representation of persons and groups in society is appropriate, does not prejudice respect for human dignity and does not stigmatise, condone discrimination or incite hatred, including on the basis of protected characteristics. All broadcasters in Ireland must ensure that their output is compliant with the law and with any codes and rules made by the BAI. The Broadcasting Act provides for a robust complaints procedure and sets out the power of the compliance committee of the BAI to initiate an investigation of a broadcaster for a serious or repeated failure by a broadcaster to comply with a broadcasting code and ultimately for the imposition of financial sanctions. The framework for broadcasting regulation is designed to protect the independence of the media and I am therefore necessarily restricted in terms of direct intervention on this matter. I do, however, wish to conclude by saying we must ensure that all our people feel safe, valued and equal in our country. This is particularly the case where people are members of a very small, and consequently very vulnerable, minority, as is the case for trans people. Any conversations involving such a small minority must be carried out with great care and with absolute respect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The framework for broadcasting regulation is designed to protect the independence of the media by preventing interventions by Government or Ministers, particularly the Minister with responsibility for the media, in programming decisions or programming content. As I said, that is outlined in section 98 of the Broadcasting Act. The provisions to prevent the Government of the day from intervening in programme content broadcast on Irish television or radio necessarily and rightly limits the degree to which I can comment on individual terms of content. That is a vital principle that underpins the freedom of the media in our country and, in particular, the freedom of our public service broadcasters.That said, I acknowledge that it can be uncomfortable and frustrating at times.  As I set out in my initial reply, there is a robust regulatory framework in place requiring broadcasters to adhere to appropriate standards and practices. I understand that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media issued a statement yesterday indicating that it does not propose to hold a meeting to consider the broadcasts in question in recognition of the rights of the complainants to be afforded due process in proceedings. It is also important that I as Minister do not intervene in any regulatory decisions of the BAI and allow the process to operate as designed.  I repeat that as a general principle it is important that we conduct our national conversations in a spirit of respect and in recognition of the fundamental dignity of all our people. We must be cognisant of the words we use and how we use them and that is all the more important when we are speaking about a small and vulnerable minority in our society.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Equally, I hope that those events are very well attended. I cannot answer his specific questions but what I can do is tell the Deputy what I am doing in my own Department to support and engage with the LGBTI+ community across the areas under my remit. Under the Creative Ireland programme, the creative communities initiative with local authorities provides funding to support community-led creative projects including for the LGBTI+ community such as Rainbow Library in Cork and the LGBTI+ Inclusion Festival in Galway. The Deputy may also be aware that the Government decided in February of this year to extend the Creative Ireland programme to 2027. As part of this, I specifically proposed that Creative Ireland should deepen its work collaborating through creativity across key interest groups and supporting, among others, LGBTI+ equality promotion. In the broadcasting sector the BAI plays both a regulatory and a development role through support schemes such as Sound and Vision. My officials have been engaging with the BAI regarding the actions it is taking to promote equality, diversity and inclusion in the broadcasting sector in Ireland. The BAI is currently reviewing its 2018 gender action plan.  Finally, I share the Deputy's hope that both events are very well attended. As I outlined in my initial response to the Deputy's question, it would be inappropriate for me to intervene at this point and the Oireachtas committee made the same decision.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. While the recovery momentum in our tourism sector continues, inflation, other economic factors and the significant cost pressures on tourism businesses are likely to impede the recovery. In terms of international perception, there is a risk of damage to Ireland's tourism offering and the promotion of Ireland as a good value destination through negative customer experience arising from the issues and challenges within the sector post­Covid. Many of these issues and challenges, such as reduced services and higher prices as a result of inflation, energy costs, labour shortages, recruitment challenges and supply chain issues, occur in other countries around the world. We see them manifested in Ireland in a lack of affordable accommodation and car rental options in certain areas, and in delays at Dublin Airport.  While I have no regulatory function with regard to the operation of our airports or the car rental sector, I am very aware of the potential impact of negative stories on customer sentiment. In this regard, Tourism Ireland is monitoring sentiment in our source markets in terms of reputational impact as a result of pricing concerns based on consumer, media, industry, and trade feedback and is issuing a weekly report on this matter to my Department. As we enter the peak summer months and the tourism industry recovers, there is inevitably additional pressure on hotel capacity and pricing. Hotel supply in Dublin has been affected by a range of factors, some of which are short term. These include deferred business from the past two years and increased demand. Businesses are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors, all of which have contributed to higher prices than in 2019. It is important that Ireland maintains its reputation as a value for money destination. Value is not just about the price the customer pays; it is also about what the customer gets for that price so that visitors are attracted back again and continue to recommend Ireland to family and friends. We cannot assume that 2022 will be a baseline for linear growth in future years because it is an exceptional year as we emerge from the Covid years of 2020 and 2021. Next year will present its own challenges as the pent-up and deferred demand that we are seeing at the moment might be dissipated. The distorting effect of the pandemic makes it difficult to definitively assess the long-term supply and demand situation but there does seem to be a clear need for more short-term accommodation supply, specifically in Dublin.  We all want to see the return of a sustainable and vibrant tourism sector and I must stress how important it is that businesses maintain a long-term perspective on competitiveness and value for money. The céad míle fáilte reputation that the sector has built up over the years is an important element of our tourism offering and must be protected.  With regard to assisting inward tourism, Tourism Ireland, as part of its marketing strategy, established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand. Over €80 million will be invested in the programme in 2022, which will allow Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets.  My officials continue to engage with many stakeholders, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation, in order to further understand the underlying issues impacting the recovery of the tourism sector and to emphasise the importance of maintaining a strong value proposition at the core of tourism. Department officials are also working with the tourism agencies to identify potential remedial actions such as the reweighting of marketing campaigns to ensure promotional activity is aligned with supply across the year. Tourism Ireland's promotional activity right now is focused on driving demand for later in 2022. The Tánaiste and I co-chair the tourism and hospitality forum, which is due to meet next week. This will offer another opportunity to discuss and address the many issues facing both sectors.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies. I am concerned about any potential reputational damage to Ireland. We must be seen as a value for money destination so that people would want to return. Neither my Department or Fáilte Ireland have any role in setting the prices for accommodation. Commercial decisions such as pricing are the sole responsibility of business owners. I would continue to urge accommodation providers to be mindful of that longer-term picture with regard to competitiveness and value for money. I believe the distorting effect of the pandemic makes it too difficult, as I have said, to robustly analyse the long-term supply versus the demands to meet currently. Reference was made to Europe. Our hotel occupancy in Dublin is now one of the highest in Europe. It is driven by a range of factors, some of which are short term. I believe that in Dublin we have been running at 10% above Paris, Amsterdam and London in recent weeks. That shows the demand that is there. Pricing is, ultimately, a commercial decision for each business. We do not have a role in that but I would urge accommodation providers to be very mindful of the need to attract tourists back. I believe that what is happening now is probably due to the pent-up demand from the past two years. On the costs of car rental and the issues with the Dublin Airport Authority, of course I am aware of these. The DAA issue is an operational matter for it. It may be more for my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. On the car rental costs I have no remit there but I have had-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My Department officials have engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation on this very issue. On the VAT question I would point out that the reduced VAT rate applies to a wide range of businesses in addition to the hospitality sector, many of which are still trying to rebuild after a very difficult and stressful two years. These include catering, restaurant supply companies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, certain printed matter, and hairdressing. While no option should be off the table in the context of encouraging price moderation and a strong focus on a good value-for-money proposition into the medium and long term, it is likely that a disapplication of the extension of the reduced VAT rate would damage many hotels around the country. The extension of the VAT reduction is providing an important support to rebuild. Nonetheless, no potential option should be off the table, as the protection of the value-for-money proposition in Irish tourism is a critical priority for the years ahead. I will be making that very clear at the Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which the Tánaiste and I will be co-chairing next week.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy asked about the steps I am taking to support the live performance sector. In 2021, my Department paid out grants of almost €54 million to support the live entertainment sector and drive employment opportunities for artists and crews, through the following schemes. There was €25 million for the live performance support scheme, LPSS; €13.7 million for the events sector Covid support scheme; €8.8 million for the local live performance support scheme; €3.1 million for the music and entertainment support scheme; €1.7 million for the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme; and €880,000 for the St. Patrick's Festival. Following budget 2022, I announced details of another €50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022. That has provided for the LPSS 2, which supported pantomimes and seasonal musical theatre impacted by the Covid restrictions in December and January, and under which €2.9 million has been offered. The LPSS 3 supported events due to be staged in December and January that were curtailed, cancelled or rescheduled due to the Covid restrictions. Grants of €9.5 million have been offered under LPSS 3. The live performance restart grant scheme, LPRGS, is supporting the live entertainment sector by providing businesses with restart grants to derisk the planning of events across spring and summer of 2022 and to assist with the costs of reopening. Grants of €14.7 million have been offered under the LPRGS. There was also €1 million for the St Patrick’s Festival. The music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, provided grants as a targeted support for self-employed performers and sole traders operating solely in the live entertainment sector. Some €2.8 million has been allocated under MEBAS 2022. The local live public performance scheme phase 3 has provided €5 million for local authorities to stage live events until the end of June. I have recently allocated a further €5 million to local authorities to provide for live events until Hallowe'en. Grants of €1.7 million have been provided under the 2022 commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, which assisted with the capital costs associated with reopening after closures due to the pandemic. To date, grants of almost €42.6 million have been allocated. None of the live performance schemes has been oversubscribed and there has been sufficient funding available to provide grants to all eligible applicants.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Venues are a critical part of the landscape of musicians and bands, and music venues in west Cork are among the most high profile in the country. I am pleased a number of venues in that part of Cork were among the grantees under the live entertainment schemes operated by my Department, including the iconic De Barra's, Shanley's bar, Levis's in Ballydehob and Connolly's of Leap. In regard to any delay, all requests for payment are being processed and the Department is supporting any grantees who have outstanding information to submit it. Payment continues to issue on a rolling basis as grantees submit their documentation and payment requests, and all payment requests and requests for information are being addressed without delay. Once an application has been deemed eligible and a grant offer made, a service level agreement, SLA, issues to the grantee along with further information on the drawdown procedures and notice of the feedback required on conclusion of the activity the grant supports. Once the signed SLA and payment request have been returned along with other necessary supporting documentation, the payment request is examined and, if all is in order, payment is made. From time to time, further information may be required or vital documents may not have been included with the payment request. In that instance, the Department will contact the grantee and provide assistance with what is needed. That can cause a delay in payment, but as soon as all the necessary documents are there, it will be processed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I referred to the live performance restart grant scheme, LPRGS, which is supporting the live entertainment sector by providing those businesses with restart grants to derisk the plan of events in the spring and summer, and I hope that will assist with the costs of reopening. As I said, €14.7 million has been offered under the LPRGS. I can revert to the Deputy with information on the date. That is no problem. Much of this funding related to Covid supports. We will keep everything under review as we enter the budgetary process and see Covid numbers rise. It may be that some funding could be allocated, but that will all depend on where we are with Covid. We keep in close contact with the sector at all times, and that is why we were able to design schemes that worked for it. That will continue and, as I said, we will monitor the situation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I introduced the local live performance support scheme, LLPSS, in 2021 as part of a suite of measures aimed at supporting the live entertainment sector through the Covid pandemic. The scheme allocated funding to local authorities to stage live events and thereby animate our town centres for local communities. A key objective of the scheme was to provide for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers and local crews in their communities. I provided funding of €8.8 million in 2021 to the LLPSS and the scheme proved very popular, with events taking place in every county. Every local authority participated, with 352 events taking place during 2021. In that year, the scheme provided for more than 7,800 employment days, while more than 5,600 individual artists, performers, production and technical crew benefited from it. Across the four local authorities in Dublin, 122 individual events that took place in the same year were funded by the LLPSS. This resulted in 1,692 employment days for 1,006 individual artists, performers, production and technical crew benefiting from events in Dublin under this scheme. Feedback from local authorities was overwhelmingly positive, acknowledging the scheme has helped to reinvigorate local communities and provide a welcome boost to their economies during the pandemic. This year, I provided €5 million for events up to the end of June to provide a boost to the reopening of the entertainment sector, allowing live events to take place and local talent to perform to audiences throughout the country. Given the events are ongoing until the end of the month, the feedback surveys detailing the number of artists, crews and events to date in 2022 are not yet available. In light of the success of the scheme, I recently allocated a further €5 million to provide for events up to Hallowe'en. I am delighted the local live performance programming scheme for local authorities has been such a success. It is part of a €50 million suite of supports in 2022 for those working in the live entertainment sector and has provided support to many working within it. I look forward to seeing communities enjoy the wide range of events over the coming months.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2021, the scheme provided for 7,800 employment days among more than 5,600 individual artists. That relates to the overall scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	For Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, €245,000 was given. We give that money and the local authorities then look after the events and the artists from that. The Deputy will have seen those recent events, such as one relating to the poetry of Séamus Heaney in Irish from Féile IMRAM and Tír na nÓg in the Mill Theatre. I think there was even a baby rave as well. The four local authorities in Dublin were given €245,000 each year. We give the money to them and they employ the local artists and organise the events.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is about babies dancing together and exploring the wonders of music and rhythm at an early age.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the most recent tranche was the €5 million for events up to the end of June and, more recently, due to its success, a further €5 million that will run up to Hallowe'en. The various supports put in place for the live entertainment sector were designed to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and, in particular, the constraints imposed on live performance by the necessary restrictions on indoor and outdoor congregation. These supports were designed in close consultation with the stakeholders and have been the subject of very positive feedback. Thankfully, we are in a position whereby the restrictions have fully lifted and the rationale for interventions no longer applies. Nonetheless, my officials will remain in contact with stakeholders throughout the sector. While a continuation of the existing schemes is not envisaged, we will continue to engage in the coming months and I anticipate submissions from the sector in advance of the budget, which will be considered in the normal way ahead of budget 2023.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Platforms for growth is Fáilte Ireland's strategic, platform-based approach to large-scale capital investment in tourism product and it targets investment in line with specific platforms or project types that have been identified as a priority for tourists on the basis of research. Under Fáilte Ireland's first platforms for growth investment scheme for immersive, heritage and cultural attractions, Westport House and Gardens was successful in an extremely competitive process. It was awarded an investment grant of €20.2 million in 2021 as part of a €36.1 million project to transform Westport House and Gardens into a world-class tourist attraction to enhance regional dispersal of visitors and extend the tourism season beyond the traditional summer months. The proposed restoration, reimagining and rewilding at Westport House and Gardens estate will offer visitors a multilayered, multi-day experience. A key element is the wild realms project, which will allow visitors to connect with nature and explore ancient Irish rituals and our ancestors' connections to the land, as told through a series of accessible wild and natural spaces. In 2021 also, the second platforms for growth scheme was announced. This investment scheme, developed in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities, will support the local economy and the outdoor activity sector by significantly enhancing the overall visitor experience, providing new business opportunities in local communities. This funding is to be used to develop world-class facilities at 22 locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction, including Achill Island and Louisburgh in County Mayo. These facilities, designed to serve as a hub in each locality from which multiple water-sports operators can base themselves, will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We must also take into consideration the two years we have had with the pandemic. As I said, the €20.2 million in Westport House was Fáilte Ireland's largest investment ever in a singular tourism product. Funding was also awarded to Mayo County Council to develop the two state-of-the-art facilities to which I referred. Mayo County Council was also a successful applicant for the outdoor dining enhancement scheme, with Claremorris and Castlebar receiving funds. The Clew Bay destination experience development plan, which was launched on 19 November 2021, sets out an ambitious vision for the region over the next three to five years. That was developed over a period of three years with robust consultation. We have to take into consideration the two years we had but there is no doubt that County Mayo is being developed. There is ambition for this beautiful part of the country, and rightly so.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Fáilte Ireland indicated at the time that it would consider a second round but the current focus is on delivering the first round. A second round has not been ruled out, however. At a regional local level, Fáilte Ireland develops, supports and promotes tourism in line with the relevant tourism experience brands. To guide medium to long-term development, Fáilte Ireland aims to deliver four new regional tourism strategies in 2022, which will set out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for each region. At a more local level, the four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans developed by Fáilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. I can get the Deputy further information on a second scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ireland's well-being framework is the result of a programme for Government commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring. The overarching vision for the framework is enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future. The framework is a cross-government initiative, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach and jointly sponsored by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. The second report on Ireland's well-being framework, Understanding Life in Ireland: A Well-being Framework, was published on 2 June. This report sets out an updated well-being framework for Ireland, which has 11 dimensions of well-being as well as sustainability and equality as cross-cutting themes. With regard to language and culture, which were raised by the Deputy, Ireland's well-being framework is similar to comparative international well-being frameworks. The 11 dimensions allow for a multidimensional approach to monitoring Irish society and the consideration of language and culture takes place across a number of the dimensions. Cultural identity and language issues are considered as part of the dimension entitled civic engagement, trust and cultural expression, which includes an aspect of cultural expression, identity and non-discrimination. This dimension explores a person's rights to express his or her identity, for example, activities relating to specific groups such as traditional Irish communities, including Gaeltacht communities, as well as the cultural practices and expression of migrant or new Irish. It also includes the ability to express one's culture or identity or celebrate one's native language, placing a particular emphasis on the Irish language. In addition, individual cultural participation is recognised as part of personal time in the time use dimension. Similarly, the social aspect of participating in community groups like artistic or creative groups and sporting clubs is captured in the community and cultural participation aspect of the connections, community and participation dimension. The role of culture and language in the assessment of our collective well-being is very important to me. In this context, the Deputy may be interested to know that officials in my Department have begun early research with a view to developing a sectoral well-being indicator set relating to arts, culture, creativity, sport and language over the coming months. Such indicator sets will allow more detailed analysis of specific sectors with linkages to the high-level well-being dashboard which, by nature, cannot cover every area in detail.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I firmly believe that culture and language are vital for our well-being in Ireland. This was clearly demonstrated particularly with regard to culture during the Covid-19 pandemic, and I will continue to make this clear to my colleagues in the Government. The Deputy referred to Wales. A key lesson, too, is that it is an iterative process requiring patience, commitment and planning, as the embedding process takes time. For example, in New Zealand, which the Deputy referenced in his initial question, there is the inclusion of a specific, additional dimension on culture related to the demography of the country and the Maori culture specifically. In the case of Ireland's well-being framework, culture, both in terms of identity and participation, has been explicitly integrated into the dimensions of well-being. My officials and the Department are currently giving detailed consideration to how we can use data to allow us to measure well-being. I am grateful for the Deputy's contribution and for his ideas with regard to what is being done in Wales. That is something my officials are looking at too. We have to identify indicators across the sectors in my Department for capturing data that will assist us in measuring well-being for evidence-based policy development.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will enjoy that at the weekend. A tourism recovery task force was established in May 2020 and delivered a tourism recovery plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector could adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment. Later that year, I appointed a recovery oversight group to oversee the implementation of this plan. This group has reported regularly to me and has provided valuable inputs to the Government on the measures required to assist the sector. The recovery oversight group is continuing its work and will report to me with updates on implementation of the tourism recovery plan and recovery in the sector more generally. Looking to the longer term, my Department has initiated the development of a sustainable tourism policy. The development of this new policy will involve consultation with the tourism industry and with communities to help set out a path for the coming years which will support sustainable recovery and growth in the sector. In budget 2022, €288.5 million was allocated for tourism services. This allows for significant increases in domestic and overseas marketing in building a strong digital presence for the sector and in developing new and enhanced visitor experiences that will drive sustainable and dispersed visitor growth. I have referred the Deputy's question to Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland for further details of their specific plans to help the tourism sector to recover in 2022 and beyond. A significant challenge facing the sector at present is the recruitment and retention of staff. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages. A key task in this regard is to drive the long-term repositioning of the sector as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace. As we enter the peak summer months and the tourism industry recovers, there are inevitably additional pressures on hotel capacity and pricing. The initial recovery phase has resulted in issues for all tourism businesses, many of which are repeated in other markets around the world. Hotel supply in Dublin has been affected by a range of factors. Some of them are short-term, such as deferred business from the last two years and increased demand. Businesses are also facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors, all of which have contributed to higher prices than in 2019. International supply chains are impacting on the car rental fleet. While this is not in the control of the Government and there are no short-term solutions, my Department is examining possible taxation options which might assist, with the recognition that taxation measures are a matter for the Minister for Finance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the hotel prices the Deputy mentioned, my officials have engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Conferation, ITIC, and the IHF. They are also working with the tourism agencies. The Tánaiste and I co-chair a tourism and hospitality forum. That will be convening next week and we will raise those issues with it. I wrote to the DAA at the time, although it is not under my remit. I could see the potential and I wrote to express my concerns about the reputational damage to Ireland as a tourism destination as we seek to rebuild. Regarding car rental, I am aware of the difficulties and the potential impact on the recovery of the tourism sector or the reputational damage. My officials have met the Car Rental Council of Ireland, which recommends that people can contact hire companies directly. However, neither my Department nor Fáilte Ireland has control over prices set by service providers in the tourism industry.We have no regulatory or other functions in regard to the car rental industry. Each operator decides on its level of charges, having regard to its costs and the requirement to make an adequate return on its investment. My Department is examining possible taxation options which might assist car rental companies to rebuild their fleet in order to meet tourism demands, while recognising that taxation matters are ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the smooth running of Dublin Airport is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of the tourism sector. The DAA has the statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening at the airport. The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling far short of the service that citizens and visitors should expect at our largest State airport. The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, continue to hold meetings with the CEO, Dalton Philips, and his management team in this regard. From a tourism perspective, I am concerned. If this situation were to continue, it has the potential to cause significant reputational damage to the country abroad, and as a result hinder the recovery of the tourism sector. That is the reason I wrote to Dalton Philips to express my concern. In his reply, he outlined some key measures being rolled out, which aim to substantially mitigate the risk of a repeat of recent days. My time is short, but I can send the communication to the Deputy. I am informed that regular meetings will continue with the DAA at ministerial level with the Department of Transport until the Minister is satisfied that difficulties persisting at the airport are satisfactorily resolved. I will keep in contact with the Minister and Minister of State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My Department runs an annual small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme. The scheme is reserved for appropriate not-for-profit festivals, summer schools and other such similar events. Funding available under this scheme is typically capped at €5,000. Although making available relatively modest amounts, the value of the payments under this scheme is amplified hugely by the community commitment and voluntary effort that bring about these events, which are greatly enjoyed and appreciated around the country. The scheme is intended to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other central government moneys and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by Fáilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. Events that are funded by the Arts Council and Fáilte Ireland are not eligible. The projects make a very important contribution to the development and promotion of Ireland's cultural tourism offering, to the benefit of both the domestic and foreign tourist market, and represent an important component of the delivery of the cultural tourism commitments in the programme for Government. I am very conscious of the special efforts being made this year by event organisers and promoters to re-establish their annual arrangements, which have been suspended for two years because of Covid. Tremendous efforts were made by many to continue their programmes with online presentations while public gatherings were not possible. Some of these initiatives may be carried forward to strengthen outreach and inclusion. However, the calendar of local festivals and shared celebration is a vital element of community life and cultural expression, and I am pleased to be able to support the recovery efforts through this scheme. The closing date for applications for the 2022 scheme was 23 April. The applications are being assessed in the Department and the decision will be announced imminently. The Deputy may be interested to know that from the introduction of this scheme in 2017 up to 2021, a total of €393,611 has been awarded to eligible events. In that period, 22 applications for events in County Mayo were approved for payments amounting to €59,000. Four applications were received this year from County Mayo in respect of the small local festivals and summer schools scheme 2022.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with Deputy Dillon that festivals are of great significance to communities, even more so now after two years of being deprived of the festivals. The 2022 allocation has been capped at €5,000. The announcement is imminent for the 2022 allocation, which remains as it is. Although the scheme is capped, it is working in that it has a massive impact on local communities. There are no plans in train to increase the allocation. The current scheme, which is capped at €5,000, will be announced very shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Heritage, tradition and culture are not the exclusive preserve of a few, nor to be found only within institutions. These festivals are essential to community life. They thrive and develop among people shaped by their diverse interests and enthusiasms. I am very pleased to provide supports for such events. Other supports are provided by my Department. We also operate schemes to support links and strengthen exchanges in relation to culture, heritage and history with counterpart groups in Northern Ireland. Completing our suite of small grant schemes, there are two others that are worthy of mention: the scheme supporting the mobility in Ireland of the collections of the national cultural institutions and the scheme supporting the development of regional and local museums. I place particular importance on these schemes because they are of significant value to the community activities that they support. My officials will get back to the Deputy on any other issues or ideas he has raised.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The past two years have provided unprecedented challenges for this country and the coalition Government has risen to these challenges and lead the country through these turbulent times. An extensive range of funding streams and measures to support the sector overseen by my Department have been introduced. The tourism and hospitality sectors felt the brunt of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. In response, record levels of financial supports for those sectors have been provided, as well as the extension of the reduced 9% VAT rate into 2023. This has kept businesses afloat, kept people in jobs and maintained vibrancy in our communities. New measures to promote a thriving night-time economy are now being implemented, including more late night openings and new funding for acts in cafes and bars across Ireland. This and more will breathe life into our communities. The basic income for the arts pilot scheme has been launched. It is a landmark initiative that recognises the intrinsic value of our artistic and creative sectors. I look forward to continuing to oversee the implementation of the scheme, with first payments to go out to the 2,000 selected recipients in the coming weeks. The Official Languages Act 2021 to provide Irish was signed into law by the President late last year. Tá ullmhú an phlean náisiúnta ag teacht le cuspóir foriomlán an Achta a bhaint amach; is é sin gur cainteoirí Gaeilge a bheas in 20% de na hearcaigh nua chun na seirbhíse poiblí, tráth nach déanaí ná deireadh mhí na Nollag 2030. More than €150 million was allocated to the sports capital and equipment programme to support 1,900 groups, large and small, across the country. This was the most funding ever allocated under the scheme. Last night, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 passed Report Stage in the Seanad. Huge work has gone into this significant legislation to reduce harmful content online and bring an end to the era of self-regulation. Just earlier today we launched the report of the Future of Media Commission and announced a major Government initiative to support Ireland's media sector.This Government is making incredible progress on climate action, equality, transport, integration, biodiversity and in many other areas. We absolutely must keep our focus on implementing the climate action plan, setting the country on a pathway to halve our emissions by 2030. Now is not the time to risk putting all this progress into jeopardy. Now is the time to knuckle down and continue to make the real, transformational change this coalition Government is making to improve the lives of people. Families and communities across the country do not want instability after a pandemic and during a time of war. People want stability. They want progress. This coalition will continue to deliver on its promises. Tá mo mhuinín agus mo thacaíocht ag an Rialtas
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move:"Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois."Dlí ceannródaioch is ea é an Bille um Rialail Sábháilteachta ar Line agus na Meán agus tá áthas orm é a chur faoi bhráid an Tí. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is ambitious, comprehensive and wide-ranging media legislation. It will be the first major overhaul of the Broadcasting Act 2009 since that Act was last considered by this House. Since that time, there has been a dramatic transformation in how we consume content, whether on television, radio or by way of services offered over the Internet. This transformation has been made possible by new technologies, in particular the widespread availability of smartphones and broadband services. The most radical aspect of this transformation has been the vast amount of user-generated content that is now created by people across the world and made available online. The rise of online services has allowed new ways for people to communicate with one other and new outlets for creativity and self-expression. However, with these new benefits come new risks, particularly for our children. Some of those risks are an extension of existing dangers, such as bullying and harassment, to a new environment in which they can be magnified.Others, such as image-based abuse, represent a new challenge.  This Government is determined to confront these risks by bringing an end to the era of self-regulation. For the first time in Irish law, this Bill creates a regulatory framework for online safety, in which online services will be held to account when the public, and children in particular, are not appropriately shielded from harmful online content. The Bill also provides for the modernisation of the regulation of broadcasting services and video-on-demand services. This is essential in light of the significant expansion of video-on-demand services and the need for better alignment of the regulation of those services with broadcasters to ensure a level playing field and consistent application of media regulation. Prior to detailing the key elements of the Bill, I will briefly update the House regarding the infringement proceedings in respect of the revised audiovisual media services directive. On 19 May 2022, the European Commission decided to refer Ireland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failure to meet the transposition deadline for this directive. Unfortunately, this is likely to result in the imposition of significant financial penalties. I am aware this House needs no additional motivation to progress this legislation, but I note this development reinforces the need to get this Bill enacted swiftly. I sincerely thank the Seanad and the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for their intensive scrutiny of this legislation to date. I am proud to have been participating as Minister in the interesting and thought-provoking debates we have had, and will have, on this ground-breaking legislation. Prior to giving a more structured overview of this Bill, I will first speak about some of its most important provisions. First, Part 3 provides for the creation of coimisiún na meán, a regulatory body which will be responsible for implementing and enforcing online safety and media regulation. To do so, an coimisiún will have a robust and modern suite of regulatory functions and powers in line with EU law and best practice. Of fundamental importance will be its independence in the exercise of those functions and powers. The powers of an coimisiún include the power to fund its operations by levying regulated services, create legally-binding regulatory codes, gather information and appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations and the power to seek the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance, including financial sanctions of up to €20 million or 10% of the turnover of the non-compliant service provider, whichever is higher. While the functions of an coimisiún primarily relate to the regulation of services, it will also have wider roles in respect of the protection of children, research, education, media literacy and journalistic and creative supports. As provided for in the transitional provisions at Part 16, coimisiún na meán will also take over the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. This includes the transfer of the staff of the authority to an coimisiún. I envisage that an coimisiún will need to scale up quickly to a staffing level of at least 160 people and in the longer term may require a staffing complement of up to 300 people. This scaling-up process will be particularly important following the Digital Services Act coming into effect because the Government has decided that an coimisiún will be designated as the digital services co-ordinator for the purposes of the Act's implementation. Given the importance of an coimisiún, the Government approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. In this regard, an extensive programme of work is under way with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit corporate and senior staff and to lay the groundwork for an effective regulatory environment. The posts of executive chairperson, the online safety commissioner and the media development commissioner are being recruited through open, transparent and public competitions. Each post was advertised by the PAS in July and it is also now managing the next stages of the competitions, which are expected to be concluded by November. While it was always the intention to appoint an online safety commissioner, as demonstrated by the ongoing recruitment process, to highlight the importance of the role and to provide certainty to stakeholders, and in light of relevant discussions in the Seanad, I brought forward an amendment to explicitly provide for the position in the Bill on Report Stage in the Upper House. As I mentioned, perhaps the most significant matter for an coimisiún to address will be the regulation of certain online services in respect of user-generated content. This legislation provides for a regulatory framework for online safety in Part 11. Through this framework, the online safety commissioner will tackle the availability of harmful online content. Regarding the online services which may be regulated in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive, the Bill firstly requires an coimisiún to designate video-sharing platform services for regulation. An coimisiún may also designate further online services which facilitate access to user-generated content for regulation. This will encompass a wide range of services, including social media services and many gaming, online messaging and storage services. To designate a service, an coimisiún must conduct a risk assessment. This will include consideration of various factors, such as the nature and scale of the service and the risk of exposure to harmful online content. This risk-based approach will enable an coimisiún to direct its energies and resources to the areas where they are most needed. Once an online service has been designated for regulation, an coimisiún can require it to comply with binding online safety codes. These codes can require online services to adapt their systems and processes in three key areas: in rules for content moderation and complaints handling; in rules regarding the design of a service and how and why it displays certain content to users; and in rules about commercial communications, including advertising. The main aim of the codes is to tackle and progressively reduce the availability of harmful online content on designated online services. The Bill clearly defines "harmful online content". Online content is harmful where it relates to one of the 40 criminal offences listed in section 45 of the Bill or cyberbullying, or promotes or encourages eating disorders, self-harm or suicide or makes available knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide. The schedule of criminal offences includes, for example, those under Coco's law, that is, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, regarding image-based abuse, abuse of communications and harassment. For harmful online content not related to an existing criminal offence, cyberbullying material for instance, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful. This includes consideration of whether the online content gives rise to any risk to a person's life or a reasonably foreseeable risk to a person's mental or physical health. The Bill also provides for a mechanism, which is subject to Oireachtas oversight, for future categories of harmful online content to be brought within its scope. In summary, the online safety elements of this Bill will ensure that an individual will be exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made. In this regard, an coimisiún will have significant powers of compliance and sanction to hold these services to account. In the context of online safety, it is important to mention the work of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism. I brought its report to Government yesterday. As Members may be aware, the expert group was tasked with examining the potential legal and practical issues involved. It has backed the feasibility of establishing such a mechanism but only if certain key factors and dependencies are addressed. As an example of those dependencies, the expert group emphasised the importance of allowing appropriate time for the systemic forms of regulation relating to complaints to bed in before phasing in the mechanism. In particular, the report emphasises that an individual complaints mechanism would not be workable or effective without systemic online safety regulation being in place. As part of the report, the expert group included draft heads which provide for an individual complaints mechanism within the Bill. These draft heads have been provided to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for detailed drafting and it is my intention, subject to Government approval, to bring forward the resulting amendments on Committee Stage. I thank once more the members of the expert group for their report and comprehensive consideration of the issues at play regarding the feasibility of an individual complaints mechanism in the context of this legislation. Additionally, regarding the individual complaints mechanism, the recommendation of the expert group is to first deal with harmful online content that targets children. Regarding the regulation of broadcasting and streaming services, this will primarily be done through media service codes and media service rules, the provisions for which are set out at Part 5. Media service codes are mostly about the content of programming, including rules for programme standards and advertising. Media service rules, on the other hand, are mostly about the presentation and structure of the service, including rules regarding the time given to advertising, accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities and quotas for European works.To ensure the uninterrupted regulation of broadcasters, the transitional provisions at Part 16 provide for the existing broadcasting codes and rules to be carried over and to become media service codes and rules. Part 5 also provides for the mandatory registration of streaming services to ensure that, in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive, all streaming services established in Ireland are subject to appropriate regulation. Broadcasters will remain regulated on a contractual basis, as is set out in the current Broadcasting Act 2009. The Bill also provides for the transposition of an optional provision in the directive which will empower an coimisiún to levy broadcasters and streaming services, including those established elsewhere in the EU, in respect of any revenues that they may make in Ireland in order to fund the production of European work, including Irish-produced works. Provision is made so that the money collected may be disbursed by an coimisiún through a content production scheme. The Bill does not set the amounts of any such levy as this would be inflexible but enables an coimisiún to design and implement a levy having regard to relevant economic factors. There are potential risks and benefits to a levy, including for consumers, and it is intended that an coimisiún would thoroughly examine these matters before these provisions are commenced. At this point, I would like to acknowledge the importance of media development and sustainability and note the constructive engagement I had last week with the joint committee and the Seanad on the report and recommendations of the Future of Media Commission. While legislation separate from this Bill will be brought forward to progress the implementation of the Future of Media Commission recommendations, the appointment of a media development commissioner, who will work in tandem with the broadcasting commissioner, will be key to the successful implementation of those recommendations. I reiterate my gratitude to Members of the Seanad for their extensive consideration of the Bill. Productive engagement with Senators led to 62 Government amendments being brought forward on Report Stage. In the interests of time, I will not go through each amendment but will highlight a few of them. They included amendments to require an coimisiún to establish a youth advisory committee; an amendment to require coimisiún na meán to promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by communications media operating in the State; and amendments to explicitly expand the educational remit of coimisiún na meán, including to provide that an coimisiún can engage with community, local and sorting bodies in awareness raising, training and education. In addition, I note that there were certain issues raised by Senators which I committed to returning to in the Dáil following a period of further consideration. I am still considering some of those issues with a view to potentially bringing amendments on Committee Stage, including in relation to the operation of a potential content production levy and content production scheme, as well as amendments in relation to media service codes and rules regarding defining party political broadcasts and the time given over to political parties during electoral periods. I also intend to bring forward a number of other amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil. These are primarily technical in nature and include consequential amendments in light of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022, amendments to clarify the nature of the territorial scope of content limitation notices, amendments to clarify that local broadcasters will be able to apply for funding under the scheme for professional journalistic practices and amendments to clarify the application of the provisions providing for the prominence of public service content. Turning to a more structured overview of the provisions of the Bill, it is, first, important to note that this Bill amends the Broadcasting Act 2009. Part 1 addresses preliminary and general matters. Part 2 amends the 2009 Act to insert and amend a number of definitions to support the operation of the Bill. Part 3 amends Part 2 of the 2009 Act to provide for the establishment of coimisiún na meán. Key aspects of this Part include provision for the independence of an coimisiún; for the appointment of commissioners; for an coimisiún to impose levies on regulated services, excluding community broadcasters, to fund its operations; and for the accountability of the chairperson to the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairperson and other commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees. Part 3 also provides for the high-level powers and functions of an coimisiún. These include upholding Ireland's democratic values; protecting the interests of the public, in particular, children; ensuring the diverse needs of the people of this island are served by our media; and sustaining independent and impartial journalism. Part 4 provides for matters related to the registration of providers of streaming services through the insertion of a new Part 3A into the 2009 Act. Part 5 concerns the duties, codes and rules applicable to radio and television broadcasters and streaming services and provides for these through the insertion of a new Part 3B into the 2009 Act. Chapter 2 of this new Part concerns duties on those services. Chapters 3 and 5 of this new Part concern media codes and rules. Chapter 3 of this Part also provides that existing broadcasting codes and rules made by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will continue in force following the enactment of the Bill. Part 6 amends Part 4 of the 2009 Act and primarily concerns changes to take into account the establishment of an coimisiún and the statutory regulation of streaming services in respect of redress mechanisms. Part 9 amends Part 7 of the 2009 Act to, among other things, take into account the establishment of an coimisiún in relation to public service broadcasting, provide for changes to the calculation of total advertising time for broadcasters and insert a new Chapter 7 regarding the availability and prominence of public service programmes and services. Part 11 inserts a new Part 8A into the 2009 Act concerning online safety regulation. Chapter 1 of this new Part concerns the definitions of harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content. Chapter 2 concerns the process for designating relevant online for regulation. Chapter 3 concerns the making of online safety codes, the matters which they can address and matters which need to be taken into account when the codes are being drawn up. Chapter 4 concerns the making of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices. Chapter 5 concerns an obligation on an coimisiún to establish a super-complaints scheme for nominated bodies and a number of other matters. Part 11 also inserts a new Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act containing the list of offence-specific categories of harmful online content. Part 12 inserts a new Part 8B into the 2009 Act concerning investigations and sanctions. Chapter 2 of this new Part provides an coimisiún with the power to appoint authorised officers and sets out procedures for investigations by those officers and for decisions by an coimisiún following investigations. Chapter 4 concerns the imposition of administrative financial sanctions. Chapter 5 of this new Part provides an coimisiún with the power to issue notices to end a contravention and provides for secondary criminal liability for senior executives. Chapter 6 provides an coimisiún with the power to seek court orders to block access to non-compliant online services in Ireland. Chapter 7 provides an coimisiún with the power to issue content limitation notices in respect of individual items of harmful online content. Chapter 8 of this new Part provides for three categories of summary offences under the Bill and provides an coimisiún with the power to prosecute these offences. This Part also creates a new Schedule concerning oral hearings. Parts 7, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 17 amend various Parts of the 2009 Act and other relevant Acts to take into account the dissolution of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the establishment of an coimisiún. Part 14 inserts a new Part 10A into the 2009 Act concerning European works. This Part provides for the requirements of the directive for European works quotas and prominence and provides an coimisiún with the power to introduce a European works levy and European works scheme. Lastly, Part 16 provides for transitional matters. As can be seen, this Bill is, given its subject matter, necessarily multifaceted and wide-ranging. It deals with a wide range of important issues from modernising media regulation to, for the first time, introducing online safety regulation to tackle the availability of serious forms of harmful online content. I look forward to Members' contributions and to engaging further during the course of their scrutiny of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Members of the House for their valuable contributions. The level of engagement during pre-legislative scrutiny and legislative scrutiny here and in the Seanad has been most welcome and of considerable benefit in ensuring this Bill meets our needs, both today and in the future. I apologise to the members of Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for the delay in sharing the report of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism. This was an unfortunate and unintentional administrative oversight, especially as the committee was so involved in the work that led to my decision to establish the committee. Members have raised a range of important issues. While I cannot address them all today, I will briefly respond to a number of points. Deputies Munster and Mythen raised the issue of Oireachtas oversight of the activities of coimisiún na meán. The Bill as it stands contains numerous provisions relating to Oireachtas oversight, including the direct accountability of the executive chairperson and the commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees. However, as legislators we must be mindful that an coimisiún will be an independent regulator, as required by EU law. As such, it will be responsible for carrying out its day-to-day activities, subject to Oireachtas oversight. For example, regulatory codes such as media codes, media rules and online safety codes will be subject to negative resolution procedures before these Houses. Deputies Munster, Mythen, Kelly, Cannon, Kenny and Patricia Ryan raised the issue of appropriately resourcing coimisiún na meán, including with expert staff. At present, the recruitment process for the roles of executive chairperson, online safety commissioner and media development commissioner is ongoing and is expected to conclude in November. Work is continuing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to finalise the estimated medium- and long-term staffing and resourcing requirements of an coimisiún. A key part of this is identifying the necessary expertise required by coimisiún na meán in order to fulfil its functions. In this regard, recruitment is expected to take place in tranches over a period of time following the appointment of the commissioners and the establishment of an coimisiún. I agree that there are specific skill sets required and that this is a rapidly changing environment. I am committed to supporting an coimisiún in delivering on its goals in this respect. Deputies Mythen, Ó Cathasaigh, Gould and Patricia Ryan raised the regulation of gambling. As Deputy Mythen noted, my colleague the Minister for Justice is in the process of bringing forward a Bill to establish a new gambling regulatory authority and, to that end, has recently recruited the CEO for that body.On Report Stage in the Seanad, I tabled a Government amendment to ensure that coimisiún na meán would work with this new body to strengthen both the regulation of gambling and media and online safety. I am confident that this approach will enable the two regulators to collaborate effectively in addressing their shared challenges. While freedom of expression is a key value and virtue of this House, Deputies Munster, Kelly, Cannon, Tully and Barry specifically raised concerns in relation to protecting freedom of expression and striking an appropriate balance of rights within the Bill. More specifically, a number of Members raised concerns in relation to section 46J(1)(a) which concerns duties on broadcasters and video on-demand services, including a duty not to broadcast or make available anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence. I must state that this provision is carried over from the 2009 Act and is currently a part of Irish law. However, during the Seanad debates on this Bill I committed to examining this issue further with a view to potentially tabling an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil and that is what I am presently doing. Therefore, I acknowledge the concerns that have been raised and I am examining them. Deputies Munster, Tully, Kelly and Gannon raised the working conditions of content moderators working for online platforms. While I agree that this is an important issue, it is a matter of employment law and is something that the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been examining. I will ask my officials to liaise with their colleagues in that Department on this matter. Deputies Munster, Kelly, Gannon, Kenny, Barry and James O’Connor raised the issue of disinformation, which is a significant and complex issue and requires a distinct and targeted response. At EU level it is being dealt with through the completed and strengthened code of practice on disinformation, which will be linked to the Digital Services Act. The Act will set out standards for platforms in dealing with this issue. Coimisiún na meán will ultimately be the main regulator for the Digital Services Act in Ireland. Therefore, this is how we plan to regulate operationally for disinformation in Ireland, bulwarked by the EU code of practice. In addition to this, my Department is planning to establish a working group, comprising relevant Departments, agencies and key stakeholders, including the European Digital Media Observatory hub at Dublin City University, to progress the recommendation of the Future of Media Commission to create a national counter disinformation strategy in order to complement the work of the EU in tackling disinformation. A number of Deputies raised matters relating to media sustainability. In this regard, Deputies Canney and Michael Collins raised issues in relation to local radio, including access by local radio stations to the journalism bursary provided in the Bill. I can confirm that I intend to propose an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil to ensure local radio stations have access to the bursary.  In relation to a potential content production levy and scheme, it is intended that this levy will be introduced by an coimisiún subject to an assessment of its viability and of whether it would have any negative effects. This is because there are risks as well as benefits for the Irish audiovisual sector in the introduction of a levy. Some stakeholders have asked whether I would set out the exact percentages of and process of the levy in the legislation. I think that such an approach would be inflexible and that an coimisiún, as an independent body, should have the power to design and enforce the levy and to change it over time. I expect that an examination of the content production levy will be among the priorities of an coimisiún upon its establishment. Deputy Higgins raised the question of algorithms. Online safety codes made by the online safety commissioner can address the use of algorithms to deliver, recommend and moderate online content. This is key to this systemic framework to regulate online platforms and to tackle the availability of harmful online content. Deputy Pringle raised issue of private messaging services. These services are covered by the Bill but only in respect of offence-specific online content of which there are 40 categories linked to existing criminal offences. This means that coimisiún na meán can set out obligations for these services through online safety codes for how they address this type of content. This includes standards for complaints handling, reporting requirements and technical mechanisms to reduce the availability of such content. Deputy James O'Connor raised the educational role of coimisiún na meán. The online safety commissioner will have a role in carrying out educational initiatives, such as public information campaigns, and will work with existing educational bodies such as the Department of Education through webwise.ie and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. An coimisiún will also be empowered to work with local, community and sporting bodies on training and educational initiatives, including media literacy and online safety. The commissioner will also be able to endorse third-party providers of online safety educational materials which will help schools to source appropriate and robust online safety materials. There have been some suggestions that an coimisiún should have a role in accrediting certain educational materials. I would not consider it appropriate for this regulatory body to overstep into the field of professional accreditation, but I think a good balance is struck by allowing the endorsement of such materials and allowing the delivery of educational initiatives and the provision of support to educational bodies.  I thank the Members of the House for their engagement with this vital legislation. While it is complex and expansive, it is necessary. In this regard, a number of Members have raised concerns that the Bill is too large. I take a different view. The Bill is comprehensive and sets out regulatory frameworks for media and online safety which are responsive and adaptable to changing circumstances. In our fast-paced, information-driven era, this is sorely needed. I know that a number of Members intend to table amendments to the Bill as it passes through this House. In this regard, my officials are available to meet with any Deputy who intends to introduce amendments in order to tease out any issues that may arise.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(a) and 181(1). Question put and agreed to.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." Dlí tábhachtach is ea an An Bille um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta (An Ceoláras Náisiúnta) (Leasú), 2022 agus tá áthas orm é a chur faoi bhráid an Tí. The purpose of the Bill before this House is to put the necessary legal framework in place to support the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. This legislation represents a critical step forward for the National Concert Hall as Ireland’s national cultural institution for music. It will also cement the role of the National Symphony Orchestra within that institution, formalising and enhancing the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall. When the National Concert Hall was officially launched by President Patrick Hillery on 9 September 1981, the symphony orchestra performed the inaugural concert with a programme that included Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and the premiere of Seóirse Bodley’s Ceol: Symphony No 3. Since that time, the NSO has been the resident orchestra at the concert hall and its Friday night concerts are an important fixture in the classical music calendar and a central pillar of the concert hall’s annual programme. The NSO has long been a primary force in Irish musical life, with live performances of symphonic, choral and operatic music as well as popular and traditional music, new commissions, recordings and broadcasts on RTÉ and abroad through the European Broadcasting Union. The symphony orchestra has also toured widely, both nationally and internationally, to great acclaim. Despite these successes, the NSO has been faced with a number of operational challenges over the past number of years. The symphony orchestra was founded by RTÉ in 1948, at a time when there was intense demand for broadcast orchestral music. In those days, public service broadcasters tended to create their own orchestras to satisfy demand, which was more flexible and cost-effective than hiring external orchestras for recording. Since then, however, the nature of media and its consumption have been utterly transformed, which is something that I am currently addressing more broadly through the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. With respect to the orchestra, it has become clear in recent times that it could no longer reach its full potential within the administrative and financial structures of a public service broadcaster.In response to the challenges faced by the orchestra, RTÉ commissioned a report from consultant Helen Boaden of Mediatique, a strategic advisory firm specialising in the media and communications industries, to review its two orchestras, the NSO and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, and to provide recommendations for their future structure, activities and funding. The report was published in April 2018 and its main recommendation was that the NSO should either become a national cultural institution in its own right or be positioned within the National Concert Hall, NCH, and funded directly by the Government. The report also proposed that the NSO should be restored to its historical levels of staffing and activity, to include regional performances and educational programmes. Given the vital role of the orchestra and the choirs in the Irish musical landscape, this Government has shown its commitment by working with the orchestra, the concert hall and RTÉ to effect the changes envisaged in the Boaden report and to ensure that the orchestra is supported into the future by effecting a transfer to the NCH, our national cultural institution for music. Getting to this stage has taken significant time, resources and commitment from all involved, including the players and staff of the orchestra, the concert hall team, RTÉ and Government Departments. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the engagement, effort and vision of the individuals and bodies involved. Without that commitment, we would not find ourselves here today considering this Bill, we would not have the NSO embedded within our national cultural institution for music and we would not be looking at a bright future for the orchestra at full strength in its long-term home at the NCH. Over the past four years, the Government has considered this matter on a number of occasions. In July 2018, following the publication of the Boaden report, the then Ministers for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Communications, Climate Action and Environment brought proposals to the Government regarding the future of the NSO. At that meeting, the Government agreed that the NSO should be brought within the concert hall’s remit and authorised the initiation of discussions on the implementation of the report’s recommendations under the aegis of an oversight group. At the same time, the Department commissioned a report that estimated the full operating costs of the orchestra to be approximately €8 million per annum. In response, my Department immediately established the oversight group and an associated working group with RTÉ and the NCH to look at all the issues relating to the proposed transfer. These groups featured representatives from the orchestra, the choirs, RTÉ, the NCH and the unions. During the consultation process, it was agreed that the three RTÉ choirs, the RTÉ Philharmonic Choir, RTÉ Cór Linn and RTÉ Cór na nÓg, should also transfer from RTÉ to the NCH with the NSO, given the complementary and collaborative nature of their work. Along with the orchestra, the choirs are provided for in the Bill before the House today.  As part of the consultation process, the Department also engaged a financial consultant to provide one-to-one advice on pensions and benefits to all of the transferring employees. Following this extensive period of engagement, all queries relating to the employees’ terms and conditions and pension entitlements were fully addressed. Having completed all of the consultation and preparatory work with the agreement of all of the principals involved, the Government approved the transfer of the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH with effect from 24 January 2022. The Government also approved the drafting of the Bill before the House today to ensure a robust legislative underpinning for the concert hall incorporating the functions of the orchestra and choirs.  In tandem with the drafting of this Bill, the transfer of the NSO from RTÉ to the NCH took place on an administrative basis on 24 January of this year. This transfer was effected by contractual agreement between RTÉ and the NCH, and on the advice that sections 7 and 9 of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015 were broad enough to include the transfer of the NSO as part of the wider function of the NCH to promote and support the performance of music. The transfer also complied with transfer of undertakings and protection of employment, TUPE, provisions in that transferring members of the NSO and choirs were guaranteed to retain the terms and conditions they enjoyed in RTÉ. It is not enough just to transfer the NSO to the NCH. I am committed to seeing the orchestra return to full strength and take its place at the heart of Irish music and cultural life. I want the orchestra and choirs not only to survive, but to flourish. To that end, I am pleased to inform the House that, since transferring to the concert hall, the NSO has been in the process of being restored to its full playing strength. Over the last several months, my Department has sanctioned the NCH to fill a number of vacant positions within the orchestra and choirs. This includes three section leaders, a music librarian, a principal bass trombone and a percussion section leader, all of which are permanent positions. The National Concert Hall is now in the process of recruiting for these roles, ensuring that the artistic vision for the orchestra is another step closer to being realised. The task of restoring the NSO also necessitates investment in the orchestra's capital infrastructure. It has recently come to my attention that some of the orchestra’s musical instruments are no longer fit for purpose and require replacement. My Department is now making a substantial capital investment in the orchestra’s equipment with the purchase of a range of instruments. This investment in world-class instruments will ensure that the NSO can operate to the rigorous standards required of international orchestras. Given the long-standing collaboration between the two, I am delighted that the choirs have joined the orchestra in transferring. The philharmonic choir has since been renamed the National Symphony Chorus in recognition of this historic relationship. This choir was established in 1985 and is made up of volunteer singers who rehearse on a weekly basis. The children’s choir, Cór na nÓg, was founded in 1987 and comprises children aged ten and older who perform on special occasions including new year's day celebrations. Cór Linn, which was formed in 2018, is made up of young singers aged 15 to 20 and serves as a bridge between the other two choirs. Cór Linn rehearses together weekly and performs a wide and varied repertoire from classical to pop. I take this opportunity to recognise the remarkable contribution of these three choirs to Irish music, much of which is undertaken on a voluntary basis. It is wonderful to see emerging musical talent being developed in such a considered way. All of this investment is taking place within the overall redevelopment of the NCH as part of the implementation of this Government’s national development plan. With the Office of Public Works, the concert hall has developed exciting plans for the redevelopment of the Earlsfort Terrace site which I hope to bring to the Government shortly. The redevelopment plans will enable the NCH to meet the needs of 21st century performing artists and audiences. The works will include a new state-of-the-art main auditorium, world-class stage facilities for visiting musicians and resident organisations and artists, increased availability of creative spaces for the next generation of composers and musicians and new public facilities for audiences. This journey of consultation, transfer and investment has brought us to today and the presentation of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022 to this House. At the outset, I acknowledge the contribution of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media in its examination of the general scheme of Bill. Following meetings between my officials and the committee about the content and intention of the Bill, the committee opted not to undertake prelegislative scrutiny and, therefore, no recommendations have been made for incorporation into the Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to update the legislation for the NCH to recognise the role and position of the NSO and choirs within the concert hall and, crucially, on its board. The Bill will bring the orchestra and choirs within the statutory framework of the concert hall and will also provide for appropriate reporting and accounting to me and onwards to the Oireachtas without impacting on their artistic freedom. The Bill also provides for the legal transfer of all undertakings related to the orchestra to the concert hall as well as amending the Broadcasting Act 2009 to reflect the transfer of the orchestra from RTÉ. I will now introduce the specific provisions of the Bill. The Bill is divided into four parts. Part 1 deals with general provisions such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the Bill. Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH. These provisions date from the transfer day of 24 January 2022. This Part amends the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015 by inserting a number of new sections into the principal Act. Section 4 provides for the transfer of functions relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH on the transfer day. It also provides for the transfer of any administration and business in the performance of those functions. Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 are technical in nature and provide for the transfer of all undertakings, staff, assets and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs to the National Concert Hall on the transfer day. Section 9 substitutes the name of the National Concert Hall for that of RTÉ in any legal proceedings relating to the orchestra or choirs while section 10 provides that every act done by RTÉ or the NCH in relation to the transfer prior to the commencement of this part shall be deemed valid and effectual for all purposes. Part 3 of the Bill sets out a number of amendments to the principal Act to reflect the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the everyday operation of the NCH. In this regard, the critical section is section 11, which amends section 7 of the principal Act by adding a new function, "to maintain and operate an orchestra and a choir", to the functions of the concert hall. Section 12 builds on this by including the orchestra as a core consideration in the corporate governance structures of the concert hall. It does this by amending section 10 of the principal Act to increase the membership of the board from eight members to nine. This additional board member is required in the legislation to have experience of and expertise in the development of orchestras. This provision is considered essential in ensuring that the appropriate expertise is present on the board at all times to support the work of the NSO and choirs. Following on from the increase in board members provided for in section 12, section 13 is a technical amendment to increase the quorum for board meetings from four to five. The final part of the Bill, Part 4, amends the functions of RTÉ as set out in section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 14 replaces RTÉ’s previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only. This reflects the current situation where RTÉ retains responsibility for the National Concert Orchestra, as recommended in the Boaden report. Although largely technical in nature, this Bill represents a very important step in the journey that the NSO, the NCH, RTÉ, myself and my colleagues have been on for the past number of years. It is the culmination of a broad commitment by everyone involved to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music. I would particularly like to thank the staff of both RTÉ and the NCH for all their co-operation and advice in preparation for the transfer. I also welcome the orchestra and choirs as they take their place within the hall.  In some ways, the Bill represents the end of one journey with the transfer of the orchestra and choirs but it is also the first step in a much more important journey, as we turn our minds to how to build and enhance the NSO and NCH to ensure they are fit for purpose in an evolving environment and are at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come. When President Hillery opened the NCH in 1981, he described it as "the realisation of a dream long cherished". This Bill brings that dream, shared by music and arts lovers nationwide, ever closer to reality. These have been challenging years for music in Ireland as the pandemic severely restricted our opportunities for live performances. During this time, the NCH and NSO have worked diligently to provide online and outdoor concerts, concerts with limited capacities, and other events. Even in the darkest days of the pandemic, they kept making music for people to enjoy. This Bill, I hope, supports that instinct to keep making music for people to enjoy. Mar a dúirt an tUachtarán ag Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann i mí Iúil:Lig dúinn ceiliúradh a dhéanamh ar cheol ... na hÉireann i ngach cruth a thagann sé, agus lig dúinn athcheangail a dhéanamh leis an gceol, agus an tábhacht atá ag baint le taispeántas beo agus muid ag ceiliúradh ár gcairdeas le chéile.As such, I am delighted to bring this Bill before the Dáil and I look forward to hearing the contributions throughout Second Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is an unusual situation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is great.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for their contributions today. I am heartened by the engagement we have seen on the Bill. The various issues raised will be considered further in the Department as the Bill makes its way through the House. Having reflected on the contributions, I note that this is a technical Bill which provides for the legislation underpinning the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. Its main provisions are to amend the functions of the National Concert Hall to include the management of an orchestra and choirs. It is an important recognition of the newly expanded remit of the National Concert Hall now that the National Symphony Orchestra and choirs have transferred to it and are operating fully within its administrative structures. Second, the Bill will ensure that the board of the National Concert Hall is enlarged to include an additional board member and that at least one of the members must have experience of and expertise in the development of orchestras. This is a most welcome development, as it will endow the board with the knowledge required to fully support the orchestra as it is restored to its full playing strength under the National Concert Hall. The Bill also contains standard provisions regarding the transfer of staff, property, liabilities and legal undertakings in regard to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. The Bill provides for an amendment to the statutory functions of RTÉ under the broadcasting Acts. RTÉ is no longer required to manage multiple orchestras, but rather just the RTÉ National Concert Orchestra. The transfer of the NSO and this Bill mark an important next step in delivering the National Concert Hall's vision of being an inspiring and world-renowned music destination, accessible to all and enriching the cultural landscape of Ireland. The NSO, as Ireland's premier orchestra, is central to delivering on this vision which, coupled with the ambitious redevelopment plans for the National Concert Hall under the national development plan, will see it transform into the pre-eminent centre for music in Ireland. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised concerns which I had somewhat addressed in my opening statement about staff. I have always recognised the need to build the staff up to full capacity. On the transfer, we had 54 musicians and nine ancillary staff, who moved from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. Since then, the National Concert Hall has worked diligently to begin the process of returning the orchestra to its full playing strength. In recent months my Department has sanctioned the filling of a number of vacant positions within the orchestra and choirs - the music librarian, six musician posts, namely, the orchestra leader and first violin, as well as section leaders for percussion, double bass, horns and timpani, as well as bass trombone principal, all of which are permanent positions. The National Concert Hall has also received sanction for 26 fixed-term guest musician contracts, and contract extensions for four choral co-ordinators along with the HR staff support for this increased recruitment activity. The National Concert Hall is now in the process of recruiting for these roles through specialist classical music recruitment channels, to ensure the artistic vision of the orchestra is another step closer to being realised. We will continue to support the orchestra and the National Concert Hall to recruit permanent positions in 2023 and beyond. In response to Deputy Ó Cathasaigh, the national well-being framework includes cultural expression as an important dimension of well-being. My Department, with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach are working together to identify new indicators to expand our understanding of culture and well-being in Ireland. Also in response to Deputy Ó Cathasaigh, bringing the NSO and the choirs within the National Concert Hall provides access to greater administrative support in terms of programming, outreach, marketing and in-person operation. This also includes proximity to several other musical organisations. Chamber Choir Ireland and the Irish Baroque Orchestra were mentioned by the Deputy. That will provide opportunities for collaboration and much-needed joined-up thinking. In terms of outreach, the Creative Youth element of the Creative Ireland programme is a key pillar of the next five years. It will bring investment from my Department and the Department of Education directly into schools across the country. As someone who taught in a DEIS school for 16 years, I understand the need to reach out and to give opportunities to be exposed to music of all genres but as Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, also the opportunity to have access to instruments and to play them. That is a sentiment I share. Creative Schools has reached more DEIS schools since I became Minister. Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Gannon, and possibly Deputy Boyd Barrett as well, spoke about outreach. The National Symphony Orchestra will be involved in the National Concert Hall education programmes in 2023. The National Concert Hall already has an extensive outreach programme. For example, events are organised in children's hospitals around the country, as well as programmes for audiences with dementia. There is significant opportunity in the redevelopment of the campus. There is a vision for further outreach and additional education programmes. The National Concert Hall redevelopment is a flagship project in my Department. I envisage increased public access to music performances and programmes. To respond to Deputy Ó Snodaigh in respect of traditional Irish music, we have a shared vision regarding the outreach of all music and I have it in buckets when it comes to traditional Irish music. I was delighted recently to allocate an additional €150,000 to the Fleadh Cheoil in Mullingar as a signal of the value I place on traditional Irish music. On the point made by Deputies Ó Murchú and Boyd Barrett, SIPTU and Irish Equity have raised the issue of compliance with copyright legislation and, in particular, with the new EU directive on copyright as it applies in the audiovisual industry. It was raised at the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last night. In the first instance, my colleague the Tánaiste is responsible for the implementation and compliance, and breaches of copyright are a matter for his Department. Copyright is a complex area, but I understand SIPTU and Irish Equity made some suggestions to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight regarding dealing with the protection of intellectual property within the film tax relief. I have asked my officials to follow up and meet with SIPTU and Irish Equity to discuss and examine those very issues. To respond to Deputy Gannon and others on diversifying the concert hall, I might point to last weekend and the spectacular event with the haunted dancefloor experience in the concert hall. There were two very late nights as part of the night-time economy pilot. They went on until about 2.45 a.m. or 3 a.m., attracting very different crowds who had never before walked through those doors. That is what it is all about, namely, seeing the value of what we have at the heart of our capital city and reaching out to audiences of all sorts with all types of music. I visited the concert hall yesterday, and the board members were very excited about that weekend and loved that experience in the presence of the new audiences. I hope to see more of that with the expansion of the night-time economy. Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the budget. Arts Council funding has been doubled since 2017, which I did in the first budget I had, and we have that €6 million for the night-time economy. There is the game changer of the basic income scheme and we are leading the way as a country in how we value our artists, with every arts genre and every county included. Moreover, next year's culture allocation is 82% higher than that of 2020. We are continuing to engage with stakeholders about the needs of the commercial industry, but the Covid schemes that were in place were a response to public health restrictions, when doors were closed and performers were not performing. This time last year, people could not go to nightclubs and there were restricted audiences. We were debating whether people could stand or sit and that led to restrictions for performers. By contrast, people can go out tonight, perform and enjoy performances. The supports were specific to Covid. Nevertheless, I have that money for the night-time economy and the basic income scheme. We are continuing the engagement and those commercial venues will benefit from the horizontal supports. We are in different times compared with last year. They were Covid-specific supports when there was a shutdown in the sector. From the very beginning, we were trying to support online performances and so on, whereas now it is about the basic income scheme and developing the night-time economy. As I said, I have held on to the €130 million for the Arts Council, but we are continuing the engagement and we will meet some of the groups the Deputy mentioned. To return to the Bill, as I outlined, it is a technical Bill that will provide for the transfer of functions from RTÉ to the NCH. I again thank Deputies for their engagement. My officials have taken note of the many issues they raised and I am sure these will form part of our considerations. I request that Deputies who intend to table amendments to the Bill give us sight of them because I would like to undertake as much constructive engagement as possible in advance in order that we can give them due consideration. The Bill represents an important step forward in the journey of both the orchestra and the NCH. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st-century concert hall. The legislation will enable the NCH to commence the process of returning the orchestra to full strength and empower it to deliver on the recommendations outlined in the Boaden report. I acknowledge the hard work of my officials in preparing the Bill, which I am pleased to introduce to the Dáil. I look forward to it making steady progress through the Oireachtas and commend it to the House.

CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Friday, for the tight-knit community of Creeslough, was the beginning of the weekend. School was over. People were finishing up work. Children were buying treats and families in this peaceful rural community were running errands and stopping at the local Applegreen petrol station. Some had stopped to go into the station shop, were queuing for the post office or simply wanted to buy an ice cream. In the blink of an eye their lives ended after a deadly explosion tore the station and apartment complex apart. Everyday scenes in Creeslough's small rural community on that Friday autumnal afternoon changed in a second, tragically and cruelly for so many. It was an unmerciful sight, locals and response services said. Emergency services and locals worked through the night to rescue survivors and recover the deceased. Tháinig an pobal le chéile chun cabhair agus tacaíocht a thabhairt dá chéile. The incredible community spirit and support on show in the most awful of circumstances must be commended. Yet it is difficult to imagine how the scale of these sudden devastating losses and trauma can possibly be absorbed or comprehended by the community in Creeslough. Such suffering has no debt left in numbness but still the community rally as the first of the ten funerals have been held today. Four men, three women, two teenagers and a five-year-old girl all lost their lives - little Shauna and her father Robert, Hugh, Catherine and her son James, Leona, Jessica, Martin, James and Martina. The mourning is only beginning. We must honour those precious lives and support that broken community. Those children and adults will be remembered through mourning and we mourn together as a nation. Is minic in Éirinn agus fud fad Dhún na nGall go n-éistimid, le meas, le ceol an chaointe. Nach mór an cháil ar Chaoineadh na dTrí Mhuire?

CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move:That it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media on the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022, that pursuant to Standing Order 187, the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill in order to increase the aggregate amount of liability from £150,000,000 to €1,600,000,000 in respect of undertakings of cultural objects on loan from outside the State; and to change the consequential amendment of the long title to reflect the content of the Bill, and make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a second time." The National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industry. Section 24(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003 gives me, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) sets out the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming that the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of 2022. No further voted capital funding can then be advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I put the Bill before the Dáil to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. Before speaking on the further details of the Bill, I would like to outline the significant contribution and importance of the tourism sector to Ireland's overall economic performance and the progress made in recent times. As the House will be aware, this country has been extremely successful in turning the warmth of the Irish welcome and the beauty of the Irish countryside into a success story that we can all celebrate and be proud of. Tourism is Ireland's most important indigenous labour-intensive sector, generating substantial export earnings and tax revenues. It is woven into the fabric of Irish cultural and social life and is of critical importance to regional economies, in particular.  The contribution of tourism is not confined to directly generated employment, economic activity and exports. The sector has an important multiplier effect on other employment sectors, such as agriculture, transport, retail, food and beverage, which are particularly important to regional economies. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad, generating a positive impression of Irish people and our landscape and culture for our visitors. The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the tourism industry. As we rebuild this vital sector, we must build it back in a way that ensures the contribution of the tourism sector to our economic recovery and provides sustainable employment across Ireland in a way that protects our unique environment. Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges remain, from geopolitical to economic. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for the remainder of 2022 and 2023. Budget 2023 has secured continued additional funding of €15 million for overseas marketing of Ireland as a leading holiday destination and the development of the invitation project. Domestically, continued additional funding of €15 million will deliver a range of measures to support the sector. The Government also announced a temporary business energy support scheme which will support businesses, including those in the tourism sector. In budget 2022, the tourism budget included a large capital allocation of €35 million to Fáilte Ireland for tourism product development. This level of capital investment will continue in 2023 as budget 2023 has also provided for funding of €36.5 billion. Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise our ambition to be among the world leaders in sustainable tourism. My Department has initiated the development of a new national tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery in the sector. This new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable development in communities throughout the country, while protecting our environment and natural resources and with a greater spread of demand across the year. As a significant proportion of tourists are drawn to attractions and participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland offers a range of support to help tourism providers across the country to maximise their individual and collective offering in a way that attracts and engages tourists and enhances their overall experience. Accordingly, Fáilte Ireland's capital investment in tourism product development is further enhanced by complimentary programme supports, including for festivals and events, business supports and training, and marketing and promotions aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the overall tourism offering. Ultimately, in addition to enhancing the overall visitor experience for the benefit of visitors, the intention is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable development through increasing the geographic spread of visitors, promoting season extension and supporting sustainable growth management. A highlight this year has been the redevelopment of Avondale House and Forest Park. This €16 million project, in partnership with Fáilte Ireland, Coillte and EAK, has transformed Avondale into a unique family attraction and a key new destination in Ireland's Ancient East. It opened this summer and will be a vibrant destination for domestic and international tourists. Avondale Forest Park is also open to visitors to explore and enjoy the established walking and cycling trails, orienteering courses and recreation area. Beyond the Trees Avondale won the tourism and hospitality project of the year award at the Irish Building and Design Awards last week.  In addition to funding provided under the Platforms for Growth approach to large grants schemes, Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences in Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments. The strategic partnerships include entities such as Waterways Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Rural and Community Development.The regional strategies are currently undergoing a public consultation and they will set out a ten-year vision and five-year action plan for each region. At a more local level, these four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans, DEDPs, developed by Fáilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders including local authorities, local development companies, relevant State agencies and local community groups and tourism industry representatives. Fáilte Ireland plans to have a total of 27 DEDPs live by the end of this year. By 2025, every part of the country will have a destination development plan that is appropriate to its level of tourism maturity. There are four regional tourism experience brands in total covering the entire country and these are as follows: the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Dublin and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands. One of the guiding principles of my Department is to deliver high-quality tourism experiences that exceed our visitors' expectations but in a manner that minimises any negative environmental or community impacts. As custodians of our natural landscape, waterways and oceans and of our historic and cultural assets, we will protect them for the next generation. I look forward to these future generations enjoying all that Ireland has to offer. The Government is committed to continuing to support and strengthen the tourism sector which plays such a vital role in our locality and wider society. I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill in detail. The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord Fáilte Éireann and the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training, CERT, and establish the national tourism development authority, Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(1) of that Act gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine. Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises. However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process. This limit on total capital funding was originally set at €65 million but was later increased to €150 million and then €300 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Acts 2011 and 2016. Taking into account the 2022 capital allocation to Fáilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital projects is now approaching that limit. Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to Fáilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects. Accordingly, it is now prudent to legislate for an increase in the limit. I am introducing this Bill to make the necessary legislative change. I commend the Bill to the House.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Name the towns.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabhail leis na Teachtaí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht seo agus a chuir a dtuairimí faoi fhorbairt fhoriomlán thurasóireacht na hÉireann in iúl. I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate and offered their views on the overall development of Irish tourism. It is proof of the importance of the industry, which reaches into all parts of the country, both rural and urban. Many of them have been named in the last 30 minutes in particular. Tourism is a valuable source of employment for many thousands of people. I have no issue with towns, communities and regions. If there was ever an appropriate moment to name our areas, it is during a debate on tourism, so it is to be welcomed. There is no time for me to name all the places in Dublin Rathdown and County Monaghan so I will not elaborate.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the last two years have been most challenging for the tourism sector and we are facing into another demanding year with cost inflation and rising energy prices. Many issues have been raised during this debate. I do not know if ten minutes will suffice to address them but I will attempt to do so. If I do not respond to any Deputy, I will ask my officials to follow up.  Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and Nolan raised regional development, which is at the heart of Fáilte Ireland's remit. The organisation has created four regional brands, namely, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Dublin, Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. To guide medium to longer range development, I understand Fáilte Ireland aims to deliver four new regional tourism strategies in 2022. These will set out a ten-year vision and five-year action plan for each region. At a more local level, these four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans developed by Fáilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. Fáilte Ireland's focus on promoting the regions has included significant investment into brand-building through individual Keep Discovering campaigns for each of the four regional experience brands as well as media, publicity, digital channels and online sales platforms, and that will continue. Looking forward to 2023, Fáilte Ireland will continue to focus on building the regional brand. It will encourage domestic visitors to visit destinations across the country and through online booking and sales and marketing supports, it will work with the local industry. Deputy Gannon spoke about the development of Dublin as a brand. The Dublin Regional Tourism Development Strategy 2023-27 is the roadmap for the tourism industry and all stakeholders involved in tourism in the region to navigate the current challenges and steer a course towards sustainable recovery and continued success. Over the course of this strategy, in addition to the activation of the Dublin coastal trail and the ongoing implementation of the docklands destination experience development plan, two other DEDPs will be developed, namely, the Dublin City DEDP starting in 2022 and the mountains DEDP commencing in 2023. The night-time economy was also raised by Deputy Gannon and also Deputy Shanahan. It will continue to be supported and developed. That change is coming. Deputy Gannon asked when we will dance again and my answer is we will be dancing more often and much later into the night. That is the plan but the sector needs to be supported and that is why we got €6 million in the budget for the night-time economy and also €7 million in additional capital funding for artists' spaces and climate adaptation. Deputy Gannon also spoke about joined-up thinking. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I hosted a meeting before the summer recess attended by officials from my Department, the Departments of Transport and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as representatives from the Garda, vintners' organisations, Give Us the Night and residents' associations. There is, therefore, joined-up thinking on the development of the night-time economy. Deputy Gould referred to the flooding in Cork. I will raise that issue with my Government colleagues and refer his suggestions on Shandon and Cork city to Fáilte Ireland for further consideration. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputies Griffin and Dillon on the value of our greenways. Other Deputies referred to them as well. Deputies Carey and McNamara spoke about Shannon Heritage. I am aware of the proposed transfer of properties, including Bunratty Castle, from Shannon Heritage to Clare County Council. My officials are participating in an independent group, chaired by the Department of Transport, which is examining the issue. While I am of course supportive of any initiative to enhance tourism options in the area, this is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Transport. I will be happy, as requested, to speak to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Deputy Carey raised the Gathering, which made me think of the other programme for Government commitment. While the tourism sector continues to emerge from the impact of Covid, we will help with further recovery and rebuilding. The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a new tourism initiative to aid recovery in the sector. This initiative will seek to promote and build on the warmth of our welcome, the beauty of our landscape and the richness of our culture. I secured a €5 million allocation in the most recent budget to continue the development of the invitation initiative which provides an excellent opportunity to advance the recovery in multiple sectors that have been significantly impacted by Covid. I hope to bring proposals to the Government in the near future outlining my full ambition for the project and providing further detail on the work under way. Deputies Nolan and Kelly raised Ireland's Hidden Heartlands. Since its launch in 2018, Fáilte Ireland has been working with the local authorities, other State agencies such as Tourism Ireland and the tourism industry to raise awareness of the new Hidden Heartlands brand and to grow the visitor economy. Tourism Ireland promotes the Hidden Heartlands directly to overseas visitors and the region now features prominently on the Ireland.com website. The local authorities are key partners and Fáilte Ireland has been building partnerships with Waterways Ireland, Coillte, Bord na Móna and the Office of Public Works to optimise the tourism potential of their natural and heritage assets in a sustainable manner. Recent highlights included the launch of the tourism master plan for the Shannon, which saw €2.3 million invested by Fáilte Ireland in two new projects last year alone.Some €3.9 million was invested in the revamped National Famine Museum in Strokestown Park, which I had the honour to open last week. Deputy Shanahan raised issues regarding docking. I think that is a matter for the Minister for Transport and his officials. In response to Deputy Dillon, I know Fáilte Ireland is very active in Mayo. The Deputy referred to a number of projects. Fáilte Ireland will continue to focus on their continued development. Deputy Paul Donnelly raised a specific issue which I will ask my officials to raise with Fáilte Ireland. That might be under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Deputy Tóibín raised Moore Street, which is also a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, since these are heritage functions. I will raise the issues Deputy Tóibín brought up during this debate with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. In response to Deputy Shanahan, two sites, Ardmore and Tramore, have been selected under Platforms for Growth 2. I will ask my officials to raise any issues regarding accessibility and inclusivity with Fáilte Ireland. I will ask my officials to discuss with Fáilte Ireland the issues that Deputy Mattie McGrath raised during the debate. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae did fine promotion of the Killorglin area, Killarney and the entire region of Kerry. He was followed by Deputies Michael Collins, Christopher O'Sullivan, Danny Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Carol Nolan. A plethora of fantastic promotion of Ireland was captured in the debate. Well done to the Deputies. The sentiment, as mentioned by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, is that once visitors see what we have to offer, eat our food, meet the people, hear the music and see us dance, they will come back. That is why marketing is important. I am pleased to inform Deputy Munster that support of almost €500,000 was awarded to Louth County Council for the Drogheda destination town plan to implement an access and orientation plan. Regarding the Drogheda attraction of scale, the Ancient Destination Experience Development Plan identifies Drogheda as a key urban gateway to the ancient story of the Boyne Valley with the potential to be a tourism destination of scale. The project addresses the need for a sustainable world class visitor attraction to act as a catalyst to increase visitor footfall. Deputy Tóibín, as well as maybe Deputies Ó Murchú and Munster, talked about the Boyne Valley too and the reimagined Boyne Valley drive. That is a catalyst project in the implementation of the Ancient Destination Experience Development Plan. It involves reviewing and reimagining the Boyne Valley drive. That project roadmap is completed and includes an action plan for delivery. Its key output is the reimagined Boyne Valley drive. I told the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I would not get through all of the issues raised. I have noted them and we will get back to all Deputies about the numerous issues. Numerous Deputies mentioned the VAT rate. I am conscious that the reduced VAT rate has been an important element of the business supports secured for the tourism and hospitality sector in the last two years. The Government will continue to monitor tourism recovery and keep all supports, including the VAT rate, under review in that context. I am acutely aware of the incredible pressure that these businesses face.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(a) and 181(1).
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move: "That the Bill do now pass."
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill represents a crucial step forward in the journey of both the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st century concert hall. The legislation will support the concert hall's effort to return the orchestra to full strength and further empower it to deliver on the recommendations outlined in the Boaden report. The amendment to increase the limit of the State indemnity is a necessary measure that will support our cultural institutions to continue to present international quality exhibitions to the Irish public.Gabhaim buíochas leis na Comhaltaí as a mbreithniú ar an mBille seo. Tá mé ag tnúth le dul chun cinn trí na Tithe. I again thank all Deputies for their engagement and consideration of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Vicky Phelan was and will remain known as a tireless fighter for women, a courageous mother, a fearless CervicalCheck campaigner and someone whose generosity of spirit captured the whole nation. The mother of two's refusal to sign a confidentiality clause and her court action over misread smear tests ultimately exposed what was a system failure of CervicalCheck. Vicky's battle took an enormous personal toll, but that was borne with steadfast and unwavering commitment to the truth. In finding that truth, Vicky has done a great service to all women in this country. I do not think it is yet possible to grasp fully the scale of her contribution to our society. I am deeply conscious Vicky's wish of the political leaders was not for tributes, but for action, change and accountability. Women should never feel voiceless or invisible. The burden should not have fallen on Vicky to stand up for women and for what is right. We must change. With poise and through her determination and grit, Vicky taught us that. I cannot adequately express my admiration for Vicky's courage, resilience and generosity of spirit. I have heard her friends say she met every challenge with grace and good humour. We are all grieving an enormous loss today. To Vicky's husband, Jim, and to her beloved children, Amelia and Darragh, I say I cannot begin to imagine the pain and heartbreak they are feeling. I want to say "Thank you" to Vicky and "Thank you" to every person who supported her in her courageous battle to seek the truth for women in Ireland. I will remember and I hope others will remember Vicky's own words from her autobiography:There will be others who will continue this fight without me when I'm gone, because we are all in this together at the end of the day. We all come from that same place, from a mother's womb. This is everybody's story. A Vicky, tá muidne, mná na hÉireann, thar a bheith buíoch díot. Labhair tú amach ar ár son uilig, ar son na máithreacha, na hiníonacha, na seanmháithreacha, na gariníonacha, na deirfiúracha, na deirfiúracha chéile, na neachtanna agus na cairde. Fágann tú léas solais i do dhiaidh. Mhúscail do mhisneach misneach ionann. Go ndéana Dia a mhaith ort.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Ireland is resolute in its solidarity and support for Ukraine and we are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. More than 63,000 people who have been forced to leave their homes in Ukraine have sought refuge in Ireland, and approximately 45,000 of these people are being provided with accommodation from the State. However, this war is causing ongoing challenges such as rising energy prices, scarcity of energy supply and supply chain issues including accommodation. This is by some distance the largest humanitarian operation undertaken by the Irish State, and tourism accommodation has played a vital part in this national response. However, I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry about how the amount of tourism bed stock taken out of the system for humanitarian reasons is likely to have a real impact on tourism's recovery in 2023 and beyond. In addition, hotel accommodation is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families, and this is why the Government is exploring a wide range of alternative options, including the rolling out of a rapid-build housing programme to provide accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. My officials have communicated these concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is working urgently across government and with agencies, NGOs and local authorities to bring new accommodation on board so that the State's humanitarian responsibilities can be met. In addition, my Department is participating in the senior officials' group that is focusing on meeting the current humanitarian accommodation and other needs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster. As I said, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. More than 45,000 Ukrainian people have sought accommodation from the State in addition to more than 16,000 international protection applicants. This compares with 7,500 at the same time last year. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department has sourced accommodation for the equivalent of the population of Waterford city in the past six months. My officials have communicated concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, especially in respect of the peak period, which starts from around St. Patrick's Day onwards. I have communicated these concerns also to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. That is why I am glad my Department is represented on that senior officials' group that is focusing on meeting the current humanitarian accommodation and other needs and conveying the concerns of the tourism sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Hotel accommodation has been seen from the very beginning as a short term solution. It is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families. That is why the Government is exploring the wide range of alternative options, including the rolling out of a rapid-build housing programme. The use of tourist accommodation to meet humanitarian needs, while necessary in the short term, has obviously led to concerns for everyone involved in tourism, from what I have heard from engagement with the sector. My Department is represented on the senior officials' group on this issue. In addition, my Department has regular engagement with the sector representatives on a range of issues, including this. Department officials will next meet with the tourism agencies and tourism sector representatives on 6 December 2022. There is ongoing engagement with the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and between me and the Minister, and I have conveyed the concerns of the industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá sé ríthábhachtach domsa go dtugtar stádas comhionann don Ghaeilge i ngach réimse den saol, ach go háirithe i leith na craoltóireachta, a bhfuil ról ríthábhachtach aici i múnlú fhéiniúlacht agus chultúr na hÉireann. As the Deputy will recall, this issue of potential pay discrepancies between workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta and their English language counterparts, and the ongoing review by RTÉ of its grading structure, was raised during Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill on 26 October last. I know it is something of which Deputy Munster has been cognisant and has brought to the fore. At that time, if she remembers, I undertook to seek clarification from RTÉ on the issue and to respond to the committee. On foot of this, my officials wrote to RTÉ seeking such clarification, and in response RTÉ has provided further detail on the ongoing review process. I am informed that the review process involves a detailed and full evaluation of all staff roles and grades, including an assessment of the organisation's skills and requirements as a modern media organisation. I am aware that when the matter was raised with RTÉ by the Committee of Public Accounts earlier this year, at the meeting to which Deputy Munster referred, the director general confirmed that a comparison between Irish language workers and their English language counterparts was not specifically included in the terms of reference for the current process. However, it is designed to enable RTÉ to devise a simplified grading structure with fairness and transparency across all roles, including those in Raidió na Gaeltachta. The process is ongoing and is likely to be concluded in June of next year. The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009, RTÉ is independent in the pursuit of its objects, both in terms of editorial decisions and its day-to-day management and operational activities. However, parity of esteem for the Irish language is very important and, therefore, I share the Deputy's concerns to ensure there is no disparity in pay that is purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work. As such, I have written to RTÉ this week asking that it communicates directly with the joint committee to set out how this process could address the committee's concerns about the terms of employment of Irish language workers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I share the Deputy’s concern to make sure there is no disparity in pay. That is why, after Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I committed to the Oireachtas joint committee that we would have follow-up discussions with RTÉ, which my officials did. I have written to RTÉ, with regard to disparity in pay which is purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work, outlining that there must be equality. While those in RTÉ, through the engagement with officials, have provided further detail on the ongoing process, I have asked them to communicate directly with the committee to set out how the process will address the pay disparity. I think we are on the same page in keeping a focus on this.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Parity of esteem for the Irish language is very important. I have asked RTÉ in my communication with it this week that it communicates directly with the joint committee to set out this process, which I think will address what the Deputy is looking for, and set out how that process could address the committee's concerns about the terms of employment of Irish language workers. I do not wish to pre-empt what further clarity RTÉ might provide but I am more than happy to continue the engagement with RTÉ on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	.As I set out in my response to Deputy Munster on the issue of potential pay discrepancies between workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta and their English language counterparts, RTÉ is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of its staff grading structure. I am advised that this process involves a root-and-branch evaluation of all staff roles and grades, including an assessment of the skills needs and requirements of the organisation. It is designed to enable RTÉ to devise a streamlined grading structure with fairness and transparency across all roles, including those in Raidió na Gaeltachta. The review is ongoing and I understand it is likely to conclude in June next year. Deputy Munster asked for clarification in that regard. Tá sé ríthábhachtach domsa go dtugtar stádas comhionann don Ghaeilge i ngach réimse den saol, ach go háirithe i leith na craoltóireachta. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá ról ríthábhachtach aici i múnlú féiniúlacht agus chultúr na hÉireann. It is of critical importance to me that the Irish language is given equal status in all spheres of life, but particularly in respect of broadcasting, which serves such a crucial role in shaping Irish identity and culture. I would therefore share the Deputy's concerns with regard to ensuring there is no disparity in pay that is purely related to the language through which a person conducts his or her work. I am aware the Committee of Public Accounts has raised its concerns on this matter with RTÉ directly and that RTÉ has committed to providing an update to that committee in due course. As the Deputy will recall, the issue was also raised with me on Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. As I stated to the Deputy's colleague, issues relating to staffing and remuneration are operational matters for RTÉ and I am mindful of its statutory independence in these matters, as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. Nevertheless, my officials have engaged with RTÉ to seek further clarity on the matter and will continue to monitor the progress and outcome of the review process in the context of the Department's corporate governance oversight of RTÉ. Notwithstanding this, I consider it necessary and important for RTÉ to address comprehensively the concerns raised by the committee in respect of the pay of Irish language workers, and I have written to RTÉ asking that it respond to the joint committee in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I outlined in my replies to the Deputy and to Deputy Munster, both of whom I thank for raising this important issue, parity of esteem between the Irish and English languages is vital and so I share the Deputy's concerns in respect of any disparity in pay purely related to the language through which a person conducts his or her work. Although we have been told the ongoing review is not specifically designed to address any disparity in the remuneration of Irish language workers at RTÉ compared with their English language counterparts, the current review process is examining all roles in the organisation. While RTÉ has provided further detail on the ongoing process, I have written to ask it to address the specific concerns of the committee, to communicate with the joint committee, and to set out how the process will address pay disparity. I do not wish to pre-empt any further clarity RTÉ might provide but I am happy to engage further with it on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I have to emphasise that this is a matter for RTÉ, given its statutory independence. My Department has no role in the day-to-day administrative or operational functions of RTÉ and, therefore, I cannot direct it in matters relating to staff remuneration. It is vital, however, that there is parity of esteem between both languages. There should also be transparency and clarity on the grading of and, by extension, remuneration for workers, regardless of the language through which their work is conducted. That is why I asked RTÉ to provide greater clarity and address Members' concerns regarding the remuneration of Irish-language staff and how this process will achieve this. On the Deputy's specific question, it would be more prudent to await the outcome of the review before I jump to any conclusions. I will assess where we are when I see that review.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My role and that of my departmental officials in tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy development and in securing resources to assist the tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in implementing that policy. With regard to specific expenditure by Fáilte Ireland from its Exchequer funding allocations, such decisions are an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, as the national tourism development authority. Neither I, nor my Department, has any role in decisions by the authority regarding its operational funding priorities and related expenditure. On future funding, Fáilte Ireland is unable to commit to any funding at this time as there are currently no schemes open for application. Fáilte Ireland has, however, pledged its full support to the company that will be charged with steering the development of King John's Castle going forward. Indeed, a Fáilte Ireland representative will sit on the board of the newly-formed company. The Limerick City and County Council takeover of King John's Castle has been a big step forward for the success of the castle and the implications for the wider tourism economy will be far-reaching. As the council only took ownership in April, I am advised that the focus for the summer season was to steady the ship operationally first. King John's Castle had a very successful summer that was full of events, including high-profile concerts, encouraging visitor feedback, and high-profile media coverage nationally and internationally. Fáilte Ireland continues to support King John's Castle through a number of enterprise supports, including, but not limited to, saleable experience and digital that delivers. This is against the backdrop of continued investment in Limerick by Fáilte Ireland, including funding, which will develop a thematic city quarter cluster approach to introduce visitors to each distinctive area of the city and link existing visitor attractions to supporting experiences. From a wider perspective on tourism capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a tourism sector that is sustainable from environmental, social, and economic perspectives. Fáilte Ireland's priority areas for tourism capital investment include the development and enhancement of tourist attractions and activity-based tourism to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking. Our overall tourism product offering has led to Ireland being recognised internationally as a year-round, high-quality tourism destination in both urban and rural settings.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, Fáilte Ireland will have a representative sitting on the board of the newly-formed company. It has pledged full support to the company that will be charged with the development and steering of it. As the Deputy agreed, the company has had quite a successful summer in steadying the ship, with those wonderful events and concerts and high-profile media coverage, which is good, not just for King John's Castle but the wider area. I am quite happy to visit King John's Castle and undertake other engagements in Limerick; I can chat to the Deputy about that. I will link in with my officials to see where that can be arranged in the diary. I look forward to it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, the tourism offering in Limerick is vast and within the development of our new national tourism policy, where some consultation is now happening with stakeholders, there will be public consultation in the new year. We are looking to put sustainability at the heart of tourism. That includes all-year-round tourism and driving it out in order that visitors do not just arrive at the capital city for a few days but explore the regions. That is significant. Our greenways, as we have in Limerick, and blueways or waterways, are key to that. On Foynes, we have the Foynes Flying Boat & Maritime Museum, which has received €1.5 million from the rural regeneration development fund. We should also consider everything that has been done regarding outdoor dining facilities and funding for the Limerick greenway. As I said, there is significant potential there. On Adare, the Ryder Cup 2027 will be massive for Limerick. I look forward to that and to engaging on it. Fáilte Ireland sees the massive potential in that, as does Tourism Ireland. It is being talked about worldwide at every event members of those bodies attend.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together. The basic income for the arts, BIA, pilot was a key priority for me as Minister with responsibility for arts and culture. I see this scheme as an important intervention to support the arts sector recover after the devastation wreaked by the Covid pandemic. Covid clearly highlighted both the precarious nature of working in the arts but more so, it shone a light on the importance of the arts for us all. It is well established that artists suffer from precarious incomes. The scheme will research the impact of providing the security of a basic income on the creative practice of artists and creative arts workers. The pilot was also the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery taskforce, which I established in 2020 to examine ways in which to help the arts recover post-pandemic. I was very pleased to have been able to deliver on this recommendation with the first payments on the scheme being made to recipients two weeks ago. A total of 2,000 recipients are being paid €325 a week for three years while 1,000 control group members are being paid €650 per year to engage in the data collection. The scheme will cost €35 million per year and €105 million in total. A total of 1,992 recipients have received their payments to date. A small number of participants have decided not to accept their place on the scheme and these places will be reallocated shortly. It will be weighted in such a way that they will be treated in the same way as the 2,000 original applicants were selected. The research will examine over a three-year period the impact of a basic income-style payment on artists and creative arts workers. This research element is a hugely important part of the pilot scheme. The scheme recognises that there is a vast body of often unpaid or underpaid time that goes into the making of the creative work that we as a society enjoy. The ambition of the scheme is that by providing the security of a basic income, artists and creative arts workers can focus on artistic work and be in a position to increase their earnings from their creative practice as a self-employed artist or creative. I have established the scheme very firmly as a research project so that an evidence base can be developed around the impact of the policy. The scheme is a randomised control trial that consists of two groups of randomly selected people. The treatment group will receive the basic income while the control group will not receive it. Analysis of the results will involve a comparison of averages between the two groups. As the groups have the same characteristics at baseline and are large enough to be a statistically representative sample, any difference arising during the trial can be assumed to have been caused by the policy. I am very grateful to all the applicants who agreed to participate in the control group. Being able to compare and track their careers against those who will receive the BIA will be essential in demonstrating the impact of the payment on artists and their creative practices. Participants will be surveyed at least twice a year and will keep a journal so they are in a position to give accurate data. Focus groups, interviews and seminars will also happen to collect more qualitative data on how the scheme is impacting participants' lives. Baselining research information has been received from recipients who have accepted their place on the scheme so that research has already kicked off. Research findings on the impact of the pilot on the individuals and their practices, the sector and ecology of the arts in Ireland will form an important part of the pilot. Data on income and earnings, time use, work and job quality, well-being and mental health will be collected using a longitudinal survey every six months plus focus groups, interviews and art form specific research topics. The Government wants to give recognition to the value of the arts and the role of creative practice in Irish society. That is what this pilot scheme is all about. It is about addressing the earnings instability that can be associated with the intermittent, periodic and often project-based nature of work in the arts. I believe that the BIA pilot scheme is a once-in-a-generation, transformational measure in the funding of the arts in Ireland. It makes a strong statement at home and abroad about the value that Ireland as a nation places on artistic practice both for its intrinsic value and in terms of our personal and collective well-being and also in terms of its importance to our identity and cultural distinctiveness on the global stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A total of €25 million was allocated for this year because we knew we would not have a full year of basic income and that it would take time to get the randomised process up and running to do the engagement. I welcome and appreciate the Deputy's constructive engagement throughout this process. He has been very supportive of this scheme, which I think comes from his and his family's direct experience of the arts. All will get the full three years of payment. That is guaranteed regardless of when it started. It is a three-year project. It started on 29 August 2022 and will be a three-year project. My plan is for the savings in 2022 will be re-purposed and we will give further consideration to that but it is guaranteed to be €35 million per year and to be a full three-year project.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is my plan to re-purpose. The details will be available shortly. It will support artists, energy supports they need and the issues that affect the arts, like any other sector. In respect of 2025, the research piece is ongoing. We already have the baseline from the participants who received their payment. Something will be published every six months so we will see the benefits and impact of it as it is ongoing so it will not be the case that suddenly in August 2025 we will have the effect of this. We will have that continuous assessment from the control group and the 2,000 successful applicants.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 7, line 27, to delete “sound”.Amendments Nos. 1, 92, 94, 95, 97, 100, 101 and 103 collectively provide for the inclusion of providers of community television as bodies that may apply for funding under the scheme for professional journalistic practices. This matter was raised on Dáil Committee Stage and, having examined the issue, I will bring these providers into the scope of the scheme. As the Government amendments address the substance of the related amendments tabled by Deputies today, amendments Nos. 93, 96, 98 and 99, I will not be accepting those related amendments.  Amendment No. 102 seeks to require that, in developing a scheme, coimisiún na meán shall have regard to developing impartial journalism through the medium of Irish. In the context of this particular scheme, which is directed towards training in respect of good journalistic practices, I do not believe it necessary to make reference to the language in which that journalism is provided to the public. However, while I do not accept the amendment, I do agree with the objective of developing journalism through the medium of Irish. The purpose of amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, is to clarify that the definition of "programme schedule" in the Bill encompasses both audiovisual programmes and sound programmes and that references to "programmes" in the definition of “sound broadcasting service” are references to sound programmes. Amendment No. 7 corrects a typo in the definition of "video-sharing platform service". These amendments are being proposed as a result of engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9, 16, 18 to 27, inclusive, 30, 31 and 33 is to align the wording in the Bill regarding the roles of the Minister with responsibility for coimisiún na meán and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of certain financial and staffing matters with the wording in the public spending code. As such, they are technical amendments and do not have any substantive effect on the Bill. Amendments Nos. 51, 74, 79, 128 and 129 fix a number of typos and clarify punctuation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster for her engagement on Committee Stage with regard to that amendment. On Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point, I am advised that it is not necessary to make reference to any language medium in which journalism would be provided to the public. It is about the journalism.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Ó Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe. During the course of Committee Stage, I undertook to come back to Deputy Ó Snodaigh on the proposal to substitute "Coimisiún" and "Coimisinéir" for "Commission" and "Commissioner" wherever mentioned in the Bill. As the Deputy referred to, I wrote to him in this regard on 16 November. As he has said himself, I understand and agree with the underlying intention of the proposed amendment but, at this stage, it would require more than 500 individual amendments to be read, moved and voted on, which would be onerous and burdensome. However, I will seek Government approval to bring forward a single amending provision to affect the necessary changes for inclusion in future legislation as soon as is practicable.This would be an efficient and effective way to achieve the intended aim. As I set out in the letter, the current approach in the Bill fulfils the requirement of section 9D(1) of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, once sections 4 and 5 of that Act are commenced, because it provides that the legal name of the new regulator is to be coimisiún na meán. The reference to commission and commissioner is for interpretive purposes for the English language version of the Bill. Is í fírinne an scéil ná gur féidir an cuspóir atá taobh thiar de na leasuithe a moladh a bhaint amach trí leasú amháin ar an mBille nuair a achtófar é. Ag an bpointe seo, bheadh os cionn 500 leasú ag teastáil chun an leasú mar a bhí beartaithe. This is the reason, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said, that once this becomes an Act it can be done with one amendment in the future.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 12, line 19, after “audiovisual” to insert “or sound”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 13, line 10, after “providing” to insert “sound”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 13, line 15, after “to” to insert “sound”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 13, line 38, to delete “or”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	 I move amendment No. 8:In page 18, line 23, to delete “consent” and substitute “approval”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 9:In page 18, line 23, to delete “approval” and substitute “consent”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I set out on Committee Stage with regard to amendment No. 10, I am advised that it is not appropriate to give a public body this type of general power. It should be explicitly linked to its functions. This is why the Bill provides for these powers in relation to designated online services and their compliance with online safety codes. Under the Bill it will be an offence for them not to do so. On amendment No. 35, the Digital Services Act sets out a detailed process by which this may be done. The Digital Services Act came into force on 16 November. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, leads on the implementation of the Digital Services Act in our national law. Dealing with this in the Bill would duplicate and pre-empt that work. Therefore, I do not accept these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as ucht a gcuid leasuithe. As I set out on Committee Stage, I believe the intention of amendments Nos. 11 and 12 is already provided for in paragraphs (c) and (e) of section 7(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Bill. Mar sin, ní mholaim glacadh leis na leasuithe seo. I will not accept amendment No. 13 because an coimisiún will undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system on foot of a recommendation of the Future of Media Commission.  I thank the Deputies for proposing amendments Nos. 28 and 29. Section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may establish committees to assist and to advise it on matters relating to its functions or on such other matters as it may determine. The effect of the amendment would be to mandate an coimisiún to establish a committee that would monitor and report on compliance with obligations and propose recommendations on the use of the Irish language across the media. While I appreciate the intentions behind this amendment, I cannot accept it. I have some worries about mandating the establishment of multiple committees in legislation as, notwithstanding the language used, that tends to fix the subject matter of the committee to a moment in time. Accordingly, I am advised that it is more appropriate to allow an coimisiún the flexibility to define the terms of reference of any committee established pursuant to section 19. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 34 because, as I said on Committee Stage, it may imply there is a hierarchy of objectives of an coimisiún. It is intended that an coimisiún fulfil all its statutory functions, from online safety to the promotion of programming in the Irish language, and set them out in its statement of strategy accordingly. Amendment No. 53 would infringe on the editorial freedom of both advertisers and media service providers and, in any case, we are addressing this through section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, which will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media. Amendment No. 36 seeks to make statutory provision for a consultation on the provision of a dedicated Irish language youth radio service. As I have previously noted during this Bill's passage through the House, I will not accept this amendment because the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisiún na meán undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. The results of the review will inform the development of any actions necessary in this area. Amendments Nos. 43, 48 and 50 are similar in intent to amendments proposed in the Seanad on gender and nationality quotas in respect of musical works. I carefully considered those proposals and, on foot of legal advice from the Attorney General, decided not to introduce any provision for them on Committee Stage but, instead, sought and obtained Government approval to draft amendments to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. The issue of quotas raises complex legal questions. There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports. For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from €37.2 million in 2020 to €52.2 million in 2023. That is the basis for my rationale for not accepting these amendments. I thank the Deputies for amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive. These amendments would have the effect of requiring media service rules relating to accessibility to reflect the needs of Irish speakers. While I fully welcome the intent behind the amendments, I am of the view that it would be appropriate to defer the introduction of such a measure until coimisiún na meán, on foot of a recommendation of the Future of Media Commission, undertakes a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. This would allow coimisiún na meán to assess fully the capacity of the broadcasting sector in respect of the accessibility of Irish language content. This review could then inform future updates to the rules coimisiún na meán makes in respect of accessibility. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, ba é ceann de na moltaí a rinne an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán ná go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar sheirbhísí agus ábhar Gaeilge ar fud chóras na meán. Ghlac an Rialtas leis an moladh sin. Déanfaidh coimisiún na meán an t-athbhreithniú seo, agus táthar ag súíl go dtógfaidh sé 18 mí chun é a chríochnú. Leag Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán roinnt ceisteanna amach ina thuarascáil ar ceart don athbhreithniú díriú orthu, lena n-áirítear ról RTÉ, TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus soláithrithe ábhair. Ina theannta sin, moladh go scrúdódh an t-athbhreithniú deiseanna do chomhoibriú agus do chomhpháirtíocht amach anseo, straitéisí le haghaidh rannpháirtíochta óige, cláir óige agus oideachas. Cé nár mhian liom talamh slán a dhéanamh de mhionsonraí athbhreithniú neamhspleách an choimisiúin, bheinn ag súil go mbeadh an próiseas leathan go leor chun na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an Teachta a chlúdú. Táim ag súil freisin go ndéanfaidh an coimisiún, go háirithe an coimisinéir um fhormhaoirsiú na meán, agus an coiste Oireachtais plé ar an ábhar seo. I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Munster and Mythen for amendment No. 81. As I set out on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the amendment because it would be inappropriate to pick out only two EU languages in the context of this Bill transposing the audiovisual and media services directive. As important, though, the amendment would appear not to reflect the fact that Irish and English are separate languages and that a word or phrase which may be functionally equivalent in one language may carry entirely different implicit meanings or connotations in the other, which may cause either or both to fall within a particular category of harmful online content. I therefore cannot accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sílim go raibh mé soiléir go leor. Caithfimid fanacht go dtí go bhfaighfear na moltaí a rinne an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán agus go ndéanfar athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar sheirbhísí agus ar ábhair Gaeilge ar fud chóras na meán mar atá. We should wait for that. The commission set out in this report a number of issues that the review should focus on which I named earlier and which we should wait for. Tá sé sin leathan go leor chun na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an Teachta a chlúdach.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment seeks to require coimisiún na meán to meet with the gambling regulatory authority biannually and to produce reports on online gambling annually. As I set out on Dáil Committee Stage, the Bill already addresses the issue, which is essentially about the co-operation of regulatory bodies on the issue of gambling, by setting out that coimisiún na meán must co-operate in relation to the regulation of gambling with any public body concerned with that matter and this will enable an coimisiún and the gambling regulatory authority when established with the flexibility to determine as independent regulators their necessary level of co-operation and engagement. This means that on establishment, an coimisiún will co-operate with the existing public bodies responsible for gambling and will also co-operate with the gambling regulatory authority when it is established.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as a gcuid leasuithe. Ní ghlacaim le leasuithe Uimh. 15, 17 nó 69, toisc, mar a luaigh mé ar Céim an Choiste, go ndéanann siad macasamhail d’fhorálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, 2003, mar a leasaíodh é, nó, i gcás leasú Uimh. 17, go bhfuil sé sriantach gan ghá. Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 69 all seek to require a minimum number of members of staff or commissioners in coimisiún na meán to be competent in the Irish language. It is important to set out the overarching legislative background that has been in place since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 last December.  Section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, now provides that the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee established under the Act shall have regard to the objective of increasing, by 31 December 2030 at the latest, the number of staff of public bodies who are competent in the Irish language such that at least 20% of staff recruited are competent. As I have previously indicated, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is specified as a public body in the First Schedule to the Act and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions of the Bill, coimisiún na meán will be considered a public body under the Act. On that basis I cannot accept amendment No. 15, which seeks to replicate the provisions of section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act within this Bill.  Similarly, I cannot accept amendment No. 17, which would require that no fewer than 30% of commissioners and 20% of staff of coimisiún na meán would be proficient in Irish. The Official Languages Act provides the basis for an objective which applies across public bodies. I do not see the merit in seeking to apply a specific requirement to coimisiún na meán.  As the Irish language services advisory committee continues its work over the coming years, consideration could be given to requiring competency in the Irish language for one of the commissioner posts. However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisiún na meán. Accordingly, the best way for providing for that recruitment is through the recruitment process for commissioners, rather than in legislation. Amendment No. 69 would require that no fewer than 50% of the board members of RTÉ be proficient in the Irish language. As I noted on Dáil Committee Stage, a provision of this kind would be at odds with provisions for membership of State boards more generally.  With regard to the criteria necessary for consideration as a member of the board of RTÉ, section 82 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 already provides that candidates must have “experience of or shown capacity in”, among others, “matters pertaining to the development of the Irish language”.  I do not believe that specific provision as contemplated by the amendment, over and above that already provided for, or in addition to the provisions for membership of State boards more generally is necessary.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh noted, the new chair of RTÉ who was appointed yesterday, Siún Ní Raghallaigh, is a former chair of TG4 and a fluent Irish speaker which I think will stand to her in her new role.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As a proud Monaghan woman, I fully agree with the Deputies on the public service value of the independent radio sector, particularly at local and regional level. I am sure Deputy Munster and I, living near each other as we do, listen to and value the same local and regional radio. Local radio stations are the very essence of public service broadcasting and, as Deputy Cannon and others said, they have proved a lifeline for many, particularly at the height of the Covid crisis, by providing critical local information and a vital sense of community when it was most needed. Regarding the calls for the broadcasting levy to be suspended or reduced, we must keep in mind the regulatory principle that a regulated service should only contribute to the cost of functions related to that service. That is the intention of subsection 21(5) of the Bill. It is an important principle based on legal advice. Therefore, it is not possible for the levy on designated online services to be used to fund a reduction in a levy on broadcasters. This is an argument that was also made to me in a submission. Exchequer funding for 2023 for an coimisiún is an interim measure to enable it to get started quickly on its new functions. One of its priorities will be the preparation and making of a levy order to ensure it becomes self-funding as soon as possible in respect of its full range of functions and to ensure online platforms pay a levy to fund the regulation of those entities and their activities. The amendment proposes that, "The Minister shall within 180 days of the passage of this Act lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on provision for a reduction in the levy in recognition of the public information service provided by independent radio stations." I am very conscious of the challenges facing the independent radio sector. While I do not believe this legislation is the appropriate vehicle to address immediate economic pressure facing the sector, I am cognisant of the concerns expressed by Members and the sector itself. Although I do not propose to accept the amendment, I acknowledge Deputy Cannon's request that I look at all options. To that end, I intend to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, this week to engage with the sector with a view to understanding the dynamics of the current economic environment and its impacts on the sector. I am conscious that the temporary business energy support scheme has only recently opened for applications and its benefits have not even been felt. I will ask the BAI to examine the extent to which these horizontal support measures will assist in alleviating current financial pressures. I am not ruling anything in or out at this juncture but it is important that we have robust and independent data to support any decision that might be taken. Rather than producing a report on a reduction in the levy within 180 days, as proposed in the amendment, I will ask the BAI to report back to me within 100 days, which would bring us into the first quarter of next year. Furthermore, when the executive chairperson of an coimisiún is formally appointed, I will meet that person and ask that he or she take into account Members' concerns when it comes to putting in place a new broadcasting levy order under an coimisiún na meán, which will take effect in 2024. I am looking at a report to me in the first quarter of 2023 and I am also looking to 2024 and a meeting with the executive chairperson. Of course, there also will be an in-depth engagement with the sector by an coimisiún na meán. Reducing the broadcasting levy is not the only way to support the sector. The Bill provides for a scheme to enable local broadcasters to avail of grant funding to provide training or professional development for persons employed by or providing services to the broadcaster in regard to promoting good professional journalistic practices. As Minister, I have supported the independent radio sector. In budget 2023, I secured €6 million for the establishment of the media fund, which will facilitate a local democracy reporting scheme and a court reporting scheme.They will be administered by coimisiún na meán and I would expect that local radio and newspapers would be well placed to benefit. My intention is that these would be in play and in a position to distribute before the end of 2023. The sound and vision scheme operated by the BAI provides significant support to the broadcasting sector and since taking office, I have allocated an additional €17.4 million in Exchequer funding to the scheme, within which €5 million has been ring-fenced for independent commercial radio and €1.2 million has been ring-fenced for community radio. The sectors also benefit under some of the other schemes. I understand that the sound and vision scheme does not include news and current affairs but it has promoted and supported the long-term sustainability of the sector and it has been strongly welcomed by the sector for doing so. The sound and vision scheme has supported the provision of important public service content for the Irish public, as well as making a real and significant contribution to meeting the costs of producing content for the radio sector. That is why I am announcing that I have decided to provide funding of €2.5 million before the end of this year for another specific round of the sound and vision scheme for commercial radio, which will be rolled out through the BAI in 2023. The value of this funding is greater than the full-year cost of the levy for the commercial radio sector. Those are my proposals in recognition of the concerns expressed by Deputies. I understand the concerns that Deputies Canney, Munster and Naughten have expressed and I am grateful to them for the amendments they put forward. I cannot accept the amendment but I have brought forward strong proposals to support the radio sector. Deputy Cannon asked me to explore all options and I hope he is in a position to accept that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are all in agreement on the real value of the independent radio sector. I appreciate the responses from Deputies. I will make that report available when it comes and as I said I am asking for it to be brought to me within 100 days. I will bring Deputy Cannon's concerns on the sound and vision application process to the BAI too. Although I am not accepting the amendment, I am committing to writing to the BAI this week so that I have robust and independent data in advance of any decisions that might be made on this. I will get that within 100 days, the Deputies will get to see the report and I will communicate the complexities of the process and the Deputies' concerns around that. As I have announced, I am also providing funding of €2.5 billion before year end for another specific round of the sound and vision scheme for commercial radio.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Similar to Deputy Cannon's point, it is about the process. The Deputy is saying it is about the length of time but it is about that scheme overall so I will bring those concerns to the BAI.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 33:In page 34, lines 12 and 13, to delete “publish, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,” and substitute the following:“, with the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, publish”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 38 would have the effect of preventing an coimisiún from co-operating with groups in the establishment of standards or self-regulatory systems as they relate to commercial communications. As I stated on Committee Stage of the Bill going through the Dáil, I cannot accept this amendment as it would appear to contradict the audiovisual media services directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive, and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms. Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. I cannot accept the amendment as it appears to contradict the audiovisual media services directive. The Bill will not be providing for, nor will an coimisiún be overseeing, the entire advertising regulatory framework in the State, which is distributed across a range of authorities. For example, Members will be aware that the forthcoming gambling regulation Bill will establish a gambling regulator to oversee the regulation of gambling, while the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 sets out provisions relating to the advertisement of alcohol. The commission will have a strong role in regulating commercial communications, including advertising, through media service codes, which will be binding on video-on-demand services and broadcasting services, and through online safety codes, which will be binding on designated online services. The main concern is that it would appear to contradict the audiovisual media services directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 39 would require an coimisiún to make a report setting out concrete steps for how media services providers established in Ireland, including RTÉ and TG4, can make their services widely available on an all-island basis. It should be noted that RTÉ and TG4 are currently obliged, insofar as possible, to provide their services to the whole of the island. As identified in the amendment, key to the goal would be all media service providers obtaining or retaining the rights to programmes in two jurisdictions, in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. Given the country-by-country nature of how rights related to media production are bought and sold, including the important part this plays in pre-financing productions in Ireland, this would lead to a significant increase in cost in providing, or loss of funding for, many different kinds of programmes. Accordingly, while I am sympathetic to the aim, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I noted when the issue was raised previously during this Bill's passage through the Houses, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it would be troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching their public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps. That goes to the core of the issue raised by Deputy Daly. However, I do not think we should prescribe in legislation in this level of detail what maps or geographical areas RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show on television. As I suggested on Committee Stage, this might be a matter that could more appropriately be raised with RTÉ by the joint committee. I acknowledge that this amendment seeks to address a number of previous instances which offended many people. However, I cannot accept the amendment as it would set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would have the effect of obliging Coimisiún na Meán to make a report and recommendations on how the State could make available broadcasts of sports events both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State. It would also have the effect of introducing conditionality on the availability of grants from Sport Ireland to sporting bodies linked to the availability of any broadcast, whether live or not, of their events on an all-island basis. The rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between the rights holders and broadcasters and, as such, it is not one Coimisiún na Meán can have a role in or one that can be legislated for. It is also not appropriate that conditions for grants that may be awarded by Sport Ireland would be linked to the negotiation of rights for any given event. Similarly, the running of competitions is an operational and commercial matter for the broadcasters and, again, it is not an area where Coimisiún na Meán can have a role or one that should be legislated for. As such, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would oblige Coimisiún na Meán to make reports and recommendations on how public bodies engaged in the distribution of State moneys for the production, screening and broadcast of audiovisual or sound content to ensure funds are distributed equitably and proportionally throughout the island of Ireland, with regard to the need for regional balance in investment and representation in audiovisual content, screen and sound. For a number of reasons, I will not accept the amendment. At its widest and taking account of the specific bodies referenced in the amendment, a definition of "public bodies" could cover the Revenue Commissioners in their role regarding the application of the section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland as regards making development and production loans available, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as regards the sound and vision scheme, TG4 as regards its role in commissioning content and RTÉ as regards its funding for independent productions through the independent production account established under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act. Each of the funds disbursed by those bodies may come from two sources, namely, from the Exchequer, in the form of funding for section 481, Screen Ireland loans and TG4, and from the licence fee, in the form of funding for RTÉ and the sound and vision scheme. While I appreciate the intent of the amendment to ensure more balanced regional development and representation, it touches on a number of fundamental issues that would render it unworkable due to the nature of the audiovisual sector in the State and potential issues regarding EU law. For example, TG4, as a publisher-broadcaster, commissions all its content production from Gaeltacht-based companies, largely in Galway but also in Cork and Waterford. Obliging TG4 to distribute funding equitably and proportionally throughout the island of Ireland could undermine its current commissioning model and the range of independent production companies that support this. It is natural that production companies providing for TG4 would be concentrated in Gaeltacht areas given a greater number of fluent Irish speakers live there. I would be worried about the unintended consequences of providing that funding by TG4 be spread regionally. The amendment would also impact on the operation of the section 481 film tax credit. The relief is distributed by the Revenue Commissioners and is technically open to any EU-based company that meets the qualifying criteria. Therefore, restricting the application of this relief to the island of Ireland, as suggested by the amendment, would appear to a contravention of EU law. I agree that seeking balanced regional development is important and it is an objective of Government, both within the national planning framework and underpinning the national development plan. However, I do not think it would be appropriate to place such an objective in legislation, as proposed by the Deputies. The amendment, as drafted, would appear to give rise to a number of unintended consequences.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to amendments Nos. 44, 52 and 57, as I outlined at Committee Stage, the main reason for the language in this section is that it is in line with the standard of “harm or undue offence” applied to material by the BAI through its code of programme standards, ensuring that the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition. In addition, freedom of expression is not absolute and like all other rights, it is subject to balancing in law to ensure that the rights of others, for example, the right to safety and security, are not unduly infringed. This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR. I am confident that the Bill sits comfortably within those traditions. For this reason, I am not accepting those amendments. With reference to amendments Nos. 45 and 46, the language used reflects existing provisions in section 39(1)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Section 7 requires an coimisiún to uphold the democratic values set out in the Constitution, including freedom of expression. Article 40.6 requires the State to limit freedom of expression in certain instances. The courts have since set a high bar for when it is appropriate for the State to do so and it is right that this language and associated jurisprudence should be carried forward through this Bill. I do not believe additional clarification needs to be added to the provision, as suggested in amendment No. 46. As such, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 45 and 46. I understand the Deputy’s position, however.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is what the BAI does currently on a case-by-case basis. That language has been carried over from the existing provision set out in section 39(1)(d) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009 which, in turn, reflects previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I set out at Committee Stage, the amendment would represent a significant policy initiative and, as such, requires extensive analysis and consideration with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed. For example, it does not appear to have any basis in European law. There are also issues to be addressed regarding the rate and nature of the levy, notwithstanding that the amendment now specifies “post tax revenue”. Finally, it appears to apply to services only established under the jurisdiction of the State which, in essence, could mean services looking to relocate away from Ireland arising from the imposition of such a levy. For these reasons, I will not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 51:In page 53, line 30, to delete “the” and substitute “a”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 54:In page 54, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:“(4) Media service codes may provide for standards and practices to promote the following:(a) balanced gender representation of participants in news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters or made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services;(b) the broadcast in programmes broadcast on sound broadcasting services of music composed or performed by women.”.This group of amendments are intended to allow Coimisiún na Meán make media service codes which promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes on radio, television and video-on-demand services and to promote the broadcasting of musical works composed or performed by women on radio services. A key goal of mine as Minister is to further gender equality within every sector under my remit, and to collaborate closely with my Government colleagues to drive change across other key Departments. Young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see or hear. There needs to be a significant improvement in the ratio of women to men on radio and television so that both genders feel represented in public discourse as well as better representation of women in music on our airwaves. Following careful consideration of the compatibility of gender balance measures with the right to freedom of expression and with competition law, it is considered that the most appropriate approach to further this goal is to empower Coimisiún na Meán to make codes setting out standards and practices in the promotion of greater representation for women in music and news broadcasting.  Such codes would be binding on providers of radio, television and video-on-demand services and, where breaches occur, could be subject to enforcement action by Coimisiún na Meán. This approach will allow Coimisiún na Meán the flexibility to identify appropriate measures to promote gender equality that are consistent with our legal framework.

This change was agreed in consultation with our public service broadcasters and is considered important to allow progression from outdated technologies with very little viewership.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for the amendment. The amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay of RTÉ employees. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh cothromaíocht ann idir an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla. Bheadh imní orm faoi aon difríocht pá a bhaineann go hiomlán leis an teanga ina ndéanann duine a chuid oibre. Parity of esteem between Irish and English is vital. I share concerns about any disparity in pay being purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work. RTÉ is undertaking a root-and-branch review of grading structures and examining all roles in the organisation, including Raidió na Gaeltachta. The Deputies are aware I have written to RTÉ asking it to address the concerns of the members of the committee and set out exactly how the process will address pay disparity. The independence of RTÉ, however, in operational matters is already provided for in legislation and I am advised it is not appropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I share the Deputies' concern in relation to parity of esteem between Irish and English and I have written to RTÉ asking it to address their concerns. If the Deputies do not receive a reply shortly, I will write to RTÉ again. I see an opportunity given that the chair of RTÉ who was appointed to the position yesterday is a fluent Irish speaker. I will meet the new chair, arising from her appointment, and will raise the matter with her.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The Bill provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industry. Section 24(1) gives me, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) sets out the amount that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming that the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of this year, so no further voted capital funding can be then advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I put the Bill before the Dáil to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. I thank the Deputies for their engagement. As I have outlined, this as a technical enabling Bill. It has an important outcome in that it allows for the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland’s work in the area of tourism product developments. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Comhaltaí as a mbreithniú ar an mBille seo.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The war in Ukraine, combined with the high number of international protection applicants, continues to put real pressure on the Government's ability to offer humanitarian accommodation and has resulted in the largest humanitarian effort in the State's history. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is availing of the wide range of offers of accommodation made to it, including the use of office buildings and sports facilities, to address the accommodation shortfall. These options are necessary to provide shelter to international protection arrivals, to meet basic needs and to prevent homelessness. The Government is focused on how to continue the sustained support for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, including those already here as well as those likely to be further displaced by the ongoing conflict. As part of this, the Government agreed that a move from an emergency response to a more mainstreamed approach, including a reduced reliance on serviced accommodation, is appropriate. This includes an increased focus on rapid-build housing and a new call for vacant homes led by local authorities. I can confirm that the Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid-build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. The rapid-build homes will be constructed on State-owned land. The Office of Public Works, OPW, is leading the development of this accommodation in conjunction with the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. The objective is to install 500 units by March-April 2023. My Department, at the senior officials group on Ukraine, has communicated the potential challenges arising for the tourism ecosystem, particularly in those parts of the country where high proportions of the tourism accommodation stock are directed to humanitarian purposes. The recent report from the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, which called for a reduced dependence on tourism accommodation and a geographically balanced spreading of such usage across the country, is relevant in this context. My officials are engaging with a range of Departments, with input from colleagues in Fáilte Ireland, on how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of long-term use of tourism accommodation. Analysis is being done on those towns or areas most impacted in this regard, with a focus on the sectoral skills at risk and the businesses suffering most from the lack of tourism accommodation. My Department will engage further on that analysis in the period ahead.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have regular interaction with my colleagues in the Government on this issue and have communicated the industry's concerns about the long-term effect this issue could potentially have on our tourism sector, especially, as the Deputy said, with the tourism season really kicking off in March.I meet the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, every week and have discussed the impact of the humanitarian response on tourism with him and other Cabinet colleagues. The Government has approved the construction of rapid-build homes, with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals and family units. These will be built on State-owned land. After a programme of engagement with public representatives and local authorities, work has begun on the first phase of sites in Cork, Cavan, Claremorris, Mallow and Thurles. Following further engagement and the completion of suitability assessment work, further sites will come on stream in the coming weeks. I met the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, in December following the publication of its report on the impact of the Ukrainian conflict. Officials in my Department and Fáilte Ireland meet representatives of the tourism sector monthly. These meetings are hosted by Fáilte Ireland. The hospitality and tourism forum that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, and I will co-chair will meet next week to hear and address concerns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, there will be 700 rapid-build homes. There will be up to 6,000 beds available in the coming months through the combination of rapid-build homes, the work on vacant homes that is being led by local authorities and the refurbishment work led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I am in regular engagement with the tourism sector and am fully cognisant of its concerns. I will meet it again through the tourism and hospitality forum with the Minister, Deputy Coveney. We are also concerned about the impact on ancillary businesses. We will consider supports for tourism and hospitality in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for raising the film industry in the week that is in it. This is an opportunity to congratulate Irish people on their Oscar nominations. The annual global spotlight on the Oscars is now shining on Ireland's culture, our beautiful scenery and, most particularly, our creative talent. The House will join me in congratulating the casts and crews of "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin", including Colm Bairéad and the team, Kerry Condon, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Martin McDonagh. I also congratulate other Irish nominees - Paul Mescal, Richard Baneham and Jonathan Redmond - on their nominations. It is a pleasure to be able to name so many Irish people who are making their mark on a global stage. Success breeds success and Ireland is a more attractive location for film-making as a result. I understand that the Deputy is referring to matters raised at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's examination of section 481. I am aware that the committee has taken evidence from many witnesses and organisations as well as from officials from my Department. As I understand it, many different views were expressed to the committee, with most witnesses underlining the importance of section 481 to the audiovisual industry and to Ireland. I respect and am passionate about the rights of workers, but as I have stated previously, this matter does not fall to my Department. Employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the mechanisms for dealing with disputes - the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. These are the appropriate avenues for complaints relating to employment law. I ask that, if the Deputy is aware of wrongdoing, he please bring that information to the WRC. I understand that the intellectual property issue raised by Equity focuses on the question of whether residuals are paid. This is a matter for consideration by the members of Equity in conjunction with SIPTU. If they so decide, they can enter into negotiation with the organisations and companies that engage them. I wish to bring to the attention of the House that our Oscar-nominated films were made during Covid. They should be applauded for this. Every one of the cast and crew of the films worked under difficult restrictive protocols at all times during production. I am so proud of our film industry today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am just stating a fact that employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the mechanisms for dealing with disputes. Regarding the protection of workers, significant changes were made in 2019 to section 481 and how it operated. There is an increased emphasis on upskilling and life-long learning as well as much greater scrutiny. I hope that these changes will ensure that any alleged malpractice prior to 2019 is not repeated in today's audiovisual industry. In addition to those changes, the "Safe to Create" programme that I launched in October provides for a dignity at work framework whereby all workers should have the right to expect a workplace that is free from bullying, harassment, humiliation, intimidation, victimisation and any other negative behaviour. Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, would strongly refute any claim of blacklisting in the Irish film industry. SPI can demonstrate its commitment to its relationship with the unions and is doing additional work in the areas of skills development and training. We are doing whatever we can to protect workers' rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I only have a minute to respond, but I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards if he wishes to bring further issues to my attention.In the application process for the certification under section 481, a producer company and a qualifying company, as defined by the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, are required to sign an undertaking in respect of quality employment and must, as a condition of certification, provide details of any Workplace Relations Commission decisions in relation to a qualifying company, the producer company or other companies in the film group, and, where those decisions are finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. In relation to the copyright, I repeat that the buyout of contracts relating to intellectual property rights as well as copyright issues in general falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am aware some witnesses in that committee expressed a view that there should be an agreement between employers and workers in Ireland on whether and when residual payment could or should be paid, but any general agreement on the payment arranged for actors and whether it includes residuals is first and foremost a matter for the trade unions and their members and thereafter dependent on its members' preference as a matter for engagement with employer representatives. I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The latest research by Fáilte Ireland shows that while recruitment is still a significant challenge for tourism businesses, the situation is improving and employers are making positive strides. The number of vacancies across the industry has fallen, from 40,000 at the start of 2022 to 22,000 today. Overall, positions have become less difficult to fill while staff retention has become less difficult too. For employees, hourly rates of pay have improved, compensation for working unsocial hours has become more common and job security among workers has grown. My Department participates in the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Departments and the education sector. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are also working with industry and across government to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.For example, in 2022, my Department and Fáilte Ireland worked closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure processing times for work permits were significantly reduced. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have also worked with that Department to increase work permit application success rates by providing information sessions to the industry. In 2023 and the years ahead, my Department and Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with industry and recruitment experts to share best practice guidance on retention and building capability. With regard to working conditions in the sector, Fáilte Ireland's research indicates that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. Around 70% of businesses surveyed indicated they are increasing their pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other benefits. Fáilte Ireland has also launched a new employer excellence programme to help participating businesses to improve their employer practices and enhance their reputation as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of their workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across their businesses. Further initiatives undertaken include a transition year work placement programme to give transition year students a high-quality work placement and a major recruitment awareness campaign called "works for me" to encourage people of all ages to consider a career in the industry. When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the industry, it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required, and that is the approach my Department and I will continue to pursue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I co-chair the hospitality and tourism forum. We are convening a meeting next week with all the stakeholders. I suspect the 9% VAT rate will be one of the issues that arises in that meeting. I have made it clear that I am in favour of the extension of the lower rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector. The decision ultimately lies with the Minister for Finance, but I have made clear my position on it. I am acutely conscious of the challenges the sector is facing, including cost inflation and economic uncertainty in key tourism markets. I am also aware our necessary humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine has impacted on the availability of tourism accommodation. I will continue to work with the Minister for Finance and Cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy referred to Duncannon Fort. In December 2022, the Department of Rural and Community Development announced significant funding for Duncannon Fort under the town and village renewal scheme. That is in recognition of the amazing attraction it is. I am acutely aware that the tourism industry supports 250,000 jobs and the vast majority of those are in the regions, outside the capital city. I grew up outside the capital. It is a vital industry in my remit and I am acutely aware of the need to help our towns and village to thrive. I am co-chairing the hospitality and tourism forum with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who, as someone from outside the capital, is aware of the immense value of tourism and the concerns of the wider tourism ecosystem. That is absolutely on our radar and we will do our best to support it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges remain, from geopolitical to economic. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry here in Ireland this year. Though the strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year is very welcome, significant headwinds face the sector in 2023. To assist businesses, including hotels, the Government introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, in budget 2023. The TBESS is designed to support businesses, including hotels, with their energy costs over the winter months and will run until 28 February 2023. The TBESS is administered by the Revenue Commissioners who have designed a special online platform for businesses to register for, and claim under, the scheme. From a tourism perspective, I am continuing to direct significant resources to supporting the sustainable recovery of the sector. I secured €15 million in additional funding for overseas marketing of Ireland. This budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million in continuation of the investment in skills development and retention. This provision will facilitate the continuation of work by Fáilte Ireland to address the employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. My Department and Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with the industry and across Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles. A €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing was also secured to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have secured additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. While the hotel sector faces many challenges, I am confident the supports the Government has put in place will ensure Ireland's hotels are well positioned to maintain current levels of recovery and to grow sustainably in the coming years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy will be aware that I am familiar with the beauty of west Cork. I met him there when my family and I were on holidays. I am conscious of the impact on the wider tourism ecosystem, including the businesses he referred to. As regards the TBESS finishing on 28 February, the Government is discussing what will happen next, the supports that are needed and looking at detailed analysis.We in Ireland are absolutely resolute in our solidarity with and support for Ukraine and we are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. We have never seen so many people arrive in such a short timeframe as we welcomed the population size of Galway city in under a year. It is time to remember that Irish people have, over generations, sought shelter and opportunities abroad. Ireland has a long history of supporting other nations in times of trouble and this is the right thing to do. My officials are engaging with several Departments, with input from colleagues from Fáilte Ireland, on how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of the long-term use of tourism accommodation. It was never meant to be long term. It was meant to be short to medium term. This is not just from a hotel's point of view but also for the families in the hotels.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assure the Deputy that the Government did not put such extensive supports in place during Covid for those businesses to close now. My Department and I have extensive and ongoing engagement with the sector. As I said earlier, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I will convene and co-chair the tourism and hospitality forum next week in order to engage and hear concerns. On the 9% VAT rate, as I made clear to Deputy Verona Murphy, I have always said I am in favour of an extension to the lower rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector, that I am acutely conscious of the challenges facing the entire sector and I will be engaging with the Minister for Finance and Cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On 1 December last, I approved the allocation of the remaining €1 million from my Department's commitment to the Galway European Capital of Culture programme to support delivery of the programme under the proposed legacy framework. It is expected that the legacy framework will be published on the website of Galway Culture Company, the successor trading entity to the Galway 2020 company, in the coming weeks. The website of Galway Culture Company, which is fully bilingual, has been live since last Monday and sets out the key high-level programme aims and actions under the legacy framework. The €1 million funding from my Department will be broken down to support the delivery of these programme aims as follows: €300,000 to facilitate EU and international relationships and funding, €500,000 to develop and support place-based cultural programming and €200,000 to provide supports to the cultural and creative sector. Galway Culture Company, operating within Galway City Council and led by a board comprising local and regional leaders of organisations with a role and remit in the support of culture and creative industries in Galway, has already commenced work on facilitating EU and international relationships and funding. For example, it has established an ecosystem of EU supports comprising the key agencies on the board of the company. This inter-agency ecosystem is working to share knowledge and co-operate on EU funding applications. It has already been successful in the award of funding for the stimulating performance of ecosystems in creative territories and regional actors, SPECTRA, project under the Horizon Europe programme. This project is being led by the Western Development Commission in partnership with CREW, Atlantic Technological University and Galway Culture Company as well as a number of partners from other EU countries, including Germany, Bulgaria and Denmark.  Galway Culture Company is working to develop the legacy framework of Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture and to build on the learnings and outcomes of Galway's many European and global designations, including European Capital of Culture, UNESCO city of film, European Green Leaf city and European region of gastronomy.  Over the coming months, open calls will commence for projects under place-based cultural programming as well as the development of actions to support and enhance the capacity of the Galway region's cultural and creative sector. Regular updates on all actions and initiatives, as well as relevant EU and international funding opportunities, will be provided on the website of Galway Culture Company.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, of that €1 million, €500,000 will be to develop and support place-based cultural programming, while €200,000 will be to provide supports to the cultural and creative sector. Galway Culture Company is working to develop the legal framework of Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture and build on the learnings and outcomes. It operates within Galway City Council and is led by a board comprising local and regional leaders of organisations with a role and remit in the support of culture and creative industries in Galway. It is the strategic objective of Galway Culture Company to bring together key agencies and stakeholders to drive forward a collective creative vision for Galway through meaningful partnership and collaboration, so creativity is at the heart of that. It will seek to complement the work of the two local authorities in Galway by working with the cultural units in the city and county councils and will assist in the implementation of both arts plans and the cultural strategy. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I looked at the website and if you look at the itemised breakdown of investment in the local cultural sector during the lifetime of the projects, you can see the investment in local arts. The Deputy may be referring to physical infrastructure as legacy. The bid book for Galway 2020 upon which it was awarded the designation of Ireland's 2020 European Capital of Culture set out that any new cultural infrastructure to be delivered would be part of Galway's culture strategy 2016 to 2020, Everybody Matters, which is developed and managed by the local authorities. The bid book also stated that infrastructure was not part of the European Capital of Culture project, which would rely on existing infrastructure and infrastructure that came on stream between designation and delivery through existing plans and developments. Infrastructure is not and never has been part of the direct delivery and legacy of Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture. I am running out of time but I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Anuraidh, choimisiúnaigh Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann, in éineacht le Foras na Gaeilge agus le tacaíocht ó mo Roinnse, tionscadal taighde chun an leibhéal spéise i seirbhís raidió Gaeilge dírithe ar an aos óg a fháil amach. Bhí dhá chéim ar leith sa tionscadal taighde. Ar an gcéad dul síos, Iorgadh tuairimí sampla ionadaíoch náisiúnta de dhaoine idir 15 agus 34 bliana d'aois maidir leis an spéis a bhí acu in éisteacht le stáisiún Gaeilge agus lena n-oscailteacht ina leith. Ba é an dara gné ná tuairimí phobal na Gaeilge a fháil maidir lena nósanna fuaime agus meán, an cineál ábhair fuaime, idir Bhéarla agus Ghaeilge, a bhfuil siad ag plé leis faoi láthair agus bearnaí a mheastar atá ann i soláthar ábhar Gaeilge. Cé go raibh sé i gceist an taighde a chur i gcrích agus an tuarascáil a tháinig as a fhoilsiú roimh dheireadh na bliana seo caite, tuigim gur thóg cuid den obair allamuigh níos mó ama le críochnú ná mar a ceapadh ar dtús. Mar sin, níor cuireadh na dréacht-tuarascálacha faoi bhráid an údaráis ach i lár mhí na Nollag. Tuigim gur phléigh coiste comhairleach Gaeilge an údaráis na dréacht-tuarascálacha agus go bhfuil siad á n-ullmhú le foilsiú, rud atá beartaithe a dhéanamh sa chéad leath de mhí Feabhra. Rinneadh an taighde chun an oiread tuisceana agus ab fhéidir a fháil ar an éileamh féideartha ar a leithéid de sheirbhís agus ar an gcineál ábhair a bheadh feiliúnach agus a bheadh ar fáil ar aon seirbhís nua. Cabhróidh sé seo le Coimisiún na Meán aon straitéisí nua ceadúnaithe a mheas mar chuid dá ghníomhaíochtaí rialála craolacháin chun a chinntiú go bhfreastalaíonn raon éagsúil seirbhísí craolacháin ar lucht féachana na hÉireann. Samhlaítear go mbeadh aon seirbhís fhéideartha amach anseo hibrideach chun rochtain a thabhairt ar ábhar ar mhodhanna traidisiúnta FM agus digiteacha nó ar líne araon. Tá sé seo ar aon dul leis an moladh ón gCoimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán maidir le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar sheirbhísí Gaeilge, go ndéanfaí scrúdú ar rannpháirtíocht na n-óg, cláir óige agus úsáid níos fearr a bhaint as na meáin dhigiteacha. Cuirtear san áireamh ina leithéid de shamhail hibrideach freisin cumas teicniúil teoranta sheirbhís iomlán FM agus baintear cothromaíocht amach idir lucht féachana FM agus níos mó daoine óga ag dul i dtreo seirbhísí agus ábhar digiteach. Tacaím go láidir le níos mó ábhar agus seirbhísí Gaeilge a sholáthar agus iad a chur ar fáil níos leithne, go háirithe do dhaoine óga. Más féidir an cineál seirbhíse seo a chur i bhfeidhm, ba mhaith liom é a fheiceáil ag tarlú. Níl sé i gceist agam tuilleadh plé a dhéanamh ar na sonraí, toisc gur faoi Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann mar an rialtóir neamhspleách atá sé seirbhísí craolacháin raidió a cheadúnú.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar a luaigh mé i mo fhreagra, ba mhaith liom, más féidir, an cineál seirbhíse seo a fheiceáil i bhfeidhm do dhaoine óga ach tá Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann mar an rialtóir craolacháin neamhspleách atá freagrach as seirbhísí craolacháin raidió neamhspleácha a cheadúnú in Éirinn. Is é an t-údarás, agus ní mise mar Aire, a thionscnaíonn an próiseas ceadúnaithe do sheirbhísí raidió. Faoi láthair, tá 22 seirbhís phobail nó sainspéise ar an aer. Nuair a bheidh toradh thionscadal taighde an údaráis againn, beidh sé riachtanach cinneadh a dhéanamh faoin mbealach is oiriúnaí chun an tseirbhís a sholáthar. Mar a leagtar amach sa reachtaíocht, tá próiseas foirmiúil, reachtúil, rialála ann maidir le seirbhís nua a thabhairt isteach, a dhéanann an rialtóir neamhspleách, Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann, agus ní mór dó go leor gnéithe a chur san áireamh, lena n-áirítear na himpleachtaí a bhaineann le cúnamh stáit.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Creidim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach ar dtús an taighde a fhoilsiú agus deis a thabhairt d’ Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann agus, nuair a chuirfear ar bun é, Coimisiún na Meán, machnamh a dhéanamh ar conas gur féidir eolas a dhéanamh d’aon straitéisí ceadúnaithe amach anseo. Seo cuid den chúis go bhfuil a leithéid de thaighde chomh tábhachtach, ní hamháin chun an leibhéal spéise sa tseirbhís seo a mheas ach chun tuairimí daoine faoi aon bhearnaí sa tseirbhís a mheastar atá ann a fháil amach chomh maith. Tá sé i bhfad róluath labhairt faoi cén tseirbhís a d’fhéadfaí a chur ar fáil sa deireadh, cé a sholáthróidh an tseirbhís sin agus conas a mhaoineofar í, ach is féidir féachaint ar cad iad na tacaíochtaí a cheadófaí agus a d’fhéadfaí a bheith oiriúnach. Bheadh ar thacaíocht den chineál seo teacht le rialacha cúnamh stáit. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, más féidir linn an cineál seirbhíse seo a chur i bhfeidhm do dhaoine óga, ba mhaith liom é sin a fheiceáil.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe this question relates to the vulnerability to blacklisting and failure to vindicate people's rights as employees under EU and national law. The Deputy is following up on the previous question. It is an excellent use of his time.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will answer the question tabled and then get back to the copyright. I understand that the Deputy's question on blacklisting refers to a situation when a person or persons are denied fair opportunities for work or they are discriminated against for one reason or another in gaining employment or both. Employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the mechanisms for dealing with allegations of breaches in the employment laws of the State are under his aegis. These mechanisms are the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court and they are the appropriate forum for dealing with allegations of such breaches. In the event that allegations are upheld, applicant companies for section 481 must provide details of all WRC decisions relating to the qualifying company, the producer company or other companies in the film group, and where those decisions are a finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed must be provided. I am a passionate advocate for diversity. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, I would not condone blacklisting or discrimination of any kind. I have introduced policies that highlight the need for inclusion of all. The work of the skills division of Screen Ireland has been particularly important in improving hiring practices in the audiovisual industry. Screen Ireland states that open hiring practices have increased to the extent that crew calls are now becoming commonplace for most productions. Crew calls mean that there is an open application process so that everyone can apply for crew positions in that production. This is for the industry and those working in it including those who may be marginalised, from minorities or from disadvantaged backgrounds. My Department has been informed that 2022 had the highest number of productions providing placements for disadvantaged groups. More broadly, as I referred to earlier, the Safe to Create programme incorporates zero tolerance of seven damaging behaviours including victimisation. Victimisation occurs when there is adverse treatment of a worker in reaction to a complaint made by the employee or worker. It is intended that free online training in tackling bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias will be undertaken by all in the audiovisual industry. Training in these areas should further protect the rights of vulnerable or marginalised workers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Employment practices in industry have been examined by the WRC. The Deputy had a role in the background on that examination. We constantly monitor the operation of the scheme and work with all stakeholders to bring enhancements where we can. The recent extension of section 481 is a positive development for the sector and all working in it. Without section 481, productions as diverse as "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin" would not be feasible in Ireland. The WRC and Labour Court are independent statutory bodies under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Industrial Relations Act 1946, respectively. They are the mechanisms for regulating employment law in the State. They are under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Both organisations have statutory powers under which they conduct their business and I have no role in their operation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier this morning, I note that Screen Producers Ireland strongly refutes any claim of blacklisting in the Irish film industry-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----and demonstrates its commitment to relations with the unions. If the Deputy knows of a specific instance, or of people to whom it has happened, it is up to him to make a complaint to the appropriate mechanism, which is the WRC. Certain individuals are claiming they have not been able to get a job since. The employment record of any individual is a private matter between him or her and the Department of Social Protection-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----and the individual and the Revenue Commissioners. If the Deputy is aware of a specific incident, it is up to him to make the complaint to the appropriate mechanism, which is the WRC.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 20 together. Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges, both geopolitical and economic, remain. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices, and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry here in Ireland this year. Though the strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year was welcome, there are significant challenges facing the sector. I am, therefore, continuing to direct significant resources to support the sustainable recovery of the sector. In budget 2023, I secured an additional €15 million for the overseas marketing of Ireland. The budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million for the continuation of the investment in skills development and retention, which is critical, as there are significant employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. Additionally, a €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing will continue to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have also secured €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Other allocations include €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development for the continued delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030. Tourism Ireland will roll out an extensive and targeted programme of activity in 2023, with a total marketing budget of €78 million. A wide range of promotional activities will be undertaken, including a new global marketing campaign, publicity and programming, social media and digital marketing, as well as working with the tourism industry at home and the travel trade overseas to facilitate sales. In the area of screen tourism, we can expect many international tourists to head for County Mayo on foot of "The Banshees of Inisherin". Economic, social and environmental sustainability will be at the heart of Tourism Ireland's work over the coming years, driving greater economic prosperity and benefiting communities across the island, while at the same time increasing our consideration of the environmental impacts of tourism. In addition, Fáilte Ireland will announce its plans for 2023 shortly. The Government has recognised the challenge of rapidly rising energy costs for businesses and last year introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS. I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry that the number of tourism beds taken out of the system for humanitarian reasons is likely to have a real impact on the industry's recovery in 2023 and beyond. In addition, hotel accommodation is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families. That is why the Government is actively exploring a wide range of alternative options, including the roll-out of a rapid-build housing programme to provide accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. My Department has communicated concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That Department is working urgently across Government with agencies, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and local authorities to bring new accommodation on board so that the State's humanitarian responsibilities can be met. My Department has initiated the development of a new national sustainable tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years to support sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. The new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable economic development in communities throughout the country while protecting our environment and natural resources, with greater demand spread out across the year. While the sector faces many challenges, I am confident that the supports the Government has put in place will ensure that Ireland's tourism industry is well positioned to maintain its current levels of recovery and to grow sustainably in the coming years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tourism Ireland has been quite fast off the mark. It put up a video on social media maybe three months ago. It shows the actors being interviewed about the beauty of where they worked on location in Achill and Inis Mór. The Deputy can retweet that to his heart's content. It is very aware of the immense value that this will bring to attract international tourists and is capitalising on that. That is another great reason we have tourism, arts and culture in the same portfolio. I have always talked about the links there. In regard to the large country houses, there may be one or two in Kildare north. I can talk with Deputy Durkan afterwards about the potential of that from a tourism point of view. In regard to the conferences, I am aware of that and engage with that specific area in the tourism industry. I expect it to have someone in attendance at the tourism and hospitality forum next week, which is being convened by myself and the Minister, Deputy Coveney. I know Tourism Ireland is aware of the potential there. In regard to the concerns about the humanitarian response, it is, of course, the right thing for us to do. As a nation, we sought refuge for generations and we should never forget that. The Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. The vacant homes initiative led by local authorities aims to provide 1,000 homes while refurbishments led by the Department of House, Local Government and Heritage will provide an estimated 3,000 beds. Under those measures between 6,000 and 7,000 beds or more will come on stream in the coming months to ease the pressure. Of course, I am aware of the concerns in the industry. In particular the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, published reports recently and I have met with its representatives on foot of those reports. I will be engaging with the industry with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the tourism and hospitality forum next week.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the curlew and the yellowhammer, which were mentioned before, some speakers have mentioned existing threats to these birds which are at risk of global extinction. As I am not an expert in this field, perhaps Mr. Copland will confirm that March is a month of nesting, is it not? Is that when they establish territories and so on? Will Mr. Copland confirm whether this Bill will decimate these species? I am thinking of my children. If there are only 120 pairs in Ireland and this Bill then comes in, what happens to the yellowhammer and the curlew for the next generation of children? Will they ever get to see curlews or yellowhammers? On the pilot project to which Mr. Copland referred, how exactly will that work if there are no baseline data? How can we have a pilot project if we do not know where we are starting from? How will we know what damage is done? We talk about common sense. I would have thought data would be needed to work out the results of the pilot. Surely there must be comparisons. I would have thought that. As a follow-on from my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, on the issue of consultation, does anyone know if the Attorney General has been asked to review the legislation in light of the amendments made in the Seanad? Do we know if the Attorney General is satisfied that the provisions of the Bill, particularly those contained in section 8, would be in compliance with the strategic environmental assessment directive and the habitats directive?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am from the stony grey soil of Monaghan. I was born and bred in rural Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Dr. Travers for his presentation and I wish him the best of luck in his role. Dr. Travers mentioned that one of his immediate priorities was a review of existing codes and policies. It made me curious as to when they were last reviewed. Does Dr. Travers know?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What would Dr. Travers see as the stumbling blocks in implementing the goals he set out?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Am I correct in understanding that we are now dealing with programme A and the SNAs?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the question of SNAs, how do we know that the demand is being met? The graph on page 6 of the summary document shows an 11% to 45% variability in increase. Why can we not forecast more accurately? What data are we missing? The target figure, for example, for SNAs in 2015 was 11,330 but the number of SNAs reached by December of 2015 was 12,036. What is the Department basing its targets on? Are the targets needs based? It is quite clear that the demands on the service are continuing to outpace the resources available. I ask the Minister to take steps to address the continuing uncertainty about the allocation of SNAs and, in particular, the timeline for the publication of allocations in advance of the next school year. This is a perennial problem which makes life very difficult for school principals, SNAs, students and parents.  Also under programme A, I wish to refer to the output indicator for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. The indicator holds that a NEPS psychologist is to be assigned to all ordinary national and second-level schools. The indicator does not tell us how we are doing in that regard. Are we meeting demand? What are the waiting lists like? Is every child who needs access to the service getting it within a certain timeframe? If demand jumps, how do we make sure we have sufficient supply? In his previous role as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister advocated for the private sector to have access to the right skills-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am referring to access to the right skills in order to achieve the best outcomes. I ask him to be as proactive in education and to have the vision and commitment to do something similar here to ensure that our children have access to the required amount of trained psychologists and counsellors so that their well being is looked after. I am very disappointed to see no reference whatsoever to resilience in the Estimates. I have spoken to the Minister about this in person. We need to ensure that our children have a toolbox of skills to cope at times of crisis. A rounded education is of paramount importance for our children. I am aware that some secondary schools are doing excellent work in this regard - involving Headstrong, Jigsaw and so forth - where vulnerable teenagers are targeted and their psychological needs addressed. Unfortunately, however, such programmes are sporadic. They must be further developed and designed by experts. We must also consider making such programmes available in primary schools. A more uniform approach is needed in this area. We must move away from a situation where resilience is squeezed into the school day through the efforts of particular teachers who have possibly taken time out and paid for training in this area towards a whole-school approach. I ask the Minister to consider reversing the decision made in the 2012 budget to remove the ex-quota guidance allocation in second level schools. Cuts to such services reduce that crucial, easy access for teenagers when they are in trouble. That decision had a very unequal impact because many schools were able, through parental contributions, to pay for private counsellors. It was the DEIS schools and the disadvantaged students who were crying out for help who had their only trained counsellors taken away. I ask the Minister to consider that as key to the well-being of our children. I note that the provision of additional resource teachers is not included - it is on page 18. Yet there is a reference to a new model which would cost €24 million in 2017, with a full year cost of €72 million. Why is this vital resource not included? At the end of his presentation, the Minister mentioned the €130 million relating to the Lansdowne Road agreement. Is that the money needed to uphold the recent agreement with two of the teacher unions? Is there potential provision if agreement is reached with ASTI? Regarding addressing the inequality for newly qualified teachers, is there provision for reimbursement for loss of earnings for NQTs who have been on reduced pay scale for the past four or five years given that it will have a substantial impact on their pension entitlements?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On that issue, Minister-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I ask a question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If those hours are restored to the counsellors, would it be for the school to decide where those hours go? Could they go elsewhere and not into counselling?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As regards the Lansdowne Road agreement, the €130 million does not include the two teacher unions so there is no provision if the ASTI comes on board.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Minister have any intention of addressing the pension impacts on NQTs? For the past four years they have been doing the same work.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have a quick question on capital. On page 11 it appears that the capital building programme has exceeded its budget, yet on page 79 it is stated the target is to build 50 schools this year, but only 14 have been completed at the end of September. Is there a budget to complete the other 36? There are many references to significant pressure on the capital budget, but in the programme for Government there is an intention to introduce physical education, PE, to the leaving certificate programme. Will there be a budget provision to review second level schools? I am aware of a school in my constituency that opened in 1980 but which still does not have a PE hall. Where is the equal access in that instance? How can it and other schools provide for PE classes? It is a case of putting the cart before the horse. The Minister must check that the schools have PE halls and proper PE facilities before the introduction of PE to the leaving certificate programme. With regard to higher-level education, it is indicated on page 13 that universities and institutes of technology required the earlier payment of grants in 2016. Why was this? Why are the universities and institutes of technology underwater already? As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, third level cannot wait for us to debate the Cassells report. There is now a crisis and the chickens have well and truly come home to roost. How will the Government address this in the upcoming budget? Funding is needed now. I noticed there is no budget to make progress on the junior cycle policy reforms. That is quite astounding. This is the major reform that is happening in second-level schools. The policy reform is actively happening so it is a problem if there is no budget to progress it. There is no budget for certain forthcoming initiatives, such as the Gaeltacht strategy. Will the budgets for these initiatives be found?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is not a problem. I welcome the witnesses, a few of whom I have met already. It is appalling that they are being left in limbo. I think it was John F. Kennedy who said that education should be the greatest equaliser of all. There is no level playing field in this situation at all, and I am a firm believer in equal access. I was particularly struck by Mr. Byrne's contribution when he said that he lost his grant when he crossed the road. Following on from Deputy Byrne's question, will the witnesses clarify they are only seeking the maintenance grants? I submitted a parliamentary question on this matter and got quite a convoluted answer, at the end of which the Minister stated, "It is open to private higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to students that they consider to be in financial difficulty." I am curious to know whether that happens. Is there any sort of support being offered in any of these colleges? Finally, I agree with the other members about the lack of clarity. I think it was Ms Houlihan who, when I met her, said she was excited to get the course she wanted only to find out she would not get the necessary support. We need to tackle that obstacle as a committee for the witnesses.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ms Houlihan mentioned in her presentation that she met the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and she seems to be aware of the Cassells report. Did the Minister indicate any opinion on this or will he leave it to the committee?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome Mr. Horgan and thank him for his presentation. The previous chief executive, Mr. Tom Boland, retired in July. I believe his replacement announced that she would only be staying on for a few months. It is a key position. Is Mr. Horgan aware of plans to fill it? The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, appeared before the committee a few weeks ago to brief us on the mid-year expenditure review. The reference to the early payment of grants to universities and institutes of technology is worrying. Were grants paid earlier because they were under water? Were they paid early because the institutions were running out of money and reaching insolvency? Does Mr. Horgan have a handle on the overall scale of problem with their cash flows? I believe the last real benchmark report on third level institutions was produced in 2013 and indicated a significant decline. I know that we have had some quantitative and qualitative data since. When will the HEA produce the next benchmark report to measure accurately the impacts on third level education in the past few years? I raise the question of gender. When I was preparing for this meeting, I learned on the HEA's website that in Ireland 81% of professional positions were held by men. While women comprised 62% of non-academic staff, men comprised 72% of the highest paid. While there are four female presidents of institutes of technology, there has never been a female president of a university in the Republic. Recent media reports indicate that some institutes are struggling in meeting the challenge of gender equality. I welcome the strides made in some colleges. DCU recently renamed a significant number of buildings after accomplished women. Because of initiatives such as Athena and Swan, 50% of candidates who are short-listed must be female. What has the HEA learned to date in this regard and is there more that could be done?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Has Mr. Horgan a contingency plan in place in case there is a holding period?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I might pursue that with Mr. Horgan at a later stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Institutions flagged as borderline and their future are of concern to me, particularly if they are underwater.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Institutional and sectoral progress.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Good.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move:That the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills asks the Minister for Education and Skills to move quickly to put in place a plan B to protect those students who might lose out on 10% of their grade in English due to the ongoing dispute between the ASTI and the Government.Recently, the Minister for Education and Skills appeared before the committee and said that he could not guarantee that junior cycle students sitting the English course would not lose out on 10% of their grades next year. This is causing them and their parents considerable worry and uncertainty. Talks are continuing, but a plan B is needed. Since we do not know what the end result of the talks will be, the Minister must put a plan B in place for the students. It should not be the case that thousands of junior cycle English students will enter exam halls next June knowing that they are down 10% before they even put pen to paper. That would be unacceptable. The Minister has a duty to put a contingency plan in place. The results of the ballot will be revealed tomorrow and, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, the ASTI is protesting outside Leinster House today, but we need to put our children front and centre. I appeal to the Minister to address this issue. The aim of my motion is to put a plan B in place in order that no students are worried as they face their first State examinations. They are already worried. I am a former English teacher. I know how stressed out students get. There is so much talk about the stresses upon students these days. Given that the first State exam places them under extreme stress, can we not soothe their worries and their parents' worries by showing that, if the dispute continues into June, the Department and the Minister will take action and put a plan in place?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have moved my motion. I will not be supporting the amendment because it seeks to remove the action which I believe is needed to protect the children and to signal to the Minister that he needs to ensure they do not lose the 10%. I am aware that the talks are ongoing but I believe the Minister needs to put a contingency plan in place. On the point regarding undermining the integrity of the examination, I do not believe that is the case. There are already alternative models in operation which could help resolve this problem and provide a guarantee to students that they will not be adversely affected. For example, students who do not participate in the oral component of examinations at junior cycle have their written examinations marked out of 100%. This means that students who do not take the oral component of a language examination do not automatically lose marks. This model, or an alternative, may not be ideal but we have to accept the urgent need to have a contingency plan in place. It must be acknowledged that putting in place such planning requires a great deal of preparation and as such the process needs to start now.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In terms of procedure, when does one withdraw an amendment?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not want the motion, as amended, being sent to the Dáil.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What is before us now is a completely different animal to the motion I put forward.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that down to me?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to put on the record that I will withdraw it but the reason being the amendment has completely turned the motion on its head and would put the dispute front and centre, which is not needed. My motion was about putting the child, that is, the children suffering as a result of the dispute, front and centre. For the record, I am withdrawing the motion because the nature of it has completely changed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Ms Griffin for her presentation. I have been crossing off questions as they have been asked, she will be glad to hear, as there were a good few. I welcome and acknowledge the substantial work that has gone into this new model and indeed into the report on ASD. When it comes to children with special educational needs there is, unfortunately, the element of schools cherry-picking students and I believe we need to do something to end that discrimination. The league tables are becoming the top priority. I am aware of cases where siblings who attend a certain school are told, when the younger sibling has a special educational need, that he or she would be better off going to the other school. I am also curious about the whole school evaluation and the management, leadership and learning review - and I do not know if this has arisen as an issue - in a school which may have a lot of children who have special educational needs. As part of the review or at the end of the evaluation the school is often asked if they have questioned why they are not achieving great grades as a whole school. I wonder if the schools that do not take in children who have special educational needs are asked why they do not have a lot of children who have special educational needs. I believe that question needs to start appearing on inspection reviews to guarantee equality of access for all students and to end that cherry-picking. Is assessment wholly dependent upon the standardised tests or will the learning support departments - or the support teachers as they are now called - have a whole suite of tests to help identify the needs? I definitely welcome the 900 new resource teachers in 2017, but is there a contingency plan if the new model reveals that demand outweighs the supply? I understand that the schools would be required to provide annual reports on how the new model is working. Is this something new and how does it fit in? I am very aware that school managements are under severe pressure. I completely acknowledge that the reports would be needed, but is there an amount of liaison needed to help with management and middle management etc.? With regard to the ASD report, which is a great report, I have looked at similar policies in Northern Ireland and in the UK and I have noticed that the one thing that is not in this ASD report, which is in those other reports, is a definition for what ASD is. Why is that definition not there? It would be very helpful. I may not have seen it in this report but when it comes to supporting children who have autism, around break time for example, does the Department see a need to recognise the sensory overloads that can happen at that time and the need for quiet spaces, as may exist in other countries' schools, and how would that be resourced in a school? I very much welcome the whole school community approach and that it is not just about the teacher; it is the caretaker, the driver and the man or woman who works in the canteen. I welcome that there will be training in that area also. When the appropriate curriculum is being considered for the 63% of children who are in mainstream and doing the traditional junior cycle or leaving certificate, is it still not the case that the child fits the curriculum rather than the curriculum fitting the child? I am aware of a child who is on the spectrum and who was doing music as a subject for the traditional leaving certificate. Three months into the course the teacher discovered that the child had a severe reaction to classical music. The curriculum obviously does not suit the child and yet that child wants to do music as a subject. There are elements there with the curriculum. Part of the curriculum at leaving certificate applied, LCA, and transition year, TY, is gaining of work experience. Sometimes children who are on the spectrum find it very hard to fit in there or to find relevant and suitable work experience. Are there support mechanisms when it comes to TY and LCA?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was not suggesting it as a reaction. I have been a teacher and know of students who would opt to avail of such a space because, perhaps, a canteen environment might not suit them. I was not suggesting quiet spaces be used for time out or as punishment but rather that they be available where a child has identified a need for them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The document refers to the provision of training for the whole school community. That is welcome as it is essential that the view is not taken that only teachers should provide learning support.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The implementation group might also look at the position for leaving certificate applied students because many schools have adopted a policy under which students will only gain work experience one day per week. It is vital that children on the autism spectrum have support available one day every week.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A question on the definition was not answered.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Aontaím leis an Teachta Nolan. We were neither informed nor invited. It is highly regrettable that the stakeholders, who have been putting the pressure on and who contributed, were not advised that this is happening. It is not the first occasion something such as this has happened. We were not invited to the launch of the action plan either. Do we agree that we will write a letter in the name of the committee stating that we are to be informed and to express our regret that we were not invited to the launches of the two main strategies?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Do we also agree to include in the letter that we are seeking a meeting? Agreed.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The chances of getting a meeting in the near future are slim, but we will make the request. We will also express our regret and seek information on and invitations to future events.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the group for the continued work that they do in this sector. I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations on the huge challenges that face universities. I echo what other members of the committee have said about ensuring students from disadvantaged areas can access third level education. At this late stage of the meeting some of my questions have already been answered.  I have a question about increasing the number of non-EU students who pay the full amount of fees. I was going to ask if there is a capacity for doing so but I think the witnesses have indicated that serious capital investment is needed to increase the number of places taken up by non-EU students. A few members have mentioned the national training fund. The witnesses have called for the fund to be used for third level education. I ask the witnesses to elaborate on how such a scheme should work? How are universities with large financial deficits funded from a cashflow perspective? Do they draw down funding early from the HEA? Do they borrow funding from the HEA? If so, how will the moneys be paid back? The witnesses have said funding needs to be increased. Would that funding be sucked into paying back the deficit before reaching crucial areas?  Senator Gallagher mentioned the concerns about drop-out rates. He asked whether the reduction in the number of guidance counsellors at second level was a factor in the increase in drop-out rates. I have spoken to many students and groups of students at third level who have stated that there are waiting lists of 18 months for counselling services at third level, never mind second level. Is that a factor in drop-out rates too? What can be done to address the problem?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentation. They said they moved from an overall surplus of €40.8 million in 2008 to a deficit of €2.7 million in 2014-15. Like others I read the recent Higher Education Authority, HEA, review which shows six ITs under immediate financial pressure. What would the biggest deficit in any one IT be? Is it able to pay bills as they fall due? If not, what are the implications of that? How is it currently funded from a cashflow perspective? Would increased funding be sucked into paying deficits like this? They mentioned that reserves fell from €132.5 million to €78.7 million, wiping out 40% of finance available to underpin ongoing sustainability. What exactly does that mean? Can the witnesses elaborate on that? What are their target reserves? In the recent HEA report there is a reference to human resources flexibility. Is that part-time lecturers to save on costs or what is it? If that is the case, have any of these lecturers acquired employment rights over this period and if so what has been done to regularise that and what are the financial implications of that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome Mr. Cassells and Dr. Doris and thank them for producing a report which appears to have earned the respect of all the relevant stakeholders. Needless to say, I fully concur that higher education has been at the heart of the country's transformation and needs to be fully restored to make it a key enabler of future development. Access is a key concern and one I share with other members. I taught in a DEIS school in Dublin for more than 16 years and I have known children who were the first in their family to attend college. Choosing to go to college is a major decision for such children and their families. It is important, therefore, that such children can make a smooth transition into third level education. I am concerned that a loans system would cause a child from a disadvantaged background to stop and wonder if he or she or his or her family are willing to take on the burden of a loan. This factor must be taken into consideration. There is a significant deficit in third level supports for students with mental health issues. We hear, for example, of waiting lists of 18 months to access services and many universities and institutes of technology have noted a marked increase in the number of students with mental health issues. As the witnesses pointed out, the current system fails to recognise the pressures placed on families and students by fees and high living and maintenance costs. We must not increase the pressures and burden on students as this would cause even greater mental health problems when supports are not available to them. It is assumed that 20% of graduates will emigrate and 10% will remain abroad permanently. It is a serious concern that a loans scheme would incentivise graduates to stay abroad permanently on the basis of a conservative assumption that they would not repay any of the loan while living abroad. Would a loans scheme result in the country bleeding its most talented graduates? That is a major concern. I ask Mr. Cassells to elaborate on the loans students may face. He indicated that smaller student-teacher ratios are a desired outcome of a student loans system. The student-teacher ratio varies significantly between colleges and courses. Is it possible that, for example, students studying architecture would end up with a larger student loan than, for example, business studies students given the differences in funding required to run architecture and business courses? The former are more labour and materials intensive than the latter. Mr. Cassells noted that the presidents of the universities appeared before the joint committee two weeks ago. At that meeting, they stated that the national training fund is projected to be in substantial surplus by the end of 2017, to the tune of €272 million. What are the witnesses' views on the possibility of directing some of this surplus into funding third level education? How precisely does he envisage this would be done? If additional moneys are to be allocated to third level education, how can we ensure they go directly to students? There is a consensus in the health sector that money should follow the patient. How can we ensure that, where funding to third level is increased, the money will follow the student to ensure it yields an improved student experience and better learning outcomes?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the deputations for their presentations. We are all in agreement that we cannot continue with things as they are. Until something changes, the quality of education in Ireland - something we have always been proud of - will plummet. I have concerns similar to those raised by other members in respect of access. I taught in a DEIS school for 16 years and I have seen the joy when the first child in a family declares intent to go to third level. I have concerns that this move would diminish that incentive and that the loan would frighten the child, especially when they turn to parents who do not fit the typical support model to which the rest of us may be accustomed. They may not get the necessary support at home. Those are my thoughts on that point. I am keen to hear from all the deputations on the potential impact of loans on emigration. The statistics show that 20% of graduates emigrate and 10% emigrate on a permanent basis. If it is the case that a person who stays abroad would not have to pay back the loans - it appears that it might be - will this lead to a complete brain drain? Will our most wonderful and brilliant graduates stay abroad rather than repay? One impact is that the loans would not be paid back and we would suffer the loss of wonderful graduates. That needs to be explored. How does Dr. Day see Brexit impacting on our universities and institutes of technology? My final question is a general question for all three deputations. I am curious about the drop-out rates, including the drop-out rates from universities to institutes of technology and from institutes of technology to post leaving certificate courses. When students discover a lack of suitability and change around there is a loss of fees. Is there a broader issue? Do we need to explore something like the dual system in Germany? Would that help to address it? Is that something this country should explore?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is great to hear all three of the presenters today. While there may not be consensus here on how education should be funded, everyone would be in agreement that the three presenters are wonderful ambassadors for the youth of the country. I say, "Well done," on fantastic presentations and how they care for the future generations. The concerns I expressed earlier were particularly highlighted by Ms Hayes-Nally's presentation. When one thinks of a family of five ranging in age from 17 to ten, already Ms Hayes-Nally is worried about a burden of €100,000 being placed on her family. I note the love that her mother has given her for education and how obvious is the love that Ms Hayes-Nally has for her Mum, and that Ms Hayes-Nally is concerned that her mother may loose her daughter, as we expressed earlier the concern about emigration. How do all three presenters answer those who say this is not a loan as we know it? How do they answer the assertion that this is not a mortgage, it is not the typical debt and one will not be saddled with debt for life? How do they answer that? Ms Hoey rightly pointed out that when we talk about access it is getting in, staying in and beyond. Often I have mentioned here the deficit in resources in college. Ms Hoey mentioned the path to resources in keeping students in college that is lacking because of that deficit. Ms Hoey referred to the USI having done research on publicly funded models in other countries. Would Ms Hoey, or indeed, Mr. McNulty, elaborate on what the USI found out from that and the impact it has had on the countries in question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. Richard Kennedy for his presentation. As with my colleagues, I would like clarity on his position on income contingent loans. I have concerns, as I say every time we discuss the Cassells report, about equality of access to education and these income contingent loans. We could lose our most skilled graduates to emigration because if they emigrate they will probably not be chased to repay the loans. How much more will employers be willing to pay into the national training fund? At the moment, it raises €350 million but ICTU want it to be raised to €700 million. What say does ICTU currently have over how that €350 million is spent? If it was increased, what say would it like to have?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What are the suggestions of the other organisations on how an opt-out would work? The spotlight has not sufficiently been put on the discrimination children with special educational needs experience when it comes to school entrance. It is appalling and is happening regularly.There may be six secondary schools in an area and there is a practice whereby principals tell parents to go to this or that school. The league tables published last week only encourage that practice. That is not how our children should be judged and is not the education we should provide for them. There is an argument that the power of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, should be expanded to allow it to compel schools to take on children with special educational needs and that schools should be able to provide the proper resources. It is not enough to say a school must accept a child unless there are enough resources. What is Ms Corr's opinion of that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I apologise for being late and missing the contributions of the witnesses but I have read the written statements that were submitted beforehand. I have a couple of questions. Ar dtús, maidir le hionchur an Fhorais Pátrúnachta, aontaím gur chóir tús áite a thabhairt do dhaltaí na nGaelscoileanna. Sílim go bhfuil riachtanas ann go ndéanfadh Rialtas na tíre agus polaiteoirí na dTithe uaisle seo gach iarracht chun gur féidir linn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar fud an oileáin seo. Cabhróidh an réamhamharc seo le coincheap an tumoideachais agus le todhchaí na teanga sa lá ata inniu ann mar theanga náisiúnta agus mar mhionteanga de chuid na hEorpa. I have a general question for all the witnesses. If we could find agreement, what do they believe should be the top three criteria for admissions to schools that are oversubscribed? I would be interested to hear the variance in opinions. Is it linear distance, siblings, place on waiting lists, religion, etc.? I have a question for the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, on the survey referenced in the submission. Of the 72 schools that did not complete the survey, were those schools concentrated in one area or spread across the greater Dublin area? Of the 1.2% of applications - approximately 80 - that were refused over issues relating to a baptism certificate, were those applications concentrated in a specific area? This is an issue that is regularly raised with me by parents in the constituency of Dublin-Rathdown. How is the ESRI's 20% figure for oversubscription explained? It is a huge difference. Do we know what difference in the methods used in gathering the data might have given such results?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In response to what Mr. Mulconry said, it is something I have raised consistently in the Dáil and at this committee. I am very aware of the discrimination against children with special educational needs. I have come across schools that have taken in children, but the siblings with special educational needs are told to go to the school down the road. It is outrageous. It is not helped - I have also raised this issue - by the fact that the MLL inspectors will ask the school at the end of the week of the inspection why it has such a large proportion of children with special educational needs, but they never ask the school, which does not have children with special needs, why it does not have children with special educational needs or why it has such a small proportion of them. I am very aware of that issue. I acknowledge and commend the work consistently done by all groups represented here in nurturing our children.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Go raibh maith agaibh as ucht teacht anseo inniu agus cur i láthair chomh mionsonraithe a dhéanamh. I thank the delegates so much for their detailed presentations. I commend them on their excellent work on children's mental health, which represents such a vital field. I, for one, welcome that, finally in recent years, the spotlight is on our children's mental health and on placing it front and centre in education. I have just a few questions. Mr. King is a great advocate of mindfulness and has an excellent knowledge base. Is he in favour of his programme being integrated into the school system or rolling it out in general? How does he envisage this happening? At what age should we start teaching mindfulness? What standard of training do teachers need? Is there a certain qualification? Is mindfulness suited to all children or not? Is there a danger also? Do we have to be very careful about how mindfulness is delivered in our schools? It is very important that schoolchildren receive support with mental health issues but sometimes the teachers are forgotten about. How can we support our teachers? If we are talking about positive mental health in our schools, what is the position on the whole school staff and community? How do we encourage and ensure positive mental health among them? At the beginning of Dr. Bates's submission, he referred to post-primary schools. Does he work with primary schools? If not, why? Is it a matter of resources? I am curious about that. Do schools refer students for the wonderful supports that Jigsaw provides? If so, how is it done? Is it done by the principal, a specific teacher or guidance counsellor? Is there any way of monitoring an identified child when they leave school, or is the child suddenly left without the supports? Can students always access the external supports they need? Does it vary according to the luck of the draw based on where one lives in the country? Are there considerable waiting lists for the supports? Mr. Hussey referred to the aesthetic engagement that is not available in our schools. Is there potential to provide that in our schools? I think specifically of the new junior cycle and the short courses. I have taken on board what Mr. Hussey said on the need for delivery by experts in the field. Can short courses be designed and given in certain schools? Should we be considering this? The NCCA has a short course on artistic performance but does it take on board any of the expertise to which Mr. Hussey referred regarding aesthetic engagement?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank everyone for their presentations. I concur with Senator Gallagher in commending Deputy Daly on bringing this Bill forward. Due to his knowledge of the legislation, he has already raised the relevant questions. I would be interested in coming back later to discuss the parent and student charter Bill. I have one question for Dr. Muldoon. Currently, what are the biggest stumbling blocks or obstacles he sees in his work when it comes to dealing with education, which is 45% of his workload?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mr. McLoughlin said that the Department will put the flesh on the charter and then it would go to consultation with working groups, which I presume will be students and parents. Then there will be individual charters by school, because obviously there cannot be a one-size fits all as there is huge variation in the make-up of school communities. How will the consultation with parents and students in the individual schools work? In the more disadvantaged areas it can be impossible to get a parent to turn up to a parent-teacher meeting. If it is a student council, often it is the most vulnerable, most needy child that does not put themselves up for election, so how will their voice be heard in that context? I refer to Mr. Cotrell's remarks. Will it be the principal who will drive the individual charter in the school, as secretary to the board of management? I wholeheartedly agree that principals and senior management, due to the moratorium, are under serious work overload. I am aware of someone in a DEIS school who works as the principal, the assistant principal - which in this case is the year-head where there are huge pastoral care issues because it is a DEIS school - and is also now the student council teacher because they cannot get the B post replaced. When we talk about the welfare of students, there are huge issues that need to be addressed, and not just dealt with in the parent and student charter.  Ms Dempsey raised an interesting point that the balance of power is often with the board of management. That is problematic when there is a perception that it is swayed by principals. Has the Department considered re-examining the make-up of boards of management? The reality is that some of the membership there hinges on which party wins in a local election because there would be public representatives on a lot of the boards of management.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, in secondary schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That needs to be addressed too and should be brought into the open. Public representatives and community activists may be involved in other schools too. I do not know if that is necessarily a good thing for the student or the parents, for interviewing teachers. This is something that needs to be brought into the open. If we are talking about students, is it time to seriously consider putting students at second level on boards of management? Naturally, they would be recused for confidential matters. Some schools will have student councils address boards of management once or twice a year but these do not have a real or serious input into decision making.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I come from the position that we must stop viewing education as a cost but as the investment it is. I wish to delve more into the potential impact of these income-contingent loans on emigration. We are a country that suffers from emigration and with a youth unemployment rate of 14%, are we not at huge risk of shedding our talented graduates? It is very alarming to see how New Zealand is dealing with this. It is basically monitoring graduates living outside New Zealand for arrest when they return. We do not want to see that happen to our graduates in Ireland. We want to hold them in our country and encourage them to stay here. Before I was elected to the Dáil, I was a teacher for 16 years in a DEIS school. Consequently, I am very aware of the student who is first in his or her family. It is a complete departure to consider entering third level. They need to be held and encouraged along the line by family and by school. It took my breath away to see in Dr. Doris's and Dr. Flannery's submission the proposal for an incentive to pay upfront. Obviously, there is not a tad of understanding for the student who can never, ever imagine paying upfront. It is completely unfair when we should be addressing equality of access and opportunity in education. Talk about being blind to the very children we should be targeting to bring into third level. These are gifted children for whom the cost is stopping them from entering third level. Not only do I feel it is wrong for the student but I also believe there is a risk to the State when we consider countries in which the payback rate is as low as 30%; the one in six dropouts, as was referred to, a rate which rises to 26% in our institutes of technology, the potential for default through emigration and two recessions 20 years apart. Then we see on page 84 of the Cassells report that the estimation is €10 billion of debt in the first 20 years. That leads us into the next cycle, which, as mentioned, could be a recession. Is that €10 billion of debt therefore vastly underestimated when one takes all of this into consideration? Finally, Senator Ruane raised the issue of gender but it struck me today: what happens to the stay-at-home parents, be they mothers or fathers, who go to work and then decide instead they want to stay at home with their children? What happens in that scenario?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If a person starts repaying and then becomes a parent, can repayments stop?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I certainly agree with Mr. Dermot Carey. It sounds like some sort of nationwide campaign to promote apprenticeships is needed, perhaps on social media or television, and it needs to happen soon. My question for all groups is about what could be done to attract more women to apprenticeships. Mr. Michael Hourihan from Cork Institute of Technology says that there is a need to examine apprenticeship programmes in other countries. Is the German dual programme one that he thinks we should be working towards? What are his thoughts on how career guidance could be improved? What sort of links do the different sectors have with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors? I presume that the cuts to guidance counsellors in 2012 must have had an impact, because there would have been schools which could afford to pay for those hours, and unfortunately the schools which would traditionally have the students that might be attracted to apprenticeships are those that did not have guidance counsellors or could not afford to pay for a guidance counsellor. Did that have an impact in the past five years? My question for Mr. Des Murphy of Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, is on the two-year pre-apprenticeship programme. How would that work alongside the leaving certificate applied programme? Is it time to totally overhaul that? That was introduced 22 years ago so is that something we need to look at? My final question is whether there are aspects of the education system which negatively affect the perception of apprenticeships, for example, the points system and the league tables. We are all aware of certain schools that might suddenly decide to drop the leaving certificate applied option because they want to be able to attract parents who want to put students into a school that might perform better on the league tables and do not really want the leaving certificate applied programme there. How do we get that shift in cultural mindset that is so badly needed to serve our children better? Rather than serving a league table, surely we should be serving the education of our children better. Do we need to shift the leaving certificate applied option into a proper apprenticeship programme for students?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Have efforts been made to link in with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and say there is a need for this-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all the witnesses for their presentations today. I agree with those who said that "service provider" is not a way to describe schools. It is a huge disservice to what happens in schools across the country. Is áthas liom go bhfuil áiseanna aistriúcháin againn inniu agus gur féidir le Mr. Ó hEagra a chur i láthair a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. Cinnte, aontaím leis nach bhfuil go leor acmhainní sna scoileanna agus go bhfuil a lán príomhoidí ag obair gan lár-bhainistíocht chun tacú leo. An gcreideann Mr. Ó hEagra gur chóir do dháltaí suí ar na boird bainstíochta sna scoileanna? Ms Salmon of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, recommended inserting a new paragraph which would say that "Parents will co-operate with the Parent and Student Charter and recognise their responsibilities to be active and involved in their child’s education." How does she envisage schools dealing with parents in scenarios where, unfortunately, parents are either unwilling or uninterested in getting involved? How can parents be made to co-operate without their lack of co-operation having an adverse effect on their child?  I note Ms Salmon is not in favour of having students on boards of management. Surely it is possible for student members to be recused from certain areas, such as issues of discipline and so on, while at the same time having a valuable contribution. I am aware that there are student councils and active student voices within our schools but unfortunately, due to the squeeze on middle management, many schools do not have a student council staff liaison officer. It is a very important role. That essential staff member, who holds the hand of the student council at the very beginning, is absent. Indeed, even in some of Ms Salmon's own schools the principal is acting as that co-ordinator. Therefore the student councils are suffering and their voice might not be heard with the strength it could be.  Does Ms Salmon believe it is time to review how boards of management are formed? I am aware that in many schools after local elections, for example, there is a scramble for whatever political party that got the majority to get onto the boards of management. Does that necessarily put the right people on the boards of management, when they do not have experience in the field of education or in services for children? They are chairing interview panels for teachers when they have absolutely no educational experience. The student teacher who has just qualified sometimes has more experience than the person who is chairing the panel, who is sometimes just there because he or she is from the right political party at the right time. That same question applies to all witnesses across the board. Where that is happening, do we need to review our boards of management to make sure they are working properly for our students and for our schools? As Deputy Jim Daly said, some parents feel some schools in certain places are closed shops and parents who want to get on boards, cannot.  In respect of the boards of management again, I see that Educate Together has second level students on the boards. Will Mr. Rowe expand on how this works and what he feels is most effective about it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was playing devil's advocate.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that the recipe for the best person? Undoubtedly some great people make it onto the boards but it comes down to politics, which is what I was querying. The board of management has to deal with who it gets. Sometimes they are brilliant. I was wondering if that has to be reviewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I acknowledge that. The work that schools do to encourage parents is never acknowledged. It is under the radar but I am aware that it happens.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I apologise for having to leave after I ask my questions but I will look at the answers later. It states in the submission that the processes for which Caranua has time standards are met at an average of 90% of the time. Can Ms Higgins give us an idea of which processes these are and how Caranua comes up with these time standards? It also states that the number of complaints received was small compared to the volume of interactions relating to applications. In an article in The Irish Times in March, Ms Higgins was quoted as saying that "some applicants will never be happy" and "You can't control people's experience of what we do for them". She went on to say, "It's never going to be enough to satisfy them and make them feel cared for, loved, honoured or whatever else". Does she accept that the language she used is highly regrettable? These are survivors in their twilight years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The language is of huge concern, considering Ms Higgins's role. The survivors are in their twilight years and have already been appallingly treated by the State. Such language does a huge disservice to them. I find it hard to believe the contention in the submission that Caranua is unaware of the reports of dissatisfaction on the part of many people in their dealings with the organisation, when these reports have been made available to the general public. Caranua means "new friend" but survivors feel there is no friendship in the organisation. Why did the management implement the prioritisation policy and how did it believe it could be justified under the legislation? What was the rationale for a general policy which put all reapplicants, whether they have been awarded small or large sums, into the same deprioritisation category? Surely the board's primary function is to accept process and to determine applications. Caranua sent out 2,500 letters on foot of this policy from November 2015. Do the people involved have a right to appeal? Did the organisation inform them of a right to appeal? In September 2016, Caranua accepted that this was an oversight on its part but it has done nothing to deal with the issues. How many of the 2,500 people involved has Caranua written to? Does it intend to contact all of them to clarify their rights? How exactly did Caranua come to the figure of €15,000 as a limit?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am very interested in this issue. I taught for 16 years in a DEIS school which had a huge cohort of children with varied special educational needs. I am completely aware of where resources are lacking. The issue is, therefore, very close to my heart. I have a couple of questions which I will not field to anybody in particular.  On the workload of educational welfare officer, is there a maximum number of schools an officer can look after? Is it a problem? Can up to 30 or 40 schools be assigned to one officer? How can an officer possibly track non-attendance if he or she has such a vast number of schools to look after? In respect of reduced and limited timetables which may have been mentioned by Dr. Ryan, are there specific guidelines or structures for schools or is the issue managed on a school-by-school basis? Is it the case that school A could be doing it one way, while school B down the road might be using a different way altogether? I was interested in the suggestion of co-teaching. I did some as part of the Droichead scheme about four years ago when a student teacher came and it worked very well. There were also two SNAs in the room with 18 students. I thought it was fantastic and it happened to work very well as the student teacher and I happened to work well together. How are teachers chosen? It is important to make sure they can work with another teacher. Even 14 years ago, some teachers did not know how they would cope with an SNA in the room. How would having a co-teacher and a few SNAs work when it comes to inspection, for example? How will the experienced teacher be trained to co-teach? I have heard anecdotal evidence that resource teaching hours are sometimes used as a timetable filler to have a teacher work a certain period of hours, rather than choosing the best teacher to do the resource teaching hours. Is that something that happens and how can the practice be tackled? In respect of students who do not take Irish, there is an issue that presents after the junior certificate examinations. There are students with special educational needs and those for whom English is not their first language, as well as others who, for various reasons, have an exemption. At leaving certificate level Irish is taught every day. In some schools there are more students in a class who are not doing Irish. A school can end up with 32 to 34 17-year-olds who are exempt from the class. I do not think there is any guideline for dealing with this issue. It seems to be about classroom control where the teacher tries to keep the students quiet for 40 minutes. Could we tap into this resource to do something powerful to help students for whom English is not their first language or who have special educational needs? A lot of the time there are no SNAs assigned to that group. I am curious about the numbers at level 2 and the provision of proper training and how the strike affected the position. Just before the strike started, I sat the level 2 examination in English and at that stage there were no guidelines for it. When I asked the question at the end of the day, I was only taught to level 3. I do not know what has happened since. On the applied leaving certificate programme, I believe that for a lot of children with special educational needs, it is about getting them through the junior certificate examinations and then they opt to take the applied leaving certificate programme. Does it serve them well? The programme has been in place a long time without being reviewed. If one takes the level 2 or level 1 programme, as suggested, can one progress to the applied leaving certificate programme or will it stop a student from progressing beyond third year?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations. My first question is directed to the representatives of the Department and Bus Éireann. What is being done to ensure that drivers and escorts have the relevant training in special education needs? Having taught in many schools for children with special educational needs, I know that not only teachers but all staff need training in special educational needs because when it comes to many of the basic interactions we take for granted, without an understanding of disabilities, in particular autism spectrum disorder, issues can escalate. We should be seeking to ensure that all drivers and escorts undergo basic training in this area. In regard to the establishment of "nearest recognised school", one of the criteria is that a copy be provided of the decision reached following an appeal under section 29 in respect of refusal of entry to a school. Often, a primary school will have only one class which fills up quickly every year such that it is obvious to a parent that a child will not get a place in that school and so the parent does not engage in the section 29 process. Is there any leeway in such cases? In other words, is there any point putting the parent and the school through a section 29 process when it is obvious to everybody there is no way the child can be accommodated in the school? A school in my constituency, Ballinteer Educate Together, is awaiting a permanent building and is to be relocated outside of the catchment area to Churchtown, which is beyond the 3.2 km for parents to travel. Other schools that are temporarily located are also being moved outside of their catchment areas when planning permissions are unsuccessful. The children currently attending the Ballinteer Educate school are able to walk to the school but following its relocation to Churchtown they will not be able to do so. Many of their parents do not have cars and so the children will need school transport. What arrangements, if any, are put in place where this happens?  In regard to special educational needs, the phrase "nearest school which is or can be resourced to meet their needs" was mentioned. Am I correct that if a parent identifies the nearest school as not having the resources to meet his or her child's needs that school can be so resourced? If I have a child with special educational needs I would be seeking to enrol him or her in a school that has special education needs provision in place which has been tried, tested and is working. In terms of special needs allocations, if a parent seeks provision on behalf of a child at what point does the school apply for the resources identified? At a recent cross-party meeting on school transport, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, the issue of the 4,000 school transport vehicles and the 100 million km covered by them annually. What consideration, if any, is being given to the use of bio-fuels or electric vehicles? As a country, we need to reduce our emissions and this small change could help us in achieving our climate change targets.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for coming in to give a statement on such a serious issue. I have just a few questions. To reiterate what Deputy Byrne has said, why did it take so long to publish the reports? Why would a principal have to write to the Department seven times to ensure pupils' safety? Why was the Minister's Department so reluctant to give that information? Why did it take an intervention from the Information Commissioner for the reports on these five schools to be released? Surely principals should not have to beg for information to make sure their pupils are safe. In the end they had to rely on a freedom of information request submitted by a journalist, in this case the Dublin Inquirer. In the case of Belmayne Educate Together national school, there were simple solutions in respect of the stores which were present on the stairs. Had the school been told about that it could have cleared those stores. It seems nonsensical that schools would be kept in the dark about these issues rather than being worked with to fix problems as quickly and as effectively as possible. That leads on to the next question. What processes will the Minister put in place to increase transparency and direct communications? He mentioned that he has written to the schools in respect of guidance and protocols on schools' responsibilities, but again there is no point in doing that because we have seen that principals were seeking the information and were not getting it. One can have every fire drill in the world, but if a school will burn down within 60 minutes, a principal is entitled to that information, as is every child and every single person who works in that building. It is despicable. Does the Minister intend to introduce a programme to audit the fire safety of all school buildings in the State? Perhaps that could not be done in one year but it could be done on a phased basis. Will the Minister indicate a timeline for that? It seems there are at least 17 schools which need to be looked at as soon as possible. They are the other 17 which were built by Western Building Systems, apart from the five which we are discussing today. I imagine that some of this work was subcontracted out. Does the Department have a comprehensive list of work undertaken on any school by any company which held a subcontract under Western Building Systems? That would seem to be the very minimum which needs to be done. I imagine it would add up to considerably more than 25 schools. As I said earlier, for practical reasons all schools cannot be audited immediately, but I would ask the Minister to consider that. We need to ensure the safety of all children in every school in Ireland. If the Minister is not willing to do that, will he outline why he believes that the sample which he has sought in his tender will be able to catch any and all fire safety deficiencies in the country? It seems from these five schools that the instance of fire safety deficiencies could be much higher than could be dealt with by auditing just 25 schools. The Minister stated in his reply to a recent parliamentary question that 37 schools were refused fire safety works by his Department since 2015. While the information as to why each one is a mystery and has not been provided, there still appears to be a huge number of refusals, especially when weighed up against the number of approvals. For example, in Donegal over the past three years only two out of seven applications have been approved.I am just looking for information on that. Why are there so many refusals?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister but his responses, but I am not quite sure if the question most of us have asked about the delays has been answered. Why was the principal of the Educate Together school denied access seven times? What was the justification for it? I am not sure if we received an answer to that question. I refer to Western Building Systems. The Minister has said it may apply for future tenders and that one of the grounds on which it could be excluded from the application process would be grave professional misconduct. I presume that is what happened and what we have read about.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses. As a mum of three young kids and as a former teacher who taught at second level for 20 years - four in a private school and 16 in a disadvantaged school - I have seen the differences in facilities offered to children. On the Food Dudes programme, described by Mr. Neary, I saw the change that occurred when I, as a parent, did not choose what went into my children's lunch box. They made the decision and wanted the fruit and the vegetables. I thought it was fantastic and it has been sustained. I love the idea of the golden mile. On the fixed playground in primary schools, which Ms Heneghan raised, the only issue is insurance. Other members have raised that. My questions are really directed to Mr. Ward. As my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan said, great things are happening but it is sporadic. What can we do to make sure it is happening in all our schools for all our children? Even in my own constituency I see one of those issues. A second level school is waiting 37 years for a PE hall. I have asked for an audit of the second level schools but have been told it is not happening. A response from the Department told me that where schools do not have PE halls, they have access to local facilities. They do not. Much of the time they are disadvantaged schools that do not have the money to pay for transport to a local facility. Frankly, I do not think they should have to use up part of their PE time getting on a bus to go to a local facility. If Mr. Ward will pardon the pun, waiting 37 years is not a level playing field. It is not fair on second level pupils. It rains a lot and they do not even have an all-weather pitch. I do not see how that is right at any level when we have an obesity crisis in Ireland. They are being asked to change in a classroom when it rains. It is mixed school. That classroom is their PE hall, with the outline of a goalpost painted on the wall. It is a huge issue which the Department needs to address. I do not understand the refusal to audit second level schools. Mr. Ward mentioned that teachers should be equipped in terms of the requirements of the curriculum and these wonderful initiatives in the junior and leaving certificate cycles. If they do not have the facilities, it is very hard to deliver the programmes properly, fairly and equally to all children. Ms Heneghan talked about the small areas covered with tarmacadam that are seen as the play areas. There is a problem coming down the road and we are not future-proofing our schools. This came up in my constituency and in the neighbouring one. Some 93 of 105 schools in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown are zoned residential. We have seen two schools lose their green spaces. There is no forward planning or future thinking when it comes to population growth. We will need more space for schools and green space, yet we even had the chief executive of Dublin City Council announcing last week that we should build on the green spaces in Dublin city. There is a lack of thinking ahead to protect the future. There is a crisis currently but we must also think ahead to make sure it does not continue. We must protect the green spaces in our schools and cities to keep our children healthy and happy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My questions were not addressed. I ask Mr. Ward to stress to the Department that teachers want to do a good job but cannot do so without a PE hall.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The school I mentioned has been there for 37 years. It came through the Celtic tiger without getting a PE hall. When the State was at its wealthiest and money was spent ridiculously on other things, this school was overlooked. That is why I would like an audit. Have other schools spent 37 years without a PE hall and, if so, why?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Following on from the Chairman's question about vending machines being banned, is the case even more extreme? Some schools do not have vending machines but they have the fizzy drinks for sale behind the counter in their canteens. Should we be looking for fizzy-drink-free zones in schools? One can see the difference in the children's behaviour after taking that sugar rush. Is that something the Department would consider? My other questions are for the officials from the Department of Health. What sort of contact do they have with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Education and Skills, not just about activity in schools but about ensuring that children can walk and cycle safely to school? Activity on the way to school can also help tackle obesity. We always look to Finland when we talk about education. They have a "health in all policies" approach which has helped tackle obesity in childhood in recent years. Some 8% of Finland's education budget goes on delivering school meals. I understand it is provided for in legislation that every child is guaranteed a school meal. Is that something we should be considering? Should we be rolling out comprehensive healthy school meals? We have a crisis in obesity but we also have one in five children going to school hungry. It makes sense that it would help their education if they were eating the right foods and if we make sure they are not hungry in the classroom.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their opening statements. I taught in a DEIS school for 16 years. In my opinion, home school liaison links in well with the Education Welfare Office. The school completion officers are the unsung heroes of any school. The teachers see the benefits in the classroom but a lot is done behind the scenes and in the community around the parents' room. I commend the incredible work being done, as well as the strengthening of families. The demand for participation is indicative of the success of the programmes for families in need. I will open the meeting to members and will then come back to the witnesses for answers.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witness and call Deputy O'Sullivan.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. We will now take answers to those questions.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Does Ms McCafferty wish to add to that?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Do Mr. Shiel and Ms Kelly have anything to add? I think Deputy O'Sullivan was looking for some information from the Department.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Would Mr. Noel Kelly or Ms Maria Tobin like to respond?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	There are 416 home-school community liaison teachers in 530 schools. Can the officials from the Department indicate what is the maximum number? Does it mean home-school liaison teachers share schools? The education welfare officer is integrated into the system but what is the maximum number of schools of which an education welfare officer is in charge? How does it work? Is there an overload and, if there is, what are the plans to address it? I commend the work on a successful transition from primary to second level but if a student breaks a generational cycle in their family, gets to leaving certificate and does well, what happens next? Do we need to look at supports for the transition from second level to third level? Do the witnesses agree that children are slipping through at this stage and, if so, are there any plans to address it? The goal is to get children to benefit from a school education but with our one-size-fits-all curriculum it is hard to captivate a child. Is this something we need to examine? Do we need to look at the apprenticeship scheme in Germany as an option? Is there any language barrier in this area? We have very rich, diversified, international communities in our schools and this is something we must treasure and embrace. Are there enough supports for teachers? One might need to explain to a family that both the parents and children can benefit from this but what supports are provided where there is a language barrier? What do the teachers feel about DEIS inspections? Have they experienced them? Has the Department gathered any data about what might be working well or what supports and resources may be lacking?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would like to say very well done on all the witnesses' achievements at the WorldSkills 2017. We are very fortunate to have such fine ambassadors like the witnesses show-casing their talents and skills on a world stage. I think the witnesses are doing fantastic work promoting apprenticeships and traineeships. I am curious to know whether the witnesses felt they got enough encouragement and support from career guidance counsellors in school in taking up apprenticeships. I would like to ask Ms Leahy what can be done to get more women involved. Perhaps the gentlemen might have something to say as well. Mr O'Toole mentioned the need for social media promotion and I would like to congratulate him on the website apprenticeship.ie and the reach of 100,000 on Facebook. Well done on that. It is great to see the progress that is being made.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As Deputy Byrne said, that is why we have to build on the witnesses' successes here and, as legislators, try to change things to make sure that every school is promoting apprenticeships and traineeships.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the delegates for their statements and submissions. My first question is for the departmental officials.  While I welcome the reform, changes and new developments in respect of physical education, I have questions. This is not the first time I have raised the matter at the committee. There are schools which do not have a PE hall, including one in my constituency which has not had one for 37 years. I do not know, therefore, how the manner in which the rolling out of that subject as part of the leaving certificate programme will be fair and equitable. It is like saying to students taking music as a subject to leaving certificate level that all of the necessary resources will be provided but that when it rains, they will not have access to instruments, that they will not be able to play music and that they will not have music manuscripts. I do not know how that could be considered fair. Every school should have the same facilities and all students should have equal access. It has come to my attention that there are schools in which there are more students who are exempt from taking Irish in the leaving certificate examinations - up to 32 in one classroom - than who are who taking it. What are the guidelines in that regard as it is not fair on either teacher or students? There can be a range of academic abilities in a class comprising 32 students, some of whom may have a requirement for special needs assistance which is not available because assistance is being provided in the classroom in which Irish is being taught. A teacher can be dealing with students ranging from A level to those with special needs to those coping with a language barrier and need assistance. Are there plans to address these issues in the leaving certificate reform programme?  There is a worrying trend with respect to the leaving certificate applied programme. Schools are opting out of offering the programme because it is not considered to be as attractive as the leaving certificate programme and also because it is not considered to attract the right type of student. How does the Department intend to tackle that issue? It must be brought to attention that on the day the leaving certificate examination results are issued students who have completed the leaving certificate applied programme are often overlooked and not interviewed. No spotlight is put on students who have spent two years doing their utmost to do well in aiming to achieve the distinction of passing the leaving certificate applied examinations. Why will the review of the leaving certificate applied programme only include English and communications, mathematical applications and ICT? What about the subjects of music, the arts, languages, leisure and recreation and hotel and catering? Why are not they not included? Is it only the module descriptor that is included? Does that mean that there will still be key assignments to be completed? At the end of sixth year, as the departmental officials and, I am sure, everyone here know, the teachers are told to hold on to the key assignments completed until the end of September. How often have they been inspected? I know of a school in which never once have the key assignments completed by any child been inspected and this provision has been in place since the mid-1990s. With the module descriptor, there is a tendency for the teacher and the child to move to the key assignments and make sure they are completed, sometimes without critical thinking, and tick the appropriate box. One may find a few students have done the exact same work in the key assignments. It is a question of getting over the line. What about the practical achievements which are key elements of the leaving certificate applied programme? Why is that matter not being reviewed by the NCCA? What information is given to students on the leaving certificate applied programme when it comes to choosing it? What information on and encouragement to participate in apprencticeships are given to students? Is it sporadic and does it depend on the career guidance teacher or the school? The statistic which shows that there has been a 2% take-up is frightening.  My final question is for the Department or the parents' council. Those students who have followed the new junior cycle programme have followed a different type of course as part of which they have embraced critical thinking, but to take English as an example, they will now move to learn by rote. What supports are in place for them? It is a leap into a different type of learning process because the reforms will not be implemented in time for them. In 2018 what supports will be in place for them to make the transition?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I refer to the Department addressing the trend of schools opting out of offering the leaving certificate applied. In the reform of the leaving certificate, we cannot continue with a one-size-fits-all approach. We need to serve all our students. The leaving certificate applied needs to be reformed but it can be brilliant. Some students excel in it. It suits them. To avoid a one-size-fits-all approach, has the Department considered making it compulsory that all schools would offer the leaving certificate applied?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It does not clarify the situation. No one is saying that there is not a place for the leaving certificate applied. The problem is that due to league tables, certain schools are not offering it to their students because they feel they can shed them to other schools. It is definitely an epidemic in Dublin. Schools are recommending to students to go to a school down the road which offers the leaving certificate applied because it would suit their needs because they are concentrating on the league tables and how they can excel and have that published in the national newspapers. This not fair on students. With respect, I encourage the Department to consider making it compulsory in order to stop that trend because that is where the stigma lies. As it stands, we are allowing schools to not offer that subject and therefore not serve all students equally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Like my colleagues, I commend the witnesses. They are fine ambassadors for the youth of our country. Our country is in good hands with them coming along. I wish to raise one or two questions. Regarding the well-being of our students, I alert our witnesses to the fact that last September this committee published a report on promoting positive mental health in our schools, which contained some key recommendations. We have forwarded that on to the Minister for his consideration. Comhairle na nÓg's report shows that less than half of students are satisfied with counselling and career guidance services at their schools. Was that due to the reduction in career guidance or the standard of services that was available? Apart from career guidance, is there a need for a completely separate counsellor in schools to deal with students' well-being and mental health? I am curious as to whether the witnesses have noticed any change in teaching techniques in their own experience of schools from, say, first to sixth year. Is there more active learning as inspections are looking for that from teachers? Alternatively, is it a generational thing, whereby the new generation of teachers is very much focused on active learning? Finally, I am interested in the witnesses' thoughts on inspections. At the moment it is just a questionnaire that some years fill out, or that parents of some students fill out. I refer to the management leadership learning inspection, MLL. What are the witnesses' thoughts on what they would like students' contribution to inspections to be?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe atá i láthair inniu as an bpictiúr soiléir atá léirithe acu i dtaobh céard atá i gceist le hoideachas a chur ar fáil ar na scoileanna oileánda. Aontaím le Bríd Ní Dhonncha go bhfuil an scoil i gcroílár gach pobal, go háirithe ar na hoileáin. Muna ndéanfaimid beart de réir briathar san Oireachtas, agus má ligfimid ár maidí le scruth seachas bheith ag díriú ar thábhacht na Gaeltachta agus ar thábhacht na scoileanna seo, beimid uilig ciontach as slad a dhéanamh ar anam agus ar chuisle an náisiúin seo. Céard is féidir a dhéanamh chun múinteoirí óga a mhealladh agus a choimeád ar na hoileáin? An bhfuil maoiniú le haghaidh taistil i gceist? An bhfuil níos mó teagmháil agus taistil idir na hoileáin ag teastáil? An bhfuil deacrachtaí leis an idirbhliain a chur ar fáil sna meánscoileanna? On Mr. Gilmore's dealings with the Department of Education and Skills and the Irish and bilingual grants, what is the Department's reason? I do not understand why these schools are not getting them. Ms McHugh's submission mentions that Gairmscoil Mhic Diarmada on Arranmore does not have a school completion officer. Why is that? Do I presume that they do not have a home school liaison officer either? Those two roles are crucial. Regarding granting independent status to Coláiste Naomh Eoin, I do not know the reason that has not been granted. I refer this to the delegates. I am a teacher myself. It must be nightmarish dealing with it from an administrative point of view. In the day-to-day role as a teacher that is the first thing learned off by heart for the most basic of things. I still know my teaching roll number. It is beyond ridiculous. I do not know how a principal is expected to run a school without that independent status or being able to have reports and exams electronically.I know from my experience as a teacher that the Department of Education and Skills is constantly saying that we must move with the times yet here is a school being prevented from doing so. It is being pulled back all the time. What is the Department's defence for that? 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I follow on from Senator Ruane's question to Ms Quinn on the expansion of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. I have been pursuing the matter and have submitted questions to the Minister, Deputy Zappone. I do not know how we can expand something that is already overstretched. Mr. Noel Kelly appeared before the committee before Christmas. The answers I received from the Minister, Deputy Zappone, indicate that we have 89 education welfare officers. That seems pretty poor compared with the 120 in the Six Counties, as advised by Mr. Noel Kelly. Using the Northern Ireland figure for comparison, we would need 300 to run the service properly. At the moment according to the answer to the parliamentary question I submitted to the Minister, Deputy Zappone, I have been told that we have 45 schools per education welfare officer. It is not possible to deal with referrals; they cannot get to the students quickly enough with a ratio of 45 schools per education welfare officer. He reckons that will be 40 by the end of 2018. How can the system work with that? How does the Department of Children and Youth Affairs intend to address that? Dr. O'Sullivan mentioned that leaving certificate applied students are more likely to be unemployed than those who leave school early. Surely that means there is something wrong with the leaving certificate applied. It is not rocket science, but the lack of a review since its introduction in 1995 may be part of the problem. Perhaps the Department should learn from that; no programme should be in place for more than 20 years without being reviewed. I taught in a DEIS school and I taught leaving certificate applied for nearly 20 years. I was never surveyed on the course as to whether I was getting adequate resources and whether I felt students were benefitting enough. However, I learned that the same teachers get assigned for 20 years. I loved teaching leaving certificate applied. If a teacher had good classroom-management skills and was seen as innovative that was the person who was assigned - and assigned for life - to leaving certificate applied. That is also something that needs to be examined. There are weaknesses in the module descriptors for leaving certificate applied. It is a case of ticking the box at the end, getting the key assignment done and handing it in. Teachers are told at the September following the student's graduation that there is a possibility that those key assignment might be checked and told to hold on to them until the end of September. How often are they checked? If they are not being checked they may not be done well or extra help might have been given to those key assignments. There are tasks in leaving certificate applied, such as the personal reflection and practical achievement tasks. Sometimes I wonder if teachers are helping students too much, because those are the tasks that are being checked. When they are coming in, the teachers know that that is the one. A teacher wants to help the child as much as possible, but the child is not learning if the teacher is practically doing the task for them. Teachers talk about this frequently. Why are the teachers not being surveyed on this to ensure it is being done properly? Dr. O'Sullivan made a recommendation on the transition year programme. Why has that programme not been reviewed? One finds that it is the same teachers who teach transition year. Has the Department considered making it compulsory for DEIS schools? I believe it should be compulsory for all schools. There is an amazing difference in the maturity level of a child who has gone through transition year. In that break they get to experiment with so many subjects and get a flavour of everything. That difference can be seen in a child who has gone through transition year. Ms McGovern spoke about the reform of the school completion programme. Some school completion officers have told me of their fear that there will be a move to a regional school completion officer. I do not know how that would work. The school completion officer and the home-school liaison work as a team. They have established trust with the families. They know the families and the families know them. To move to a regional officer would be catastrophic for that programme. It is central to the development of vulnerable children in DEIS schools. Can Ms McGovern shed light on that? There are concerns, which I believe are justified, but it may not be the intention; I hope it is not.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did not get answers to my questions. I have to leave now but I would like if my questions could be answered and I will follow up on the answers later. My questions were on the number of educational welfare officers, the reform of the school completion programme, the appointment of a regional officer, the leaving certificate applied, the lessons to be learned in that regard, if there should be a timeframe for programmes such that they are not allowed to continue for, say, 20 years, without review, and on the Foróige suggestion that transition year be compulsory.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I was a post-primary teacher for 20 years and am a former member of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI. In my experience as a teacher I have worked side by side in the classroom with teachers who received unequal pay for the work they did. That was not right. It will remain an uphill battle for Government to recruit or retain teachers when that fundamental injustice is being done to young teachers. The entire teaching profession has been devalued in recent years. Where we were once a nation proud of our education system, we are now educating children to force them to emigrate. Why would they want to teach in those conditions? Why would anyone want to teach side by side with someone like me who has been there for 20 years and get treated differently? New teachers come in full of new ideas, new initiatives and energy, and willing to do all of the extracurricular activities and more because they are new. What is happening in our education system is appalling. What are the witnesses' opinions on the Minister's brainwave to incentivise certain subjects, as reported in The Irish Times in early January of this year? That is further inequality within teaching when we are trying to address shortages of teachers due to inequality. What are the professional opinions of the witnesses on that? On the subject of retired teachers coming back into the classroom, are they Garda vetted? As a member of the Teaching Council, I was asked three years ago to get Garda vetted because I was not initially when I qualified. I had no problem doing that. It is what is done. Are the retired teachers Garda vetted? What safety is there for our children? In respect of the post-primary oral exams, do we know if principals have been forced to say "no" to teachers looking for experience as an oral examiner? It helps a teacher to be an oral examiner. I would say it is crucial and every teacher should do it once to help their students prepare for the junior or leaving certificate. Have principals agreed to release teachers and are they just dreading that oral exam fortnight? Have students been surveyed on the impact of teacher shortages on them? In regard to the whole-school evaluation in management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, perhaps we should be suggesting to the inspectors it is time they added to those questionnaires that go out to parents and students as well as the three-day intensive inspection of teaching practices. What impact do teacher shortages and the lack of supply have on the education of students and what impact is it having on schools? Maybe that is a question that should be on the whole-school evaluation if we are going to be talking about quality education.If we gave feedback to the Minister it might make him act on it. Should a different salary scale apply in Dublin and possibly other cities? I know many recently qualified teachers in both primary and secondary schools. They have completed their first year and have got a permanent job in year two. They are saying, "That's it. I'm out of here because I have no quality of life. I'll have to leave my permanent job." The decision is whether to leave the country or to go to a different part of the country, but they have to throw away a permanent job. Should something be done there? I would be interested to hear the witnesses' different opinions on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mr. Ó Ruairc mentioned in his presentation that 100,000 are on the register. How many of those 100,000 are teaching in schools today? For those who have left and wish to come back, I know the one dread in a teacher's life is if he or she has missed the deadline to renew his or her registration. It is quite laborious. Thankfully, it never happened to me but I saw what teachers had to fill out, the transcripts, etc. Would there be any sort of leeway, if a teacher was on sick leave or wanted to come back having emigrated, to make it easier so that the teacher would not have to face the incredible amount of documentation that has to be gathered if he or she is considering returning to the teaching profession in Ireland? I forgot to ask Mr. Paul Byrne a question on job sharing. Teachers feel frustration about it and it might be a disincentive to staying.When teachers apply for job-sharing and it is granted by the school, often it is so that they can spend time with their children or some other personal reason. They might say that they need perhaps three afternoons off so that they can pick up their child after work. School A has no problem with allowing for it in the timetable but school B will say that the teacher is on every afternoon for the year. The principal says the timetable threw it up and that it was outside his or her control. Is there a standardised system that could be given to principals and deputy principals? I know some teachers who are considering leaving the profession or taking early retirement because their request was not granted and they perceive an injustice as other schools seem to be able to handle it no problem. Gabhaim míle buíochas as an gcur i láthair faoin nGaeilge inniu. Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, tá fonn ar an Aire tosaíocht a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí STEM. Cén tionchar a bheadh ar a leithéid de ghníomh ar na Gaelscoileanna?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I reply to some of the comments made by Mr. Byrne?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would like to make two short points. Mr. Mulconry summed up the strategy brilliantly. Principals are overstretched and under-resourced. We regularly hear young teachers saying they will never become principals. When they walk into the principal's office, they cannot see him or her because of all the paperwork. Mr. Byrne mentioned that many teachers are saying "No" to oral examinations. Much of the training for examiners happens in late January or early February. Has a problem presented itself this year? Will there be a crisis for those examinations this year? I am curious about the guarantee that every single substitute teacher has been vetted. I do not know how that can be guaranteed. Is there a procedure or a process whereby a principal does not allow a retired teacher back in?I am not saying all of this to tackle the schools. I am just saying this could be a way to get around the Minister and encourage him to say there is an issue. In no way am I saying anything to tackle the schools on this issue. Is that what it will take, if the Minister feels there is not a guarantee on vetting? I want to clarify that that is the angle I am coming from. It is obvious that the issues of people working in an unequal system and equal pay for equal work are not a priority for the Minister. Do we have to approach the matter from a different angle? That is the only reason I raised the issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I fully understand that a principal would say "no" due to a shortage of teachers, and more principals are doing so. Are there enough examiners for the oral and practical examinations this year? Has that information been ascertained yet? A lot of the training of examiners takes place around now, and therefore principals should know how many people have volunteered to train as an examiner.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No. I agree wholeheartedly with the statement made by Mr. Mulconry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the delegates for the submissions. I have a number of questions. At senior cycle, is the requirement to do RSE applicable to students doing the applied leaving certificate programme? I read the Department's submission to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.The submission stated that RSE, at senior cycle, is still based on an interim curriculum from 2011. Is a seven-year interim curriculum the norm? To me, a seven-year interim curriculum seems quite lengthy. RSE is one of five strands that make up the SPHE curriculum. Why is RSE the only one to be delivered? Does the Department intend to deliver the other four strands? I respectfully suggest that the gender studies strand needs to be updated and I ask that it be updated as part of the review. The gender studies strand only refers to male and female experiences. Everything is described in the language of both genders rather than referring to the spectrum of gender identity. My next group of questions is for the NCCA. The Stay Safe programme is centred around children learning to say, "No", get away and tell. Does the NCCA believe enough has been done to deal with the issue of consent? Are children being taught to be cognisant not only of their own comfort and boundaries but those of others? Finally, when were the RSE resources last updated?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The witness stated that the ethos may have an impact on how students hear what is being presented. Surely what students hear being presented is that which is said. The ethos, therefore, would have a major impact on what is being presented.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I asked earlier about students doing the leaving certificate applied. Is it a requirement that they study RSE? With regard to the interim curriculum, how long can a curriculum be interim? It appears to be seven or eight years here. Is that the norm with any other subject? Regarding the gender studies strand, does the NCCA intend to review the language? The language only refers to both genders. When were the RSE resource materials last updated?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the question of going into schools, are there inspections of RSE at present? Are such inspections included in the so-called "drive-bys" or are there official inspections? Is there anything about students' experience of RSE or parents' knowledge of the RSE curriculum in the management, leadership and learning, MLL, surveys of parents and students? I would have thought it would be essential to gather such information during detailed MLL inspections.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that at senior level?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It seems to me that merely asking whether a parent is aware of the school's RSE policy is not sufficiently probing of the parent's level of satisfaction with the RSE programme. Perhaps this is something that needs to be reviewed. Maybe parents should be asked if they are content with the school's RSE policy and if it has been explained in detail to them. To ask simply whether they are aware of it seems very general.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I also asked how long a curriculum under the leaving certificate applied programme can be allowed to stay in place as an interim programme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	How long is an interim curriculum allowed to stay in place? Surely the word "interim" indicates that it is temporary by its very nature.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am asking about what was submitted in 2011.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This interim curriculum has been in place since 2011.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is mislabelled.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Who determines what is age-appropriate material? How do we make sure it is not given too late because we are so fearful of doing it too early? Mr. Browne mentioned that teachers in schools with a high implementation rate were trained in facilitating openness and confidentiality among students. Does that mean that happens in only some schools? How sporadic is the teacher training? Surely all teachers should be trained in the same way. We have been told that RSE must be taught at senior level but in her statement Ms Burke said that her school had no RSE in two years. I do not understand that if it is compulsory at senior level.  Can the three unions tell me if there has been a survey of RSE teachers or does dissatisfaction with the training ever come up at TUI and ASTI conventions or branch meetings? I hear many references to the partnership needed and fully agree because everything in education involves a partnership between parents and teachers but how is that presented in reality? What exactly is happening or is it just something that is beautifully written into the RSE policy in schools but is not actually happening?  Perhaps Ms Leydon, Mr. Duffy or Ms Lewis could tell me how teachers are selected at second level. Is it a timetable issue such that whichever teacher is available at a given time, be they the music or maths teacher, teaches it or is it typically the religious education, RE, teacher who becomes the RSE teacher? Is there really good training for these teachers or are they thrown in at the deep end? That would not be fair to teacher or student. Does the Department support the teachers, given that so many new subjects and so many changes have been introduced? 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentations. I have questions for each and every one of them. What do they consider to be, or how do we define, age-appropriate materials? How do we ensure that they are not delivered too late or too early? What exactly is their advice on this and how it should be done? Ms Byrnes spoke of the use of facilitators in delivering sexual health education. How does she envision this happening at a national level? Would she advocate for facilitators to be employed by the Department or contracted? How do we ensure a level playing field and that all schools get the same type of programmes? Would it be a weekly programme or module? I presume, given what Ms Lennon said, that if outside facilitators are employed, they would then have to have training on how to engage young people with disabilities and on easy-to-read materials and methodologies. Ms Byrnes also mentioned the feedback survey on her module, which is fantastic. It is the way to do it. Are we getting a sense of what is children's sense of this? Are we tapping in enough, or does she think we should conduct some kind of national survey of our youth on their attitudes towards or understanding of sex, consent and relationships and then design programmes? Does she think enough studies have been done? Regarding the Growing Up LGBT and anti-bullying programme to be included in the whole-school inspections, does Ms Griffith feel this is not being taught across the board in all schools? How does she envisage this working? It is subject-orientated when the inspectors come in, so would that be a module instead of SPHE or sex education? How exactly would that work in the whole-school evaluations? Should it be included not just in whole-school inspections? Is it ever included in the incidental inspections? We used to call them drive-bys. Perhaps that is a good way of checking up as well. I was not quite clear on the anti-bullying programme being included in the whole-school inspections. Is that the Stand Up awareness week or is it the anti-bullying policy? Do the witnesses believe that the ethos of the school interferes with the provision of fact-based and informative sex education?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Incidental inspections could be considered in this context as the whole-school evaluation is every few years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, I had to chair a meeting. I thank the Chairman for explaining that to our guests. I read the written submissions in advance of the meeting and managed to catch the end of Ms McGowan's presentation. What I found quite striking was the fact that SPHE is the only post-primary subject for which there is no professional, accredited qualification. That is quite shocking and it certainly explains why teachers would feel uncomfortable. It seems unfair to both students and teachers alike and it also goes some way to explaining the difficulties around RSE timetabling. It has become a difficulty for principals, in truth. They are faced with trying to squash it in and selecting a poor, unfortunate teacher to teach it. That is the way it is treated in schools, which is shocking given its importance for our children.It is appalling. On the issue of ethos, I do not know how to reconcile the delivery of relationships and sexuality education in line with the ethos of the school with a circular being issued to schools instructing them to ensure RSE is objective and does not withhold or censor. There is a little confusion for school management. My question for Dr. Debbie Ging relates to the research that has been done. She said the Department of Education and Skills and HSE have commissioned the survey. Is the survey related purely to the experience of the teachers, parents and students with how RSE is taught in schools or has it been widened to ascertain young people's thoughts, experiences, knowledge and what they feel is needed with regard to relationships, sexuality and consent? A question for all the witnesses relates to age appropriate material. How do we determine what is age appropriate so that we get the age right and do not deliver RSE too early or late? How is that ascertained or determined? Do some schools have an RSE policy in place while others do not? How does that work? Why do some schools have a policy while others do not? After a whole-school evaluation of management, leadership and learning, or MLL as it is known, has been completed, do inspectors comment on the merits of the school's RSE policy or ask why it does not have an RSE policy in place? Has the Department highlighted this in any way? Do we know what the position is regarding feedback from inspections? It seems bizarre not to have a policy on RSE.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the study focus solely on the delivery of RSE without ascertaining the experience or knowledge of relationships or sexuality among young people?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank both witnesses for attending. I am stunned following the contributions of the two Senators. There are no words to describe the lack of appropriate communication. That shows a lack of empathy. As has been said, the State has failed but, worse still and to our shame, as a State, we continue to fail. I commend the witnesses who are so brave in their advocacy for the women. The Minister published the Caranua eligibility review on 29 May. The statement said the Department would like to get the views of survivors on how that consultation process should proceed and that to give their views a short survey form could be accessed at www.surveymonkey.com. Was anyone consulted on the proposal to put the survey up on the Department's website? There is something gravely insulting about the next steps of an issue of that magnitude being reduced to a survey on the Department's website. Was there any consultation or was it news to the witnesses on the day? Regarding the eligibility review, how can Caranua properly assist the interdepartmental committee process considering its imminent closure? Based on everything the witnesses have told us, Caranua does not have the information because it has not engaged with survivors. How can it assist? I just do not understand that because does not make sense to me. It states on page 22 of the eligibility review:One of the options for the next steps is for Caranua to continue with its current approach in managing the fund within the €15,000 cap, having regard to survivors' needs. Caranua already seeks to manage the fund as fairly as possible and to respond to the needs of survivors.How does a €15,000 cap have regard to survivors' needs because surely the needs vary on a person-by-person basis? Is there not a conflict within that option? Surely the assistance must be tailored. There are so many contradictions that it is appalling.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is no way that option can have regard to survivors' needs once the cap is in place.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank everyone for their presentations and for sharing their experience and knowledge of this area. The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which just passed through the Dáil and is now before the Seanad, gives the Minister the power to compel the school to open a special class in a school through a process that is begun by the NCSE. That is slightly different from the calls that we heard when we were dealing with the Bill at committee, namely that the NCSE should have the power to compel. Do the witnesses have an opinion on the Minister's amendment? Does it adequately provide for this? The amendment also refers to insufficient capacity in an area. I never understood how that would be defined. Would it be one pupil or two, or ten? Does the amendment still give a school an opportunity to say "No"? How is that defined?  I have often raised management, leadership and learning, MLL, evaluations at this committee. Schools undergo two and a half days of MLL evaluation and then the inspectorate reports back to the staff on the Friday, for example. I am aware of a school which has many children with special education needs and that celebrates diversity in a good way, that the inspector asked the staff, almost as a criticism, if they had ever asked themselves why they have so many children with special educational needs. Apart from being a shameful comment, has it come to the witnesses' attention that these questions are being asked in schools that embrace diversity and are doing their best for children with special education needs? More important, is the question being asked of the school down the road, for example, as to why they do not have children with special educational needs? This might be something that we can push here but is this something of which the witnesses are aware? Can they link in with the inspectorate and ensure that if one question is asked of one school that the other question is asked of the other school? We all know of the schools that cherry-pick and that do not provide for children with special education needs. Has any assessment been done of these schools? Do they also not provide for leaving certificate applied, LCA? Do they follow the league tables rather than the needs of children in their community? Is there a correlation between schools that do not provide the LCA and does not have many, if any, children with special educational needs and schools that provide the LCA and has many children with special educational needs? Is this something that the Department should look at? How can it be addressed?I am curious about whole-school training. Has Ms Corr thought about what it would look like?  Mr. Harris said that teachers have been trained to deal with children and the different types of special educational needs that might present in the classroom and that they do a good job but classmates do not have an understanding. He referred to the attitude and judgment but it may arise because they have not been educated on it. I was delighted to read that AsIAm is providing workshops to students at second level in many schools. It is something that should be rolled out nationwide so it is not sporadic. Has thought been given to that? Is it something the Department might consider in order that every child is educated and that we can truly celebrate diversity because we understand how to celebrate it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the issue of the closing of the school, I was curious as to how Ms Corr envisages training taking place. Can it be done over two days, when the school is closed, or can the Department issue a directive to schools that it should be done on the two days before school commences again after the holidays? That could apply to every single person working in a school community.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am thinking of post-primary because that is the area I have experience in. Teachers have to work 167 days, and if they work certain days it can impact on their holidays. Training could be carried out during the year. Schools could allocate two days in October or November. I presume that training would apply not just to teachers and SNAs but also to caretakers and office staff.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Chairman. I apologise for my absence but I had to attend another meeting. I read the submission in advance and I hope that I do not repeat anything that was said earlier. Pay inequality is at the heart of these issues. We will not retain teachers or attract people to the profession as long as the injustice exists. It is simply not right to have two colleagues teaching side by side and classroom by classroom but insist that they are not paid the same because one joined the teaching profession in a certain year. References are continually made to young teachers starting on a salary of around €36,000 or €35,959 and rising. One cannot survive on that salary if one lives in Dublin city because one simply will be unable to afford to rent a home. Let us not forget that a young teacher who starts working at the age of 25 or 26 will be in his or her 50s before they reach the top of the salary scale. That is a lengthy climb to reach the top of the salary scale and is a matter that needs to be addressed. My next question is on secondary level education. Are students and their parents surveyed during a management, leadership and learning, MLL, evaluation? Is one of the questions on whether teachers are available to teach certain subjects? Is there a lack of teachers in certain subjects? Has that situation had an affect on teachers and the education of children? Has research into the subject been undertaken? Have students in primary and secondary schools been surveyed about the impact on them due to a lack of teachers? Yesterday it was announced in media reports that suicide intervention training will be provided in schools. We need to provide proper mental health supports to teachers as teachers are overworked and under-resourced. Although training in suicide prevention is crucial, it seems to be a new addition to the long list of duties for teachers. Yesterday it was also announced that the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, will deliver training on how teachers can respond to an unexpected critical incident. On 27 June, officials from NEPS appeared before the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care. They informed members that there is one psychologist for every 25 schools and that the service is very under-resourced and understaffed. In fact, the situation is so bad that if a psychologist who works for NEPS avails of maternity leave, there is no-one to replace her. It is incredible that NEPS has been asked to train teachers who are overworked and under-resourced in suicide prevention.We are finding out from our mental health committee that we need proper counsellors in our schools and that we must not add to teachers' workload. Suicide prevention is a huge responsibility to give to any teacher. There are far-reaching consequences. The mental health supports should be in place and they are crucial in our schools, but I do not know that burdening our teachers is the way to provide them. Then there is the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which provides the training. There are under 200 NEPS schools in Ireland. How many schools do we have in total? It is nearly 4,000. Despite this, we are saying NEPS will train more teachers. This needs to be looked at. We are trying to incentivise college graduates to take certain subjects. There is no denying the shortage of teachers in certain subjects, but it will remain an uphill battle for Government to attract students into the teaching profession, or even to hold on to them, since so many do not receive equal pay for equal work. It is this inequality which is leading to our teachers leaving our shores. There is no campaign that will bring them back home when they know that their quality of life will be less in their home country, and that is a very sad fact. We need to address this fundamental injustice. They are struggling to attain that quality of life, especially in our cities, with current market rental values. Our teachers have been devalued over successive years. They are highly skilled, specialised practitioners with far-reaching responsibilities. Apart from the job of educating our children, they act in loco parentis. To be effective, any measure to recruit and retain our teachers must address this fundamental injustice and we must ensure equal pay for equal work.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is putting more pressure-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----on teachers, who are so under-resourced and who are screaming for proper help for their students who are suffering from mental health difficulties. We are saying to those teachers that they have to take it on. I do not know that that is the right approach to take with teachers who are already so overburdened and under-resourced. Perhaps it is something the mental health committee needs to raise. I know the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, are to come before the committee, and the Chairman is a member of the committee, as I am. Perhaps we could raise the matter tomorrow because I am not sure that that is the right way. It is certainly not what we recommended in the report the committee did. We looked at different resources but not a burdening of the teacher. I do not know if the Chairman agrees with that, but-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have one question I forgot to ask. Apart from subbing, what is the extent of the problem in special schools? It is not even a matter of substitute teachers but rather getting teachers in for full-year contracts. Is there a crisis in this regard in special schools?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The witnesses are not aware of any problem finding teachers for year-long contracts in special schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentations. In the first instance, I want to address Ms Ryan of Our Lady's Grove Concerned Parents Group. I am most familiar with this school as it is in my constituency. I find the situation quite bizarre, as do the parents. I was at the meeting with the Minister and his officials when we were told there simply was not enough demand for school places to justify the expansion of that school or the protection of the land. However, a year later, funding for 42 schools was announced, two of which were in the Goatstown-Stillorgan area, the very area for which we were told there was no demand in the previous year. I simply do not understand that. How does that happen? How can parents be told that there is no demand in one year but yet, a year later, there is enough demand to warrant a new primary and secondary school in the area? If there was no mistake and there really was a bizarre change in the demographics of the area, what does that indicate about the Department's mechanism for deciding on the provision of new schools? In its submission the Department says it only has a four-year window to plan for primary schools. There must be a more long-term approach to planning taken by county councils and their planning departments, the Department for Housing, Planning and Local Government and other Government entities. What is the Department doing to protect school lands across the country? With the greatest of respect, as a former councillor I am well aware that zoning is a reserved function. What communication takes place during the development plan process between the Department and the council? Councillors should be given an indication from the Department. In my constituency, 25 of the 33 schools were zoned for residential use. Was this flagged by the Department during the development plan process? There has been a rapid growth in population here, as well as an increase in births. If that communication is not taking place, should it happen? There should be greater communication and co-operation between councils and the Department of Education and Skills during that planning process, ensuring that councillors are well informed enough to make decisions on the zoning of lands during the development process, rather than having to go through the complicated process of re-opening it. Are there plans for that type of communication to take place?  A large amount of land will be sold off. We know that because religious orders are looking to sell off land to fund projects such as nursing homes for the religious, as in the case of Our Lady's Grove national school. This is not specific to Goatstown; it will happen across the country. Greater co-operation is required in that area. It was stated earlier that most school sites are not owned by the Minister for Education and Skills and that decisions relating to the future of the lands rest with the owners. Has the Department looked into the possibility of bringing forward legislation to retain open green spaces or has it examined the possibility of compulsory purchase orders to retain such lands? Has it thought about purchasing additional lands for existing schools as required?  Does the Department have comprehensive aggregable data on the physical infrastructure of school buildings in the State? This would include information about the size of the buildings, the condition they are in, a list of available facilities and information on access to recreation and sporting facilities etc. The ASTI submission, mentioned by others today, led me to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General from 1996, which referenced the fact that a number of tasks were recommended by a 1988 report drawn up by an interdepartmental committee of officials.One of these was that an inventory of school accommodation detailing the location, size and condition of all school buildings should be prepared as a matter of urgency. I wonder whether this urgent inventory has ever been done because the indications from witnesses are that it has not been done. Why is that? That leads to a question I have brought up many times in the committee. If we consider one resource facility, namely, physical education halls, there is a complete refusal to audit schools to identify those that do not have PE halls, yet we are rolling out physical education as a leaving certificate subject. That inevitably leads to an inequality. When a whole-school evaluation or one of the new management, leadership and learning evaluations, MLLs, is carried out in a school and the report indicates that the lack of a PE hall is having an impact on students, is that a matter for the forward planning section or is the issue parked somewhere in a report? Is the fact that the school needs a PE hall flagged? Twice now, a whole-school evaluation and MLL have indicated there is no PE hall and this is having an impact. This was before it was announced that physical education was to become a leaving certificate subject. If it is the case that an inventory of school accommodation has not been done, what are the Department's plans in this regard? I assume an inventory must have been done at some stage for State schools, if not all schools. Is there a template for the information to be provided by schools on their physical infrastructure? If so, is it possible to provide us with the template and outline the information the Department has on the location, size and condition of school buildings?  I notice the Department's submission refers to the way it tracks enrolments but does not seem to mention any other way of tracking capacity. I am aware of a school in my constituency that was built 40 years ago with a capacity of 1,000 students. It has had 450 students or thereabouts for the past 15 years. Is that information being recorded or is only enrolment at the school being recorded? The school has space available. What is being done to support or invest in the school and bring it and other underutilised schools up to capacity? If the Department does not have information on schools' physical capacity, how can it properly tackle underutilisation and ensure the school to which I refer and others like it receive investment to respond to the changing educational needs outlined by Ms Leydon? Are we over-providing in the identified new school provision? Is that the best use of public money when there are schools like the one in my constituency, which was built for 1,000 students and has had a maximum of 450 students for the past ten years? That would not seem to be the case in Goatstown and with Our Lady's Grove primary school. We just move on, announce a new school and forget about available space, which in this case would be ideal for our children and for planning ahead. What is the policy for bringing existing stock up to the standards of the new schools, where possible? Is there a target policy in place to work with data on the condition of current school infrastructure to prioritise certain improvements across the school building stock in a co-ordinated and effective way? Does the Department have data on which schools are below the standards of new schools? What is its policy on bringing these existing schools up to standard? Is there a priority list, either based on the schools in the worst shape or those lacking key facilities? What is the Department's policy on ensuring schools have access to open recreational space, identified as the ideal in the new school specification?  The witness from the INTO mentioned appropriate supports from the Department for teaching principals of schools that are being extended. Will she expand upon these supports? What is the Department doing to improve its communication on school projects? Principals find this issue problematic, and I have also found it problematic when trying to help them with it. Moreover, has the Department thought about outsourcing to some sort of manager so as to take pressure off principals? 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appreciate that was done in the first quarter of 2018. The committee was told at a meeting in 2017 that there was no need for that school facility because demographics did not match. How old was the data that was quoted to the committee in 2017? Mr. Loftus mentioned the audit of national sports facilities within two years. Can he understand my frustration, and that of many others, at the lack of joined-up thinking where a subject like PE is announced and yet we do not know how many schools do not have a PE hall? There is an inequality there. Mr. Loftus said that facilities will be accessible to the students in a school even if there is not a PE hall in the school. That is not fair on the students either. There is an 80-minute time slot for PE. In one school, the students are getting the full use of those 80 minutes where students in other schools must travel to access facilities so they are not getting the same value. I asked a question and I am not sure it was answered. The inventory of school accommodation detailing the location, size and condition of all school buildings should be prepared as a matter of urgency. Has that been done?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A pilot has been done in Kildare and many other schools have come back to the Department. As it stands, however, we do not have a comprehensive inventory of school accommodation detailing location and facilities.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When enrolment returns show schools under capacity, perhaps owing to a lack of investment and not having key facilities such as a PE hall so that they are not attractive to parents, and when we have a crisis with childhood obesity and mental health issues, I still do not understand how-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. Reading them reminds us that while we have moved forward in terms of the promotion of mental well-being for students in schools, teachers are being left behind. That is even more the case for principal teachers. The results of the survey are startling and reveal disturbing levels of stress. That is not surprising and we must do something about it. Page 9 of the submission states that the system of one release day per week is in operation in Northern Ireland for more than ten years. How does the model work there? What is the resistance from the Department of Education and Skills here? Has the Department liaised with the Department in Northern Ireland to see how such a system could work? From the point of view of the pupils, how will consistency of cover be achieved for the one day a week? Is the shortage of substitute teachers and other teachers related to the issue of equal pay for equal work? Will it not be possible to achieve consistency of cover, given that teaching is seen as a less attractive option for a profession? I speak as a former teacher and I have seen the inequality in the school where I worked for 20 years. How can consistency of cover be addressed? What happens currently if a management issue arises when a principal teacher is in a classroom and he or she has to step out? How is the situation controlled? If a principal must step out, he or she will be concerned about the 30 children who have been left behind? Is someone on standby? Do health and safety issues arise?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose Deputy Thomas Byrne.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations today. I am somewhat distracted by the passion of my colleague, Senator Ruane, and the stories she and her friends have lived through. We read about it in the paper but I know my colleague sees it every day. It has got to me, to be frank, but that is what needs to be heard in committees such as this. I commend Senator Ruane because she brings her passion and personal experiences to the table every time.The Minister issued a circular last year on principles of cost-effective practices that referred to some of the issues Senator Ruane has brought up. It stated that all elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores and only iron-on or sew-on crests should be used. There are references to the phasing out of workbooks between the time the circular was issued and September 2018. It is now September 2018. I am sure the witnesses are aware of the circular. I wonder is there data on how many schools have adhered to this? The third point in this circular referred to the rewarding of schools for adopting these principles. I wonder which schools have been rewarded and why schools would have to be rewarded for phasing out workbooks, phasing out crests and having sew-on crests and for allowing parents to buy uniforms in any store. I question why the Minister indicated in this circular that schools should be rewarded for that when we are talking about a free education system. Is there any data on this? Has the Department followed up on this circular? Has anything been done or was a circular sent out to all schools and just left there? The TUI stated in its submission that the restoration of the capitation grant to 2010 levels would cost €18.5 million. The State currently funds 60 fee-paying schools to the tune of €115 million. I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on that disparity and how resources should be prioritised in light of that. What are the main obstacles in rolling out an effective book rental scheme nationwide and how can they be overcome? What studies have been done on this? This week many households are under incredible stress from sending their children to school. We need to deliver a real free education system instead of having a so-called free education system. One thing that did not come up in the submissions, unless I missed it, is children in direct provision. Their parents receive €20 per week. Surely those families should be getting extra supports or grants. Is there anything like that available for them? What about homeless children? One in three of the homeless people in the country is a child. We know that 42% of homeless people are women, most of the time lone parents and often women who have left domestic abuse. Are there extra supports for homeless children who are going to school and their parents? A 2013 ESRI study outlined how voluntary secondary schools are more reliant than other schools on sources of income such as voluntary contributions and the fundraising Dr. Redmond outlined. The study recommended that the future funding of second level schools needs to be taken into account. Has the Government made any changes to the funding since that 2013 report? Dr. Redmond referred to a parliamentary question in 2017 when the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, said he agreed that the priority issue is the removal of the basic salary payment of €563 per teacher. That was an answer to a parliamentary question on 23 November 2017. Has there been any progress made since then?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is important that the delegates are present because as we approached the start of the new school term in September, many of us were receiving telephone calls from distraught parents who did not know how their children would get to school such was the level of uncertainty. As the delegates said, I appreciate that the delivery of the school transport service can be highly complex, but it is also very frustrating for parents. In his presentation Mr. Kent referred to the call line, but when I received telephone calls from parents in August, my office contacted the call centre and the average waiting time on hold on the line was 20 minutes. Sometimes one was was left on hold for 30 or 35 minutes. When we eventually got through, we were told by the operator that we needed to be put through to the central office, to which they had no direct line; rather, we had to hang up and they got back to us when they had got through to the central office. I do not believe that is the way it should operate. Two days later, having been called back, we managed to get a telephone number for head office. We rang it 15 times over two days, but the number rang out every time without going to voicemail. One can imagine the frustration experienced by a parent. I am present as a representative, not as a parent with only days to go before his or her child goes to school. Something needs to change before next year. I shall give as examples two schools in my area to demonstrate the frustration felt by parents. Mr. Richard Dolan has been exceptionally helpful in getting one of the issues deservedly over the line, for which I thank him. Finally there was someone in the Department to whom we could talk. One could not make it up. One case turned into a two-year saga. There was a Gaelscoil that had every right to a bus service. Two years ago I met the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, and departmental officials to discuss the matter, but a different Gaelscoil in the area which had not applied for a bus service received one. We started from square one again earlier this year and were told that the school would definitely receive a bus service. Come August, however, there was no bus service. We found out that Bus Éireann had a bus, but it appeared that the school had been confused with the other Gaelscoil. I had parents crying on the telephone to me because for two years the two Gaelscoileanna had been confused. It was a strange scenario. A parent who had been crying on the telephone had a next door neighbour who had said to her "Guess what? We got a bus for which we had not even asked. It is amazing." Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. The same mistake was made twice within two years. Something needs to be done. The second case involves the Ballinteer Educate Together school which is temporarily co-located with a second level school in Dundrum. It moved last year to a different campus in Churchtown and meets the distance criteria and so on. There is a need for greater communication between Departments when schools move as they await planning permission for a permanent home. They should automatically receive a school bus service if they move to an area more than 4 km away. The school applied, backed up with a spreadsheet listing some 100 physical applications and containing information on all of the applicants and the distances involved to support its claim. The Department confirmed receipt of the application and confirmed that it had relayed it and the supporting spreadsheet to Bus Éireann. The school then received notification that its application had been deemed to be unsuccessful. The letter stated: "Bus Éireann has confirmed that a total of 19 children are eligible for school transport, but of the 19 eligible children, only eight have actually applied for school transport". The school has still not been able to get to the bottom of the matter and has no idea what happened. Because of data protection regulations there is no way to find out who applied. There is utter confusion.  The school applied again for a bus service in the 2018-19 school year and encouraged parents to apply again through the online application service. More than ten were told on the site that they had been deemed to be eligible to apply. However, they all received rejection notices. One parent appealed the decision and was awarded the remote travel grant. Parents have reached the stage where they are so frustrated that they do not even feel like appealing the decisions made. How can we have trust that Bus Éireann will have the resources in place to deal properly with the allocation of school transport services for all? More importantly, how can we justify having a system in place that seems to just chip away at everybody who engages with it, to the point where parents just give up and the Department does not have to deal with them anymore? That has been the way in cases with which I have dealt in my constituency in the past few years.  In the case of the Gaelscoil, had it not been for the persistence of five mothers who just would not give up, who were in tears on the telephone in describing their personal circumstances and indicating why they needed a service, they got their applications over the line. In the case of the other school, however, the parents are beyond exhausted. They have other circumstances with which to deal in having to move to a temporary location and do not know if there will ever be a permanent school building. Given the mess that has been made in dealing with applications, how can the Department restore faith in the system?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appreciate Mr. Kent saying he has regrets in respect of the call centre and that he will try to do better next year but what is being put in place to make sure it is better? If Bus Éireann took on 15 extra people and it was 1,200 calls a day or an extra 35,000 calls, is there an official review stating the demand in August 2018 and that 100 extra people will be needed next year? Who makes that call? When will the decision be made? I presume it is in the coming months.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My question on Ballinteer Educate Together national school was not answered. There were 100 applications submitted but no one knows what happened to them. The follow on is that for 2018-19, people applied online and they were all deemed to be eligible but every single one of them received a rejection notice. The parents do not know what is going on. They believe theirs is a hopeless cause but I do not think they should give up because something went wrong with the process. How can more than ten people apply online and be deemed eligible only to then receive a rejection notice?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay. Thank you.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the creation of the Technological University Dublin, TU4Dublin. It is heartening to read in the international advisory panel's report how positive the current collaboration between DIT, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght is. I congratulate everyone who has worked on this project at all three institutions as well as the TU4Dublin programme lead on their work. I wish the students and staff members the very best of luck in 2019 in what is an exciting new chapter for higher education in Dublin and Ireland. I have one comment about some issues raised in the advisory group panel's report, particularly the possibility of unexpected expenditure after the merger, which I believe was raised by the HEA when recommending this report. Can the Minister of State outline how she intends to ensure that unexpected but necessary funding for TU4Dublin during this phase will not come at the expense of other higher education needs? This is particularly important in the context of a higher education system that is seriously struggling and needs a huge influx of new investment to meet demographic demand. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am aware of the Cassells report, which recommended €600 million per annum in additional current funding by 2021. We are almost there so that is the big issue of concern but I appreciate what the Minister of State is doing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Guím gach rath ar an Aire ina ról nua. Tá súil agam go dtuigeann sé go bhfuil infheistíocht, seachas costais, i gceist leis an oideachas. Tá súil agam freisin go n-aithníonn an tAire, mar iarmhúinteoir, luach ár múinteoirí atá ag mothú éadóchasach faoi láthair. I wish the Minister of State well and offer my congratulations on his appointment to his new role. As I said, I hope he sees education as the investment it truly is; it needs to stop being seen as a cost. As a former teacher, I hope he sees how demoralised our teaching profession is and that he places a value on teachers. I welcome the well-being policy statement and framework. However, I note the section that deals with the progress on the recommendations of the joint committee's report on positive mental health is the smallest section, which is disappointing over a year later. A key point that resonated with me, as a former teacher, and the reason we as a committee prioritised this, is that it is essential we give our children the toolbox of skills to cope at a time of crisis. Our young people's sense of well-being is so fragile that it shatters at the first crisis. With regard to guidance counselling, I ask that we would investigate the introduction of school based counselling, which is being done in the US, Canada and Australia. Has research been done in the Department in this regard, given it is now over a year later? Prevention and early intervention are key when it comes to our children. It is about how we hold onto our mental wellness. It is vital we make sure we do this as early as possible, so we need to be talking about the primary school level. In his statement, the Minister of State referred to the increase in the number of NEPS psychologists. The Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care launched its final report yesterday. Something that came out of it was that we only have 179 NEPS psychologists but we have 4,000 schools. We were told another 18 were to be added this year but it seems some of those psychologists must be struggling under the burden of working with so many schools. I do not know how they can provide the service that is needed. Is it true there is no real maternity cover? Is it the case that if a NEPS psychologist goes on maternity leave, there is no cover whereby someone steps in? If that is true, it needs to be addressed. If someone is covering six, seven, eight, nine or ten schools and then goes on maternity leave, and there is no one to step in, that is a crucial resource that is missing from our schools. With regard to teachers, the witnesses who contributed to the report talked about the need to look after the well-being of our teachers.If we want teachers to look after students then they need training in mental wellness. Some of the witnesses mentioned that teachers feel the challenges they face in work threatens their mental well-being. Indeed, Dr. Tony Bates paid particular attention to the important role that teachers play in schools. He said that they were the "carriers of change" but warned that too much is often expected of them and it is presumed that they are capable of solving all of society's problems within the classroom. In 2016, I was elected a Deputy but before that I was a teacher for 20 years and taught in three different schools. In all my years teaching I received only one hour of inservice training on mental wellness for a teacher. There is something very wrong with that situation. It was potluck that one of my schools thought that teachers would benefit from inservice training on wellness. I hope that the new Minister views such a situation as wrong and something that needs to be improved. It should be policy that teachers receive inservice training on mental wellness. It is not good enough to just get one hour in 20 years. Such a situation also does a disservice to students. Finally, I do not know if the Minister is aware that the Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin, and I have been working on a mindfulness initiative for everyone who works in Leinster House. It is important that we, as politicians, show the lead in this matter. If we look after our own mental health it will ensure that we are better public representatives and thus look after the staff who work here in Leinster House. A mindfulness programme has worked very successfully in Westminster. Last week, Mr. Chris Ruane, a Labour MP, was in Leinster House. Last year, I travelled to Westminster where he held a very successful international conference on mindfulness. The former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, attended the mindfulness seminar held in Leinster House last week. I hope that the new Minister will lend his support to promoting the initiative. It is important when we roll out the programme, and I do not know whether the Chair will agree, that Cabinet members participate. If we truly view well-being as crucial in the education sector then I would appreciate if the new Minister gave his time or was seen to publicly support the initiative that we are about to roll out in Leinster House. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 20 years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Good.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister. I apologise but I must leave to attend a meeting with the Ceann Comhairle on the mindfulness initiative. I might ask a question and then I have to dash but I will check the answer later. On the counselling that has been tried and tested, we are not talking about career counselling but specifically counselling. I would love to know how it is being tried and tested, what schools in Ireland it was done in and how it compared to Australia and Canada. As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, there is a myth out there that the NEPS staff are almost like counsellors in that they come into schools and do one-to-one counselling but that is certainly not their job and that is certainly not happening so I would like to know exactly how and where it was tried and tested and how it compared internationally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all the witnesses for their presentations. In addition to asking my own questions, I would like to ask some questions on behalf of Senator Ruane, who has had to go to the Seanad Chamber. When she was here a minute ago, she asked me to put certain questions to the witnesses. I will begin with my own questions. Is Ms Cahill of the view - I suspect she is - that all third level institutions should have a dedicated liaison office with trained personnel to oversee the reporting and handling of sexual harassment and assault allegations? It seems that the current reporting structures in a number of institutions can be quite unclear. I presume that lack of clarity acts as a disincentive to students when they are deciding whether to report incidents. Is there any process for collecting data on incidents of sexual assault on campus at a national level? Could the collection of data inform a standardised approach to consent classes across Ireland? Should there be a standardised approach to the provision of consent classes across all institutes? Would that help to develop best practice, allow shared learnings and avoid duplication of effort? Like others, I would like to know whether the witnesses believe we should be starting earlier. If so, should we start at post-primary level or at primary level? Does the potential exist for the higher education institutions to work with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to develop consent-based programmes that complement one another for the various stages of the school curriculum? I join Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in asking the witnesses whether they believe consent classes should be compulsory. What is the best way to ensure the people who need these classes receive them? I will conclude by asking three questions on behalf of Senator Ruane. The first two questions are for everybody. First, how well do the dignity and respect policies under which most universities operate work? What would an adequate framework for responding to reports of rape and unwanted sexual contact look like? When we introduce consent classes, there is an increase in reporting. Second, how are consent classes currently funded? What is needed to sustain consent classes and help them to grow? Senator Ruane's final question is for Mr. De Rís. Can he give the joint committee an idea of what is involved in consent classes?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for coming before the committee. Needless to say, the entire scenario is very worrying for parents and school communities. In September 2017, fire safety audits were announced for schools. Have these been carried out for all of the schools built by Western Building Systems? If so, when were they carried out, by whom and what were the results? Were the schools sent the reports relating to these audits? When the announcement in this regard was made in 2017, we were told it would take four months to complete the fire safety audits for 25 schools. How can entire structural audits be done in less than two weeks? Why would it take four months to do a fire safety check on these schools? In 2017, as Deputy Thomas Byrne stated, the previous Minister indicated that the Department would proceed to appoint a clerk of works for building project commissions. Has this happened? Does the proposal to appoint a clerk of works to school projects mean that neither the Minister nor his predecessor have faith in the building control system to deliver safe quality schools? This is particularly worrying because some of these schools were constructed under the revised 2014 building regulations regime. If there is no faith in the building regulations does this mean other Departments should follow suit? What about the Department of Health? Should a clerk of works be appointed for all major health projects, such as that relating to the new children's hospital? How far-reaching should this be if the Department does not have faith in school building projects? With regard to the recent structural audits and the 19 schools that have reopened with external fencing in place, what are the risks being addressed by this fencing? Why was it determined that the schools were nonetheless safe? As Deputy Thomas Byrne asked, has any of the parties given an undertaking to the Department that it will pay for the works to be done? What is the estimated cost? I presume Western Building Systems will certainly not be carrying out any of the remedial works. Will the Minister clarify the position? What contingency plans were put in place prior to the fire audits in order to provide alternative arrangements for schools if something were to be discovered? I presume contingency plans have been put in place for the structural audits and I presume something was in place in the event of a fire safety audit requiring closure. In the instances where the closure of a school is affecting other community facilities, such as in Tyrrelstown, is there a contingency plan or other arrangements for the communities there? They are really suffering. We all saw the news reports last week regarding the basketball team. What is being put in place to help other community events in areas that have little or no free space? For how long will the community centre be shut? When the Minister's predecessor came before the committee last September, we asked about the rules for disallowing contractors to tender. He indicated that one of the rules relates to grave professional misconduct. Does this mean that Western Building Systems cannot tender, particularly as what happened in this instance certainly constitutes grave professional misconduct?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The question was to ask the Minister if he had a contingency plan in place if the fire safety audit showed that something was lacking because the school could not possibly be kept open if it could burn down in 15 minutes if it had not been properly fireproofed. Are there contingency arrangements in place?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	By way of follow-up, I still do not believe the Minister can instill any hope in the 2014 building regulations if that extra level of oversight is needed. As he mentioned, self-certification is the issue. We are seeing the same issue in apartments. Experts are saying it does not work. Therefore, the Government needs to revisit the issue.Regarding the major projects, what about an extension to a school or a PE hall? Do they get that extra layer of oversight structurally? The Minister referred to the external fencing. I asked what risk is being addressed with that external fencing and how those schools are nonetheless safe. I presume Western Building Systems will not be carrying out any of the remedial work. Is that correct?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I remind members to turn their mobile phones off when attending committee meetings. It is proposed to defer the private session until the end of the meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode because they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting. Television coverage and web-streaming can also be adversely affected. The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders on the uptake of apprenticeships and traineeships. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Jim Murray, director of academic affairs and deputy CEO of the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, Mr. Brendan McGinty, chairperson of Skillnet Ireland, Dr. Mary-Liz Trant, executive director of SOLAS and Mr. Phil O'Flaherty, principal officer, further education and training section of the Department of Education and Skills. I will invite witnesses to make a brief opening statement, a maximum of three minutes each, which will be followed by engagement with members of the committee. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Dr. Jim Murray to make his opening statement. 
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I ask Mr. McGinty to conclude as he has exceeded his time.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	There will be an opportunity to engage further with members.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. O'Flaherty.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take one more set of questions from Deputy Funchion, go back to the panel of witnesses and then come back for another group of three.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. O'Flaherty. He can send any additional information to the other witnesses through the committee.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentations. I note that Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board, WWETB, is developing a nearly zero energy building, NZEB, centre of excellence and Limerick Institute of Technology is working with it to develop the training content for the programme. This will upskill electricians, plumbers, blocklayers and others. It is terrible that WWETB has to fight for money despite the work that it is doing. This is the wave of the future and funding will be necessary if we are to address fuel poverty and improve our energy security.While SOLAS has started new apprenticeships in auctioneering and property services, what actions is it taking to create them in services that improve the quality of the houses being auctioned, rented or sold? Building standards are still under-regulated and inspected, although there is self-certification, while there is a severe lack of trained professionals to do the work required. I know that many of the people who work in the areas of renovation, retrofitting and energy efficiency - the new green areas of the economy - have not been trained in Ireland and must travel elsewhere to acquire that expertise. What is SOLAS doing at regional level to upskill in and support the retrofit sector? What is its policy in that area? Has it started to build on the pioneering work of Waterford and Wexford ETB in the area of retrofitting, especially considering the requirement to meet current and incoming EU energy efficiency and NZ targets? I note that the action plan to expand apprenticeship and traineeship in Ireland 2016 to 2020 includes a target to have 67 apprenticeship programmes in place by the end of 2020 in new industry areas. There is a clear upward trend, but are we preparing the apprentices for the reality of our changing economy and where we need to go? Regarding the €120 million allocated for apprenticeships in 2018 and the €34.6 million allocated for traineeships to 2020, what is the breakdown in terms of how much has been invested in climate mitigation or adaptation measures, including energy efficiency measures, as compared to the level of investment in fossil fuel employment? I believe there is talk of the European Social Fund which funds the new apprenticeship and traineeship fund being used to upskill fossil fuel workers in Germany and the Czech Republic. Has the Department approached anyone at EU level or prepared any draft plan for the midlands to avail of such funding opportunities? I am glad to see moves in the right direction towards gender balance, but SOLAS's submission does state the proportion of apprentices who are women is still 1%. I am glad to hear that there is a move to encourage them to move beyond certain areas such as beauty therapy and hairdressing which quite clearly are saturated markets that are vulnerable to cyclical dips in the economy. Care work is also an industry in which there are very poor pay levels and conditions. Is there, for example, an Athena SWAN award equivalent for institutions and businesses in this area? In addition, what departmental actions are being taken in the light of the fact that just 2.75% of apprentices declare a disability? Furthermore, is there an apprenticeship expo? Could this become a compulsory part of the transition year school programme?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I asked for a breakdown to see how much of the €120 million allocated for apprenticeships and the €34.6 million allocated for traineeships in 2018 has been invested in climate mitigation or adaptation measures to achieve energy efficiency. What is the exact policy on the retrofit sector? I refer to the work done by Waterford Wexford ETB in that regard. Is it something that will be addressed many years into the future? That is not where we need to be; rather, we need to deal with it in the here and now. Is there a timeframe for building on the pioneering work done by Waterford Wexford ETB? What is the plan and when will it be implemented? The Irish Green Building Council stated people were not being trained in Ireland in retrofitting, which is appalling. It is the new green economy. Many employees, particularly in the midlands, will need to be retrained and upskilled. What is the plan in that regard?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses very much for coming in today. I was struck by something in Mr. Costello's opening statement which said "The Department is, of course, aware that there is a degree of dissatisfaction with the quality of the service provided by Caranua." There is much more than a degree of dissatisfaction. It was said in a meeting of this committee earlier this year, and I will repeat it, that the State has failed. Worse still, it continues to fail and that is to our shame as a State. Before I ask my questions, I commend and refer to all of those who have advocated and who continue to advocate so courageously for the survivors. They have never given up and they have been so resilient against all the odds. What has been done by the survivors for the survivors has been incredible. My questions centre around the issue of the appeal process. What are the Department's concerns regarding the very different number of appeals granted by the former appeals officers, of which only 8% were successful, and granted by the two appeals officers appointed in April 2017? Under these officers 43% of appeals were successful. How have the officials satisfied themselves that the former appeals officer was not overly harsh, looking at the difference in those statistics? How does the Department explain the very low number of appeals submitted by applicants to the fund? There were 399 over three years. Is the number low because of Caranua's failure to tell applicants they could appeal, which is again a symptom of poor communication? Considering the very high number of appeals won by applicants since 2017, how has the Department ensured that Caranua's refusals are fair and in line with the Act, particularly as we have reports of this not being the case?  Similarly there have been allegations of abuse of the appeals process on the part of Caranua, for example the introduction of new reasons for refusal once the appeals process has commenced and refusals on grounds not contained in the Act or in the criteria. Is the Department aware of these allegations? If yes, what has it done to look into them? Has the Department ever seen a list of the reasons given by Caranua in the determination letters or further reasons for refusal only being given after the appeals process commenced? If the Department has not seen the letters, perhaps it would like to ask to do so and to consider that information.  We have also heard of several applications for services made in 2015 by applicants who have serious disabilities, who urgently need help, and who are still waiting. In these cases we believe Caranua initially refused to issue a determination letter and then only agreed to issue the letter 12 months later, after investigation by the appeals officer. The applicants were then refused the services. The applicants successfully appealed in 2017, having waited 18 months for the appeal decision, or still have not been provided with the service. Is the Department aware of these particular applications? Does it have any information on them? Is that the case? I believe some applicants who were recently interviewed on radio are now considering legal action. It is estimated that the cost of these cases could exceed €500,000 and that this money might well come out of the fund. Has the Department received reports of this? If the cost was to come out of the fund, at what stage would the Department step in to prevent the fund suffering such losses? What does the Department think of such cases and what do they tell us about the operation of the fund by Caranua? What can we, as a committee, and the Department do to improve matters for survivors in the time the fund has left? The service really has failed to provide survivors with a service.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I want clarification on a matter. It was said that the Department had no details on the survey that showed 90% positive feedback and that we had to contact Caranua for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It strikes us as quite unusual that there was 90% positive feedback, considering the fact that this is not what we hear. Has it not struck the Department as a little bit strange? The Department has a role in oversight and accountability in matters relating to governance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the freefone number available from a landline and is it free from the UK? I believe 40% of the survivors are in the UK. Is it free from a mobile or just from a landline?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is something we need to establish.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for attending today's meeting and making their insightful presentations. I would like to ask a couple of questions about upskilling in the energy-efficiency sector. As Ms White will be aware, Waterford-Wexford Education and Training Board is developing a centre of excellence in the area of nearly zero-energy building. Limerick Institute of Technology has worked with the board to develop the training content for programmes that will upskill electricians, plumbers and blocklayers, etc. I wonder whether Ms White might comment on this specific project. Are other ETBs looking to take it up? What lessons can be learned from this initiative as we seek to make sure there is investment in apprenticeships and to recognise the need to shift to the new green economy, which will provide job opportunities? Do the education and training boards need supports in delivering these programmes? Are they getting enough funding and supports for the shift to a green economy that is needed? It has been said that many of those who are working in new green areas like renovation, retrofitting and energy-efficiency have been trained overseas. What is being done at a regional level to upskill and support the retrofitting sector through the ETBs? Does the ETBI have a policy in that area? I would like to comment on the gender balance issue as it applies to those who are being fast-tracked into information technology. One of the submissions recommended that there should be a campaign to encourage women to take up apprenticeships. What would that look like? How is it imagined that this could be done in the information technology area and across the wider apprenticeship sector? I mentioned last week that an incentive - perhaps the equivalent of the Athena SWAN award - might be needed to encourage institutions and businesses to get involved in this area. What would the witnesses think of that as an idea? What actions are being taken in light of the fact that just 2.75% of apprentices declare themselves to have a disability? What are we doing in this regard? Mr. Davitt used the term "de-commute" and I ask him to elaborate on that. What would make this concept more attractive to employees and employers alike? Dr. Smyth wondered whether tourism and hospitality should be a leaving certificate subject. Is tourism and hospitality, or something very similar to it, not a subject on the leaving certificate applied curriculum? Has it been reviewed to determine how successful it has been? If tourism and hospitality has been successful as a leaving certificate applied subject, could that help to persuade the Department of Education and Skills to put it on the leaving certificate as well? Has there been an increase in uptake in this sector as a result of tourism and hospitality being a leaving certificate applied subject?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. My questions were not answered.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In response to Dr. Smyth, I was not questioning tourism and hospitality being placed on the leaving certificate. I was wondering, given that it is on the leaving certificate applied, whether it has been successful and if that could be used to strengthen the argument to roll it out to the leaving certificate. I am in agreement with him.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the ETBI intend to roll out a policy?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The ETBs have a crucial role to play in the move towards a green economy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome Mr. Hayes. I also acknowledge the work of his predecessor, Mr. Eamon Stack, and the important work he has done in the role. I am quite moved by the presentation, which was not typical of what we get. It is a breath of fresh air.It is what Mr. Hayes will lend to the role. I thank him for sharing his personal story of Eavan Kate and his whole family with us. It struck me when he said the singular mark of civilised society was to care for the most vulnerable, the voiceless and the disabled. At the very end Mr. Hayes said the most important person is the child, the adolescent and the adult recipient of the services, and they are at the heart and centre of everything the council does. If that is the case, I do not see how the NCSE can go wrong with Mr. Hayes at the helm. I thank Mr. Hayes for his invitation to the research conference and I am sure if members are free, the committee will send a representation. What are the two biggest challenges facing special needs education and how should they be addressed?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I understand the only item of legislation the Department has been asked to addressed relates to the SUSI grant, my questions relate more broadly to Brexit. What efforts is the Department making to ensure Irish research will be multipolar and international? All of the presentations in the Brexit and Horizon Europe workshop proceedings mentioned that the issue of researcher mobility was crucial, while one of the speakers stated mobility in Europe was a key aspect of research. There is real concern about whether we will be able to compete for graduates if we cannot train our own. The area of climate knowledge is fast-paced and changing and the need for skill sharing and mobility has become twice as important. What efforts are we making to ensure we will be more independent and self-reliant in acquiring skills for the green economy? At a previous committee meeting on apprenticeships I noted that there was a severe lack of engineers and construction workers for retrofitting and other green build activities, whereas most of those who are available have had to be trained abroad. The United Kingdom is the closest country in which people speak English. In advance of Brexit, what efforts are we making to cultivate these skills, given that many of them were built in the United Kingdom because of EU directives and regulations, including the nearly zero energy building standard? According to the Irish Green Building Council, 54% of Irish organisations that participated in the World Green Building Trends 2018 SmartMarket report expect their projects to be green by 2021, well above the global average of 47%. The projections are led not only by client demand but also EU regulations. When the regulations change after Brexit, from where will our skill set come? The Minister indicated that Horizon 2020 was within the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, but I think it is within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills. The United Kingdom is the second largest recipient of funding under Horizon 2020. It has received 15.2% of the grants distributed, or €5.7 billion, under the programme thus far.As well as funding nuclear research projects, Horizon 2020 supports scientific partnerships with countries across Europe and beyond, provides access to large-scale international research facilities and joint infrastructure, and offers fellowships for talented researchers to spend time working abroad. In the wake of Brexit, is there a way this funding could be accessed by Ireland? Could it be used to return to our recent high standards after years of cuts and decline? As the UK loses access to Horizon 2020, many UK academics will be looking for English language opportunities. What steps are we taking to attract academics from the UK, including the many brilliant Irish academics?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister of State for her reply but my question was not about apprenticeships but more specifically about the green economy. This is happening abroad and I wonder what we are doing in Ireland. People are mostly being trained in retrofitting skills and green build activities abroad, so what are we doing in Ireland?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A very obvious issue on which we do not need to do any research is that there is a lack of engineers and retrofitters. We should be leading on the green economy and with Brexit-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am talking specifically about retrofitting.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Good. I will keep saying it, with the greatest respect to the Minister of State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I congratulate the Minister. Like Deputy Funchion, I will refer to his question about the strategic direction he wants the education and training sector to travel in over the next three years. I would say that it should be one that has equality at its heart. I agree with Deputy Funchion about equality of access and opportunity for our students, but we also need to address the elephant in the room, which is pay inequality and the crisis it is causing in teacher recruitment. We have four-teacher primary schools not just in rural Ireland, but in Dublin. When a teacher is ill or on a training course they cannot be replaced. These are schools in which there are teaching principals so it can be the case that a teaching principal who has fifth and sixth class students has to take in first and second class students or even junior and senior infants. Something has to shift. We need to value our teachers, who are so under-resourced and overburdened at the minute. We also need to look at the status of our non-teaching staff and to value them. There are more than 3,500 secretaries in our education system. The salaries of the vast majority of those are determined by boards of management, which leads to different working terms and conditions. We have secretaries with no security of employment and no occupational pensions who are forced to sign on during the summer. As former teachers, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor and the Minister himself will know that schools cannot function without their secretaries. They are everything to students and staff. There needs to be a shift in that area as well. The issue of forward planning and new buildings has been brought up by my colleagues. I brought this up when myself, Deputy Thomas Byrne and Deputy O'Loughlin travelled to Tullamore last year. It relates to this thing of announcing schools. Last year it was announced that a new primary school for the Goatstown-Stillorgan area in my constituency will open in September 2019. The parent of a two year old or a three year old child will think that is great and that a brand new school will open in 2019 when the truth is the site has not even been identified. Ballinteer Educate Together national school has been waiting for seven or eight years. The project has been moved around and does not even have planning permission yet. We now hear that the Department has applied for planning permission to locate it in an industrial unit in Sandyford beside a site on which it looks likely that 460 apartments will be built. Traffic chaos and safety issues will arise from this school being located beside a construction site. I do not understand the logic of announcing schools and then misleading the public by saying that the doors will open a year later when the site has not even been identified. The Minister should at least be honest with the public and say that he hopes that this will happen but that we actually do not have sites identified for the schools we are announcing.As elected representatives, people come to us saying that this is great news and asking where exactly is the location for the school. Then the other school, which has waited seven years and does not have planning permission, wonders how they were successful when they have been moved around to different parts of the constituency. Take Ballinteer Educate Together which is now temporarily located in Churchtown and is still waiting for planning. That is something that needs to be addressed. On strategy, does the Minister intend to integrate the recommendations made in the Joint Committee on Education and Skills report on relationships and sexuality education, and what is his timeline? The committee also did a very detailed report on mental health. I would love to see these reports inform strategy and be taken seriously rather than gathering dust on a shelf. In the last quarter of last year, the Minister's predecessor was to have 500 teachers in DEIS primary and post-primary schools trained in the delivery of resilience building. Did that happen? How were those schools selected? How were those teachers selected? What are the criteria for deciding which schools or teachers received the training? I agree with Deputy Funchion, and have said it many times, that a toolbox of skills to deal with a crisis is the most critical thing that we can give our children. I am an advocate for mindfulness and resilience building, which was one of the recommendations of our report. I, the Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin, and Senator Black have been instrumental in introducing mindfulness into Leinster House. We think that it is very important that we in Leinster House lead. The previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, attended the meeting we held before Christmas to lend his support to it. The sessions are held on Wednesdays between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m., and six more are scheduled. This is happening is Sweden and the UK. If the Minister cares to pop in, he should do so. That gives a signal that we are leading on the importance of protecting our mental health. It would be a good signal if the Minister were to lend his support. The typical excuse for Deputies, never mind Ministers, is that they do not have time, but that is exactly when one should pop in and do some mindfulness training. What is the extent of the Minister's engagement with the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, Deputy Bruton, on broadband connectivity? It is not only an issue for rural Ireland. In my time training in NUI Maynooth the overhead projector was as technical as it got, but now the technology is fantastic. I was a music teacher and used YouTube to bring the music to the students so that they could see the performer. Interactive whiteboards are also an invaluable tool. How are people in Glencullen, which they tell me is not far from Grafton Street, coping? I do not think a music teacher there has that access because there is no broadband connectivity. It must be next to impossible in rural areas of Ireland. There is inequality because pupils are not getting the same experience, and that is only in my subject, never mind any other subject. Teachers are heavily reliant on this. I would love an update on the National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development in Ireland 2014 to 2020 if the Minister is in a position to provide it now or later. That was focused primarily on educating children and students about sustainable development rather than seizing the opportunity to make the very schools themselves greener. A quick example of that was apparent when the Joint Committee on Climate Action visited a school in Tipperary before Christmas. It had done a great deal of retrofitting and put six solar panels on a roof which could take 30. It is outrageous that that is the message we are giving our students, who if they ask why there are only six panels when it would fit 30 are told that there is no point because the school cannot get money back from the grid. We must look at that. There should be a solar revolution on every public building, including school buildings. Schools are a perfect investment for that. Has the Minister spoken to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment about the need for the Government to bring in measures that would not just put the responsibility on the students who are doing fantastic work through the green flags initiative, for instance? It would mean the Government stepping up to invest in and incentivising our schools becoming greener, which unfortunately did not happen in that school in Tipperary where there was no incentive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. I hope to see the Minister at the event.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Great.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister said he would follow up on specific questions. The action plan said that the teaching of resilience would be delivered by quarter four of last year. Were those 500 teachers delivered? The Minister can get back to me afterwards if needs be. Regarding greening our schools, is the Government stepping up to facilitate schools to sell energy back to the grid? Could the Minister talk to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment about that? As a follow up to what the Minister said about delivering PE and doing it properly, there has been resistance. Since I was elected here, on several occasions, I have raised the need to carry out an audit of schools to see which ones do not have PE halls. I am aware of one in my constituency. The school was built in 1980 and still does not have a PE hall. Again, if we come back to equality, we need to establish which schools do not have PE halls because they are at a disadvantage in delivering that new curriculum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe as ucht a gcur i láthair inniu. I thank the delegates for their presentations. I have a couple of questions, most of which are for the Department.  The Department describes a plan to record the support schools provide for pupils with special educational needs as beneficial both for schools and children and best practice. However, as the Education for Persons with Special Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004 has not been fully implemented, it is not yet a statutory requirement for schools to have individual educational plans, IEPs, in place. How many students with special educational needs do not have an individual learning plan? We know that there is a need to put structured IEPs in place as such plans are essential for students with Down's syndrome. All of the stakeholders are in agreement that IEPs must be co-ordinated by teachers who should be given non-contact time and provided with training and, critically, resources. How does the Department plan to ensure all of this will happen? Let us remember that we are talking about a fundamental human right. When, if ever, does the Department intend to fully implement the EPSEN Act? If it does not do so, the legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written. It is appalling that it still has not been fully implemented in 2019. The NCSE has recommended that an equitable day activity scheme be developed for all students with complex and special educational needs. I understand an implementation group has been convened. What is the timeframe for completion of the review? What are possible solutions in the interim?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mr. Ward has mentioned that planning is essential and that it is part of good professional practice. As someone who comes from the teaching profession, I take it as a slight on teachers who are not being given the time needed to engage in such professional planning. That is part of the frustration among parents and teachers who do not have the time they need to engage in the planning needed to give the children the proper and thorough education they deserve.  Mr. Ward mentioned the many resources made available up to 2011. If we reflect on what has happened in the past eight years, how many initiatives have been brought forward in schools since 2011? There is an overload. I have only been out of the teaching profession for three years since I was elected to the Dáil. Mr. Ward mentioned circulars. I had reached circular overload by 2016, by which time I had been involved in teaching for 20 years. Overload seems to have been reached since 2011. Teachers were reaching initiative and circular overload because the resources needed were not being put in place. Teachers are being told to implement these initiatives; they are being told about the drive-bys and that they face inspection after inspection. They know, however, that it is just a case of filling in a sheet or a form, but they cannot give children the proper education they deserve and should experience because they do not have the resources to do so. They need that non-contact time and funding. Essentially, they need training. I worked in a DEIS school with many fantastic children who enriched my teaching experience because of their vast array of special educational needs. That is why I loved where I was teaching. However, it was frustrating as we only received a certain level of continuing professional development training. Someone would come in the afternoon, or when a specific need had presented in the school, rather than training being provided at the very beginning, as Ms Brady suggested. Teachers do not need to be trained when a specific need presents, rather they need to be armed with all of the training they need in order that when an issue presents, they will be ready to hit the ground running. That is what every teacher in a primary and secondary school wants and what every parent of a child with special educational needs wants. It is also what the parents of a child who does not have special educational needs want. For children to receive their fundamental human right to a proper, inclusive and thorough education, teachers must be resourced. They must have the non-contact time they need and it is essential that they be trained properly. I know that this is not Mr. Ward's decision to make but the Minister's.He must prioritise our children with special educational needs. That means not passing the buck and saying it is down to the school to allocate the resources when they present themselves. We have had enough of that approach in our schools and it is not working. I ask Mr. Ward, as a result of this meeting, to pass the buck to the Minister and put the proper resources in place.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While that may seem to be the Government's position, it is simply not good enough for the Minister to set it out in reply to a parliamentary question or in a statement in the Dáil. Both he and the previous Minister should have issued a direction to all schools that this practice simply cannot happen. There is a lack of oversight and children are being placed on reduced timetables behind closed doors. These children are being denied their constitutional right to education. We need immediate clarity from the Minister in the form of a directive to schools stating that this practice cannot continue. When students are put on a reduced timetable, how are the teachers selected and what training do they have in teaching children with a disability or behavioural difficulties? Are there cases where teachers are not present and the burden is placed on special needs assistants? With regard to the monitoring, assessment and oversight that are required, during a whole school evaluation of management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, or an incidental drive-by inspection, do inspectors ever ask whether there are children on a reduced timetable and if they can see how that is being managed? If that is not the case, these questions must be added to the list to ensure inspectors know when they visit schools that this needs to be checked immediately. Apart from finding out what is happening in CSPE, English, history, Irish or physical education, are inspectors asking if there are children on a reduced timetable? I suspect not but I want the matter clarified. Has the Department of Education and Skills issued guidelines on this issue? In studies or research that have been done, what is the maximum number of weeks that a child has been deprived of education? Can a child remain on a reduced timetable indefinitely? When schools decide to put a child on a reduced timetable, how do they decide what subjects the child should be exposed to? I presume they are completely excluded from PE, art, music and any other subject that has a social element. They will not get access to physical education despite the childhood obesity crisis, or access to art, music or woodwork because schools will definitely not want to let these children into woodwork class. Is that what is happening? What we are doing is appalling from the perspective of the full development and well-being of our children. Are children on a reduced timetable completely excluded at break time? If they are in school between 9 a.m. and 12 noon, do they not go on a break with the other children between 11 a.m. and 11.15 a.m.? If not, has the impact of this been examined? Have the views of teachers been established through anonymous surveys? Is there a question on this in the surveys of students and teachers that are conducted as part of a WSE-MLL? Teachers should be surveyed on whether a reduced timetable operates in their schools and, if so, how they think it is working for the benefit of the students. These questions need to be included. I do not believe reduced timetables should ever be used. That is the issue but if they are continuing, they need to be tackled straight away. To be clear, I am completely against reduced timetables. Has the Department done any research? The Minister says reduced timetables should not be used but he has not issued a directive to schools to make sure they are not used. What alternatives are available for children? Have these been considered? What do other countries do when an issue arises with behavioural difficulties? Surely they do not remove a child's access to education or to specific subjects. What percentage of students who have been put on reduced timetables return to the full timetable?Is it just a way of eventually getting them out of the school because it becomes so difficult for parents in full-time employment to manage the phone calls to come and get the child? It also makes the children feel so much less part of the school community that they move away. Do we know whether those on a reduced timetable get counselling, even from the guidance counsellor? It is just wrong on so many levels. What we should get from shining a light on this today is that the Minister will write to schools to put an end to it and research will done on putting in place proper alternatives to give support to children with disabilities and children who enter school already having a feeling of alienation and segregation, which is made worse by putting them in a room on their own without proper educational supports. The answer to how it is monitored or assessed seems to be that it is not. What can we do?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank our guests for their presentations. My questions are a follow-up to my earlier questions. I recognise that much of the issue is caused by schools being under-resourced or because the proper supports that ensure children have the well-rounded education they deserve are not in place due to a lack of investment. Who decides which subjects a child has access to in his or her curriculum? What are the criteria? Is a child entitled to learn English and Irish but not other subjects? I refer especially to second level with its broader curriculum, given that in primary school all the teachers have the same subject-related training whereas it differs in secondary school. After it has been decided or, perhaps, agreed that a child has been put on a reduced timetable, are the parents given any information in that regard? The teachers have spent time with the child, have taught him or her subjects and know how he or she is progressing. What happens if a parent disagrees and does not want the child to be on a reduced timetable? I ask because Mr. Goff and Mr. Golden will have experienced the issue as principals. In that scenario, what would happen for the parents and the principal? Is a clear plan for the transition back to a full timetable given to parents? A plan could include details of how the transition will work and a roadmap to return the child to a full timetable. Does the Department write to principals to ask whether they operate a reduced timetable, how many students are on it, how a decision is made, whether the parents have agreed and what supports are needed to help the child return to a full timetable? I refer to an assessment of the supports and of how the timetable operates. If my son or daughter was put on a reduced timetable and I was in full-time work, I would not be able to collect him or her from school. Would he or she have to sit in the office with the secretary and wait to be collected? If so, that is segregation because the rest of the school would see the child sitting in the office. It cannot be good for the office staff either if there are behavioural difficulties and the child has to wait in the office for two or three hours. Even the best-behaved students would misbehave if they were left for two hours in an office. What would happen in that scenario? I cannot believe that a school would call at 9.10 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. and say it is time for a child to go home.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am delighted to hear that those questions feature in the DEIS inspection. Maybe there is some data gathering there. Does it feature on the WSE-MLL?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is it something at which we need to look? Has there ever been a recommendation following a DEIS inspection? Is it the case that a suggestion has been made that there be a reduced timetable? It would be interesting to know if the inspectorate has ever followed through on this issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, this is not an accusation that is being levelled at the school. The Department is, however, letting schools fly solo on this issue and giving them zero support. It is quite happy not to have the data.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The operation of reduced timetables is appalling and it does a huge disservice to our most vulnerable children. There is a lack of support for principals and teachers in some very difficult situations, where they feel they are being forced into operating this. I do not know how this has been allowed to continue and how the Department, and Minister after Minister, have turned a blind eye to it. How are teachers selected to be with a student? What qualifications does a teacher need to be the one-on-one person for a child? Are there times where it is not a teacher but a special needs assistant, SNA, who is there? When SNAs are hired, are they informed that there may be occasions when they will be with the most difficult student in the school as part of their job? I do not believe this is part of the SNA job as they are supposed to support a child's education with the teacher in the classroom. In such a scenario, the SNA and the student would suffer. What rooms are being used for children on a reduced timetable? How suitable are they? Did any details of them come up in the survey? Do the witnesses have any idea of the maximum number of weeks this can apply for? Ms Hanahoe said it was reviewed after six weeks but has a child been ever been on a reduced timetable for half a year, or even longer?Are parents always informed of the option under section 29? What happens when the parents do not agree? There are many questions to be asked. When Ms Hanahoe was speaking, the fact that we simply do not have the resources stood out. This lack of resources is appalling because it does a disservice to her, as a principal trying to run her school, and to all students, not just those with difficulties. What does she need? Is she aware of anything at all that the Department is doing to help? Ms Hanahoe outlined cases involving major behavioural difficulties. How does she choose the teacher? In the context of one case, she referred to the "teacher or special needs assistant" and referred to what happened when the adult stepped away. Is it the case that there is sometimes only an SNA and not a teacher? Has Ms Hanahoe ever received a communication from the Department on the operation of reduced timetables? During an inspection, has it ever arisen?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The position of the Department of Education and Skills is that a reduced timetable should not be used as a behavioural management technique or as a de facto suspension or expulsion. How has the Department checked? Is Ms Cregg telling me that the Department believes schools are only using reduced timetables in exceptional circumstances? Is the Department aware that Traveller representative groups have highlighted inappropriate use of reduced timetables? Is that the only source of the Department's awareness? It is shocking that the groups have had to bring that to the attention of the Department. Many others are suffering due to abuse of the reduced timetable option. When did the Department last communicate with schools to clarify the position that it should only arise in exceptional circumstances? How has the Department been checking that it is only being used in exceptional circumstances? Tusla has outlined how guidance has been provided to schools to the effect that the exclusion of a student for part of the school day as a sanction or asking a parent to keep a child from school as a sanction amounts to a suspension. The Department maintains the measure cannot be used as a de facto suspension but yet guidance has been provided to schools that a reduced timetable amounts in fact to a suspension. Can the Department explain the position? Either it is happening or it is not. If it is, how many section 29 applications have been made? How many parents have appealed such moves? My fear is that parents are not being informed. I believe parents of the most vulnerable and of students from disadvantaged areas who are being subjected to reduced timetables are not aware of their rights. I believe they are unaware of how to challenge such a measure. What are we doing for parents to ensure they can advocate properly for the right of their children to education? What supports are in place to ensure that children are getting their right to education? Does the Department check what happens when a parent disagrees? What if a parent disagrees but then the child is put out? What happens then? Are children being put on reduced timetables against the wishes of their parents? Why is the operation of reduced timetables in schools not included in whole-school evaluation of management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, inspections? I understand it is not because I asked the question two weeks ago. How easy would it be to add a question on this when an inspector comes for three or four days to a school? An inspector could ask whether a school operates a reduced timetable and ask for all the facts, including how the students go on the reduced timetable. The students and parents are surveyed as part of the WSE-MLL inspections. Why not add a question to those surveys? When inspectors meet the boards of management as part of the WSE-MLL process, are board members asked how many reduced timetables they have approved and why? Have inspectors formed the view that all the members of the board of management are okay with the measure? Are they simply going with the wishes of the principal? How well informed are board members on this? What is the plan now? The Minister has said he is not happy with this but we need more than that. The Department has assured us it is working with Tusla with a view to ensuring that the use of reduced timetables is limited only to those exceptional circumstances where it is necessary. What does that mean? Can the Department break that down for me? What are we going to see? What is the plan? How is the Department going to address it and stop this practice? How is the Department going to support principals like Ms Hanahoe, who has spoken of a health and safety danger? Ms Hanahoe has outlined how there is danger with the behaviour that she is trying to manage in her school. That is unfair on students and principals and it is not safe. What is the Department putting in place? What is the greater plan? For violent and aggressive outbursts there has to be a better option than reduced timetables. I simply do not understand how the Department has been blind and deaf to all of this. It fell to us to shine this light. The best thing that has happened is that the light is being shone on this. Did it really take until June 2019 to shine a light on the use and misuse of reduced timetables? Did it take this long to shine the light on the dire need to resource our teachers, principals and schools to provide the education to which every child has a right?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sorry, I-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the answer referring to the process, I also have questions on that aspect, as well as where the parent and the child fits in and if the best advice has been taken on board. I asked when the Department last wrote to schools outlining its position. The Department's position is that reduced timetables are not to be used as a behavioural management technique, yet they are being used as such. My other question, therefore, which I again asked earlier, is what supports are being given to schools to help manage violent and aggressive students. Mr. Ward mentioned listening to the stakeholders as being very helpful. One thing to take away from today's meeting is that there is a child in Ireland who has been on a reduced timetable for two years. Some inspection or other has missed that and the Department has missed that as well. One child is one child too many. It is disgraceful that a child has been placed on a reduced timetable for two years. That needs to stop.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for attending and presenting. The financial pressure on students is extraordinary. We could deal with each question and each aspect of the SUSI programme individually, but that would fundamentally be to miss the bigger picture, that being, underinvestment in the core funding of third level institutions by the Government. We should not ignore that in our discussions today - it is the elephant in the room. We have the second highest student fees in the EU. If the UK leaves, we will be promoted to the No. 1 spot. That is the Government unfairly placing the burden on students. It must change. The Government has chosen to cast a blind eye on the country's crumbling third level institutions.In 2008, State spending on third level education was just under €9,000 per student and it is less than €5,000 per student 11 years later. That does not make sense. It is no wonder we saw reports yesterday that Trinity College Dublin has dropped more than 40 places in the international university ranking. It used to be in the top 100 universities. Core funding is linked to everything we are discussing today and that has been ignored by the Government. Despite every member of this committee seeking to have the concerns raised in the Cassells report addressed, they have been ignored by the Government. Do the student witnesses feel that if core funding were addressed, it would relieve the current pressure on students? The non-adjacent rate criteria have increased the distance from home to study location from 24 km to 45 km. I have met representatives from the USI a few times. In its pre-budget submission, the USI refers to Birr, County Offaly, which is 40 km from the nearest third level institution, namely, Athlone Institute of Technology. However, the earliest a student from Birr can arrive at Athlone Institute of Technology if using a bus service is 1.25 p.m. That is of no use to students as they will have missed half a day. The USI also mentions that Killarney is 36 km from the Institute of Technology, Tralee, but the cost of commuting to the town is only €1.50 less per week by bus or 10 cent less per week by train than the cost of student accommodation. The non-adjacent rate criteria must be reviewed. I appreciate that as the criteria apply generally, they may be seen as fair, but the methods of calculation seem to make little or no sense. They do not take into account glaring issues as outlined in the case studies I mention. We have appalling public transport in this country, especially in the more rural parts outside Dublin where students face greater dilemmas when the 45 km criterion applies. We must ensure the calculations are done in a more effective way. I understand the transparency involved in using Google maps but it does not take into account realities for students as outlined in the two case studies I mentioned. Has there been any engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, specifically with respect to the provision of public transport to third level institutions? Does SUSI envisage a framework that would address some of the issues outlined in the Athlone and Kerry cases I have brought to the attention of the committee thanks to the work of the USI? We cannot ignore the core funding aspect in discussing these matters but we also cannot ignore equality of access to education. If we are discussing barriers to people accessing SUSI, we must consider barriers to people simply trying to access education. This brings into play the matter of direct provision. Asylum seekers are currently considered international students when applying for higher education, meaning they must pay somewhere between €10,000 and €20,000 in fees. What sort of country are we? This indicates to asylum seekers that they can only go to second level. That is the message we are giving these people who are most vulnerable and who we should try to support and protect. We are meant to ensure they can get a fair shot in our country but we are saying "No". It is a policy matter but one we must address. A number of measures have been taken, including a pilot support scheme, but that has been in place since 2015. How long should something remain a pilot scheme before real and long-lasting measures are implemented? We are four years on. Could the criterion of proving residency for three of the past five years in order to be eligible for SUSI services be reviewed? Those who are seeking asylum do not get to choose how long they will be living in our country so how will they meet that criterion? They are seeking refuge and also a fair shot. Education is the greatest equaliser of all but only if we make it equal.That is a conversation that needs to be had. The criterion regarding residency for three of the last five years must be reviewed.  Ms Fanning outlined the dependency criterion in great detail. I do not understand why all students up to the age of 23 years are classed as dependants, regardless of their living status, whether they are homeless or are not living with their families because they had decided not to or had been forced from their home. We are not considering these cases. Will someone explain the logic of this, as it is not the reality of many students today? I anticipate that it relates to how mature students are classified as such from the age of 23 but that does not relate to dependency. Many people are totally independent from the age of 18, 19 or 20. Does SUSI or the USI have information on how many students fall into this category of being independent under the SUSI criteria were it not for the age restriction?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is Mr. Connolly saying that it can be challenged in respect of the shortest and most direct route? Can it be challenged when a student cannot get to college until 1.25 p.m. and will miss vital lectures? Is this a reason for challenging it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is there any way of reviewing it so it is not just about distance but about access to education? The reason the person is going to college is to attend lectures but what if the transport is not there or if it is there but the student misses his or her lecture? Should that not be the full point and a reason to include-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We therefore need the Minister to change those guidelines. We need the Department to acknowledge it might be an idea to follow the student and the access to education, rather than transport that will not get that student to college on time.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I raised the dependency criterion. Again, we need to go the Minister to point out that this does not reflect reality.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire has said, issues related to going back to school put immense stress on many vulnerable families. This should never be the case if we claim to have free education. Schools should never have to ask parents to fund their basic running costs. Government must fund schools appropriately. This could start in primary schools with the full restoration of the capitation grant to 2010 levels. I respectfully suggest that there needs to be a change in how schools engage if they are to continue with voluntary contributions. The voluntary contribution should be abolished. We are encouraging parents to speak with school principals about their inability to make voluntary contributions but the very thought of doing so is petrifying to parents. It is very intimidating to have to meet the school principal to explain that one cannot afford a contribution. It could lead to parents not engaging with schools at all and avoiding going to parent-teacher meetings, school plays or award ceremonies or even allowing their children to participate in such activities because it might lead to bumping into the school principal they are supposed to meet to discuss why they cannot afford the voluntary contribution. That needs to be examined. What Mr. Robinson referred to is very worrisome. It should never be the case that a child is denied access to basic requirements such as lockers or school activities because he or she cannot afford the voluntary contribution. We should never let that happen. It needs to be stamped out immediately.  With regard to other issues such as the school uniform, to which Deputy Ó Laoghaire referred, what is the position in respect of the circular on cost-effective practice that was sent out in April 2017? What information has been gathered about how schools are implementing the circular? It should not be sporadic. Every single school should be implementing the measures called for in that circular.In response to Ms Stakem and the stories of struggle, I was particularly struck by the children in direct provision and their stories of struggle. How are they coping and how is information on access to grants being provided to their parents? Surely, children in direct provision should be getting extra support. If one in three of our homeless is a child and if more than 40% of our homeless are women, it strikes me that they need information on how to access support. What is happening to help our homeless and other people who are struggling get that support?  The cost of books is a significant burden. Ms Feely mentioned the provision of guidelines and support. What is the reason for the delay within the Department regarding the provision of updated guidelines and supports? Is she aware of the current position? Those guidelines should be given to schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am sorry for interrupting, but I was not asking for an oral report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. I was just referring to the struggles it faces. The State needs to give more support.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that happening? I was not condemning the society. It can only be commended on the work it does.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am not convinced that the guidelines released to the media yesterday ahead of this meeting will ensure the use of reduced timetables is the exception rather than the norm. I welcome the Minister's statement, but when one looks at it, one can see that it is seven pages long, with the issue of reduced timetables dealt with in three very small paragraphs on the last page. In the rest of it it seems that the Department is patting itself on the back, stating, "Aren't we great in the Department of Education and Skills.? This is what we are doing." However, it is not tackling the issue. On the form use, will the Minister consider requiring a school to document the other measures taken to deal with an issue before a child is placed on a reduced timetable? I know that the form asks for information on the support the school has sought, but it needs to outline exactly what has been done. Who has the right to say "No" or "Stop, we don't want this"? What happens when a parent says he or she does not want it to happen? What are the guidelines given to the school? What monitoring or reporting will take place during the time a child is placed on a reduced timetable? At the end of each plan, is there a requirement to notify all parties concerned of progress, regardless of whether it is being sought to renew it? Even renewing it is bizarre. Is there a requirement to report progress on how a reduced timetable is working?  According to the guidelines, the NCSE must be notified when a reduced timetable is agreed to for a student with special educational needs. Does the Minister intend to include or specify a further role or will it remain the case that the NCSE or the special educational needs organiser, SENO, must be notified and that is it, full stop? What is the role of the educational welfare officer or the SENO, particularly when it comes to renewals?  Regarding guideline K which stipulates a school must only consider an extension in exceptional circumstances and only with the further written consent of the parents, it should be made very clear in guideline A that the practice should only be considered in exceptional circumstances.There is a mention here of when a reduced timetable might be used, but I think it should start in the key requirements, stating that this is only to be used in a exceptional circumstances. That should be reiterated to the school if it is considering it. Would the Department consider making it a requirement not only to consult the parents or to get their written consent but also at least to have consultation with NEPS or another outside disability service provider relevant to the child in question? I am sure the witnesses read the Inclusion Ireland report, Education, Behaviour and Exclusion, in which it seeks that. I think it should be done. Does the Department intend to put a hard limit on the use of reduced timetables? Six weeks is given as a guideline and I think the word "ideally" is used. "Ideally" is not the word that should be used here because that leaves a lot of scope for abuse. I would prefer to see a hard limit. I think six weeks is an extraordinarily long time for a student be removed from school, to be on a reduced timetable, and to be isolated socially from his or her peers. Maybe the witnesses will look at that again. I notice on the information collected in the form - it may be an oversight - that there is no reference to gender. I see ethnicity but not gender. Is there a particular reason it has been left out? What assurances can we be given that the teachers placed with these students have been given the robust training that they need? It cannot be a case of a teacher drawing the short straw and being told he or she will have the students on the reduced timetable because he or she happens to be free. That is not fair to the students, to the parents or the teacher. It is a disservice to all involved. What guidance is given to the school about what subjects the students will have access to? When one starts probing into a reduced timetable, there are questions of what teachers will be qualified and what subjects will be taught. It is very problematic. Deputy Byrne referred to challenging behaviour. There is no definition of challenging behaviour and this is an ongoing issue across the world with departments of education. It leads to abuse of the term "challenging behaviour". There has to be training in challenging behaviour and resourcing of teachers, staff, schools and principals to address challenging behaviour. That means it is not child-centred, and instead of trying to support those children, they are just removed because of the so-called challenging behaviour that no one can define. Is the Department liaising with or does it intend to liaise with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, are properly resourced to provide the necessary assistance? What interdepartmental communication has taken place since we discussed this in Joint Committee on Education and Skills during the summer? We must make sure that at-risk children are given the appropriate help. I know that one recommendation in our interim report is that any guidelines relating to the use of reduced timetables must also outline the complaints process if a parent is dissatisfied. Parents must know how they can complain and the process must be in black and white. Where is that? The guidelines do not include that and I think that should be put in place. At the root of all this is the question of why schools are resorting to the use of reduced timetables, especially for children with disabilities. The Inclusion Ireland report stated that one in four children with a disability had been placed on a reduced timetable, with half of those being for more than 20 days. How can we ensure that every student with a disability or learning need has access to an appropriately trained teacher? How will schools be supported with these issues so they do not have to go to reduced timetables? If the Department is going to go ahead with these guidelines, which I have a problem with because I do not think they are rigid enough, could we have an annual report on the use of reduced timetables? Everyone could see every year the gender, socio-economic background, ethnicity, if there is a disability, and the length of reduced timetables. We need to see that every year. I have raised the issue of the inspectorate's critique every year since I was inspected. The inspectorate has to be asked to remove the question of why there are so many students with special educational needs as a critique of a school, whereas schools that do not have many students with special educational needs should be asked why and what they intend to do about it. That attitude needs to be changed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The last two replies are connected. What happens when a parent says "No"? The Minister said it would be a de facto suspension.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister also said they have recourse to section 29.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The next answer the Minister gave me is that it should not be used as a sanction. Surely a suspension is a sanction?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Then it is being used as a sanction, even though it should not be used as a sanction. How will the Minister address that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that an oversight?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It might be interesting when gathering the data to see whether it is young boys from a certain socio-economic background or if it is young girls.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I seek a further clarification, Chairman?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is fine. I was not sure if the Minister was talking about a capacity issue for an annual published report because I was about to say that has to be done and we need to be able to see that report. The form does not leave much room for detail. It asks whether a plan has been developed to support the student's return to full education and provides for a "Yes" or "No" answer. I would like to see the plan and Tusla should also see it. There is a lot of box-ticking and little detail available. We want this to be child centred.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Congratulations, comhghairdeas, on the participants' wonderful achievements at WorldSkills this year. I also commend the work of SOLAS, the HEA and the volunteers and WorldSkills Ireland on what they are doing for our youth. The participants should not underestimate the inspirational role models they are on that world stage for the youth of Ireland as they ponder their next careers. They are showing them the potential they have. Do the participants think their schools or career guidance counsellors give them enough encouragement to consider apprenticeships? What was their experience in secondary school and so on? Furthermore, I noticed that of the 17 participants, four were women. That is roughly the percentage of women we have in the Dáil, so we definitely need more women in the Dáil and more women apprentices. I, therefore, ask the following question of the women in particular, although I would like answers from some of the young men here as well. What has the women's experience been and what can we do to get more women involved in this? What do the men think we can do to get more women involved in apprenticeships? It is an untapped resource. There is such potential there.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the delegates for their presentations. As a former secondary school teacher, I am very interested in this issue. I worked in a DEIS school which offered a leaving certificate applied programme to children who were very suited to apprenticeships. Sometimes I believe the success that can lie ahead for those who pursue apprenticeships is not widely known and that that message is not being delivered. Instead of saying students can do this instead of going there, we need to tell them that there is a really successful path ahead for them if they pursue it. Encouragement is needed. My first question is for Mr. Brownlee and probably obvious, given that I am a Green Party Deputy. I am particularly aware of the need for an increase in the number of apprenticeships in retrofitting, energy efficiency measures and so on. There is a huge body of work to be done to bring our homes up to the standards required, make them warmer, healthier and improve our quality of life. As things stand, it is my understanding a lot of the training in retrofitting and renovation and acquiring energy efficiency skills happens outside Ireland. Last week I was chatting to a housing expert who emphasised two very interesting points about the lack of skills training in Ireland. He said that with the revisions to the leaving certificate construction studies course, many students on leaving school who had taken the course were particularly well equipped to deal with many of the newer, greener aspects of construction than people who had been working in the area for decades. He also said that, fundamentally, the big thing that was missing in incentivising students to pursue green skills apprenticeships was job certainty once they finished their studies. While I welcome the focus on sustainability across all aspects of apprenticeships, what actions can be taken in particular areas such as retrofitting and renovation to encourage more participation and a greater uptake? Currently, building standards are abysmal, under-regulated and under-inspected. There is a severe lack of trained professionals to do the work required. What supports are needed from across Government, not just from the Department of Education and Skills but also from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to ensure that we will be in a position to provide these skills and encourage people to pick them up? I was delighted to see an almost tenfold increase in the number of women taking up apprenticeships since 2016. It is fantastic to see that because we need to ensure diverse engagement with apprenticeship. I was here for the WorldSkills event a few weeks ago. The committee was delighted to see it. They are such fine young ambassadors and are so successful on that world stage for us. It is inspirational when they come here. I was fascinated by some of the roles. There was one young lady in freight forwarding and logistics. She mentioned that she would never have come across the role as a possible job if she had not accidentally stumbled across it. How do we highlight the broad range of apprenticeships that are available, particularly the more unusual ones? My next question is for both SOLAS and the IGC. The IGC emphasised the need to have contact with students earlier than during the second half of secondary school. Is there a value in having apprenticeship engagement in the earlier part of secondary school or even in primary school, not just with students but with parents? The stigma in this regard has to be broken down with parents as well. Should we be reaching into primary schools? In the context of the restoration of ex quota guidance provision, I witnessed the impact that had in our schools and have consistently called for it to be restored. On the WorldSkills event, for the IGC, they are such fine young ambassadors for our country and in motivating and encouraging people to pursue apprenticeships. How can we effectively deliver that information to the students in our schools? Anyone who heard their stories would consider pursuing it. What sort of engagement would be possible? It would be lovely to put them on a road show but they have their own jobs so it is hard to do that. It is even difficult to get them here for the committee for that one day. Is there some way of working with schools, for example through video presentations, or to have one of those brilliant young ambassadors mentoring a class or having engagement with classes? Is that being pursued? On the IGC and green apprenticeships, from the point of view of a guidance counsellor, how do we encourage more uptake of green skills? Are there any concrete plans or considerations given to how the IGC could engage with green apprenticeships?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I asked a question on the IGC's suggestion, with which I agree, that engagement needs to happen earlier than fifth year and in first, second and third year. Do our guests think we should actually be reaching into primary schools? Is there engagement on this with parents or students? How could it be done?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	We are now in public session. I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming. The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with stakeholders on the provisions of the Retention of Records Bill 2019. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne; Ms Eileen Molloy; Ms Mary Harney; Dr. Mary Lodato; Ms Catriona Crowe; Dr. Fred Logue of FP Logue Solicitors; Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, lecturer in human rights law at NUI Galway; and Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley, lecturer in history at NUI Galway. I will invite witnesses to make brief opening statements - a maximum of three minutes - that will be followed by an engagement with members. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne to make her opening statement. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the survivors for the honesty, courage and strength with which they speak for everyone for whom they speak. We have all been very moved, in particular, by Ms Harney's contribution when she said that their memories have been wiped and when she asked for them back. It was incredible. I cannot begin to understand what they have been through in terms of the abuse in residential institutions. At the beginning of the contributions, Dr. Lodato stated how she was proud to be a survivor. She spoke of the journey that she travelled to be proud to be a survivor and stated that she wants her full story in the National Archives. We must listen to survivors on that journey to healing. We have a role as a State to help them on that journey to healing. Ms McDonnell Byrne stated that it is important on their healing journey that they are empowered to make decisions and choices because that is something they were all denied as children. It is obvious that openness and transparency are essential parts of that healing. My question for Dr. Buckley is an expansion on what Senator Gallagher was asking. In some way, is this Bill about the Department of Education and Skills protecting itself? Will Dr. O'Rourke and Dr. Buckley expand or give us some details on how other jurisdictions that Dr. O'Rourke mentioned have dealt with this sensitive issue? Will Dr. Buckley take us through how it would be possible to categorise different types of records appropriately or how they could be appropriately anonymised or redacted, if that was needed?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. Kane for coming in and for the work he is doing in a voluntary capacity in chairing the oversight group. Like other members, I had concerns about the overlap when this committee was set up. My concerns remain today and may be even greater. Does Mr. Kane share them? We could say that he is looking at the successor policy, what needs to be done, and that our role may be implementation. However, it is here in black and white that the successor policy to A Vision for Change will include a multi-annual implementation plan. Therefore that is not something we should be doing. How does Mr. Kane envisage us working in tandem? On the membership of the oversight group, following on from the remarks of Deputies Harty and Brassil on over-medication, is there any intention for the oversight group to examine mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or stress reduction? I would agree with the Chair about having a general practitioner in the oversight group. Would Mr. Kane consider also including an expert in the field of mindfulness or resilience building? These areas came up in our education committee, which produced a document recently on positive mental health in schools. I agree with other members of the committee on the funding issue. I would ask Mr. Kane to flag it and that it be looked at. It has been an issue with A Vision for Change, even as recently as last week in the budget. We have this great plan but the funding is not delivered to match it. That is a major problem when it comes to implementation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The witness said the HSE had invested significantly. Could I have that figure? Can the witnesses provide a breakdown of expenditure on out-of-area placements and agency staff in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 please? Can I have a breakdown of last year's mental health expenditure in CAMHS, general health and old age psychiatry by community health care organisation? If there is no time to answer all these questions, I would like the answers in written form.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the division please provide a breakdown for the 2018 mental health budget, including the 2018 development funding? Will the witnesses let me know how and why these areas were identified for investment? The 2017 HSE mental health operation plan commits to reviewing existing out-of-hours services, exploring ways to improve 24-7 crisis intervention arrangements and considering pilot sites. It makes commitments on the development of out-of-hours mental health supports being included in the HSE mental health operation plans since 2014. In February of this year, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Helen McEntee, publicly stated that work was under way on a roadmap for the development of out-of-hours access to mental health services. Has the HSE completed this work? When did the HSE complete the work? When will the roadmap be published? Has a budget been identified for its implementation? Has any funding been allocated to the exploration and design of evidence-based psychological resilience building programmes in our schools, even on a pilot basis? There is extensive research from other countries showing that certain strategies taught in schools can leave children less vulnerable to mental illness. This is not to take away from the well-being policy being implemented in the new junior certificate. Are we being specific about psychological interventions based on psychological research, which indicates that early intervention is key? Has any consideration been given by the HSE to establishing a team of appropriately trained psychotherapists or psychologists dedicated specifically to schools? There are some teachers who are trained as psychotherapists. NEPS is under-resourced and such a team would take the pressure off it. Has any research been done on this by the division? Has a budget been identified to implement this?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In that case, if my last question is being moved to next week, I will ask a different question on funding. Could I have a breakdown of expenditure in the following areas in the past three years: mental health and intellectual disability, dual diagnosis of addiction and mental health difficulties, mental health services for people experiencing homelessness, and mental health services for minority groups?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am also concerned with working towards a national view. We need a national view. What exactly does Ms O'Connor mean when she says the HSE is working towards the national view? It worries me that the witnesses are saying that services within schools are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills because there is a huge problem with the lack of joined-up thinking. There is a need for Departments to communicate and link up with each other. One cannot say that the issue of children suffering with mental health issues belongs in one box, which is the Department of Education and Skills, and that the HSE can take a hands-off approach. It is not acceptable. The HSE must take responsibility for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is also the question of agency staff from 2013 to 2017.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is there a timeframe for the breakdown the witnesses are going to provide to us? Will we have it for next week? Will it include mental health and intellectual disability dual diagnosis, homeless and minority groups? The witness has said that information is not readily available today, which beggars belief. With respect, when they were coming in to this committee dealing with funding, did the witnesses not foresee that we might want that information? Surely this is not the first time this information has been sought. I would say practically every member here has submitted parliamentary questions and written to the HSE. I really am struggling with how the witnesses were not ready for that today. Even in this Dáil, have the two Ministers of State who have held responsibility for mental health sought that breakdown from the HSE at any stage? Have they asked where that money is being spent and how?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are all aware of the difficulties in recruiting people into the public services. However, the facts and figures presented by Mr. Hughes are of extreme concern. We could hear a pin drop we were all so taken aback. The word demoralising has been used but I would suspect it is heartbreaking for health professionals to work in a situation where they are reduced to saying that a chair is a bed. They are highly trained professionals. If we look at 34% being eligible for retirement in five years, we are facing a mental health time bomb. I refer to 500 vacancies in psychiatric nursing and 1,343 trained nurses and midwives having sought certificates of current professional status because they are going to go overseas. It is incredible. However, if people are working in a system with low pay, appalling working conditions and they are undervalued, why would they stay? They are so valued abroad.  It is obvious that the issue of pay and conditions needs to be addressed and quickly. Do the members of the PNA reference any other barriers or disincentives? I refer to people in Waterford being told that parental or annual leave may have to be suspended. Are career progression, cost of living and work life balance issues that come up? What can be done to address those issues? What services and supports are in place for our mental health professionals? I refer to the stress they face in their working conditions and the burnout they may feel.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I also want the letter to include a request for supports to be provided to staff who suffer from stress or burnout.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is it that they are supposed to get it and do not get it or is it that they are not even assigned that time?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	GPs are the first port of call for patients. The ICGP was before us prior to Christmas and it said the crisis in the Irish mental health care service is also a crisis in general practice. Do the witnesses agree with that? There is constant talk of the need to build up our primary care services but I do not understand how our GPs are going to have the capacity to protect or care for patients who present with mental health difficulties. It was said that GPs aged over 60 now accounted for 30% of the workforce and we do not know if these will be replaced. Before Christmas, we were told there were only 37 GPs in Kilkenny, 38 in Longford and 41 in Kildare and that last year was the first year ever that ten places on the GP training scheme were not filled. We need them but we cannot recruit them, never mind retain them, so what is the solution?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Chair. I will ask my questions quickly in order that the witnesses have time to respond. I thank them for their presentations and commend them on the valuable work they do. I offer Dylan my congratulations on his recent success in the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. As the Chair stated, we have heard further regrettable evidence of how the poor and marginalised are last in the queue for crucial services, which is shameful for us as a country. My first questions are to Mr. Rojas Coppari or Ms Rashmi. A Vision For Change states that no one can achieve true mental heath recovery without having a meaning to life and access to employment. What has been the toll or impact of the years that so many in direct provision centres have been deprived of the right to work and the dignity of earning an independent income? Has there been an increase in mental illness among those who have been deprived of that right or are there any data in that regard? Those who have managed to make their way from war-torn countries are highly likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Are any mental health providers given specific treatment to support such people or specific training to support victims of human trafficking? What is being done in regard to language barriers? There have been reports of children interpreting for migrant parents who present for medical attention. Is that happening in respect of mental health services? If so, that is highly inappropriate and would cause huge stress for the child and for the parent who requires the child to interpret. Does Mr. Coppari or Mr. Reilly know if training workshops are available for psychologists and psychotherapists to acquaint them with the unique and intrinsic cultures of minority groups whose members may seek therapy? What culturally inclusive training is being delivered to mental health providers? The 2012 HSE intercultural strategy stated the need for an ethnic identifier for service users, but Mr. Reilly in his submission highlighted that is still not standard, which I presume makes managing or determining outcomes very difficult. Without knowing those outcomes, how difficult is it to tailor supports for people from the Traveller community or minority backgrounds and to ensure that staff are trained to meet their specific needs? What funding is allocated to mental health supports for the Traveller community, migrant groups and LGBTI groups on an annual basis? Do we have data outlining the exact funding in that regard? I recently spoke to Ms Geraldine Dunne, the managing director of Southside Travellers Action Group in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, to ask her about the needs of the community in that area. She mentioned the lack of supports for teenagers and youths, which, unsurprisingly and regrettably, is an issue of huge concern. In the opinion of Mr. Reilly or Ms Quirke, how could that best be addressed?I do not understand why a representative of the Traveller community was not on the youth mental health task force. The witness said that this was sought on several occasions. Therefore, what reason was given? It beggars belief. I do not understand why there was no representative and would like to know the exact reason given. How was that explained? Many of my questions arise from Dylan's and Ms Griffith's project. As a former teacher, I am wondering what training for teachers is in place with regard to gender and LGBTI sensitivities. Dylan's project refers to a number of surveys but one shows that 20% of the 277 people surveyed stated that their teachers did not use the correct name or pronoun. Was that a case of the teacher choosing not to use it? Was it that the teacher said that he or she would not use the preferred pronoun? If so, it needs to be addressed. Have the witnesses any ideas on how it can be addressed? It is not acceptable. Has BelongTo approached the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals on how schools can develop policies relating to LGBTI students for staff? What has been the response? Is anything being developed? Am I doing okay with the clock?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Therefore, it is the luck of the draw. One might arrive at a person who has had the training.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is key because I was fearful it was a choice not to do so, but Dylan believes it is a lack of understanding and that is why training is needed for staff.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not know where to start. I thank the delegates for attending.  Table 3 screams at me, as I am sure it does for everyone. As Mr. Condon stated, ten of the 16 posts are in child and adolescent psychiatry in places such as Cork, Sligo-Leitrim, Carlow-Kilkenny, Donegal and Longford-Westmeath. We are failing the children affected and their families. Everyone agrees that there is a problem in recruitment and retention and that the HSE has recognised the deficits, but who should the committee invite in order that we can tell them that not enough is being done and to, please, do more for the families affected? It is not good enough. What can be done to accelerate the lengthy recruitment process? The CAAC meets ten times a year. Mr. Condon stated he would sign approvals within 72 hours but that he would then have to wait for the CAAC to meet, which could take one month.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is there anything we can do about that process of waiting for CAAC to meet? Does it need to meet more than ten times a year? Would that speed up the process? I see that psychiatry has one of the highest percentages of non-permanent consultant posts, at 20%. Why is this? What differentiates mental health from other branches of medicine? Professor Frank Keane's report mentioned that a contributing factor to the crisis was the way the jobs were advertised. Has the job description improved? With this timeline of recruitment, there seem to be delays at each stage. It is the most complicated process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is like a roller-coaster. We are brought back to where we started. How does that compare to international best practice?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Professor Murray agrees and has said before that it may need to be reviewed. What is frustrating is that it seems to take coming into this meeting to see that it needs to be reviewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Has Professor Murray started the review on this?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When will that conclude? Is there a timeline?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Deputy Buckley raised the retirements that are coming down the line and Professor Murray said we can do better in anticipating retirement and that we should probably ask people if they are considering retiring or to give a year's notice. I cannot believe we are not doing that already. It is not rocket science, with all respect. It is an unnecessary failing that can be avoided.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. Sullivan for his attendance and presentation. With the greatest respect, I think I speak for many members when I express my disappointment and frustration. I understand that Mr. Sullivan was invited to this committee on 17 April and we received a submission yesterday, less than 24 hours before the meeting. Before my election to the Oireachtas, I ran a student council with second level students and they knew that the agenda and submissions to the meeting came in a week earlier, and they were children aged 12 to 18 years. That is deeply frustrating. I was watching out for the submission over the last five days as I wanted to study it and I do not think the three-page document that we received is good enough. Within the three pages, as Deputy Rabbitte has noted, there is nothing into which one can sink one's teeth. There are phrases such as "maintain stability during the transition" and it tells us that over 90% of mental health needs can be successfully treated in primary care, when from previous meetings we know that we only have 37 general practitioners in Kilkenny, 41 in Kildare, 38 and Longford and there is a crisis in this area. I do not think that it is acceptable. Given previous evidence that dedicated resources are needed within mental health to drive forward policy, will Mr. Sullivan explain why the decision has been taken to remove the national director for mental health? In his submission, Mr. Sullivan pointed to an increase of 22% in mental health expenditure since 2013. That read to me like the kind of answer the Minister would give to me in response to a parliamentary question or something I would see in a Government party manifesto. Where is that money going? Over the course of this committee's work, we have heard of the huge numbers of staffing positions being unfilled, how people remain on practically indefinite waiting lists and it was reported yesterday that in just one month, there was a 10% increase of young people waiting for services for over a year. If there has been an increase in funding over five years, I would like to know where it is going and, more importantly, the reason it is not being felt by service users. Mr. Sullivan stated there have been tangible results from the increased spending. What are they? Who will have the authority to set priorities for the mental health expenditure across the country?  How will the structural changes address the issues in recruitment, retention and pay as well as the lack of resources and poor working conditions? It is no good saying that we have increased spending and changed HSE structures when we do not have the front-line staff to provide care. Who in the HSE will provide the dedicated leadership on delivering and improving mental health services? Mr. Sullivan stated that the "changes now being implemented within the HSE are designed to build on successes to date". Will he list some of those successes? We have 2,500 children waiting for a first mental health appointment. The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, continue to operate at just 50% of recommended staffing levels. A recent report found that some third level institutions have indicated a 41% increase in students seeking counselling over the past three years. There is now a six-month waiting list for counselling services in many institutions. When he speaks of successes to date, Mr. Sullivan will find many service users are not experiencing successes. Last year, the Sláintecare report recommended that 10% of the overall health budget be spent on mental health, the 12 year old A Vision for Change document recommended 8.24%, yet currently we are at 6%. Is 10% achievable? When can we reach 10%. Should we aim higher? What will the HSE do to secure this budgetary allocation? Whose responsibility is it to get us up to best practice standards of 10%?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It was my understanding when A Vision for Change was launched, that it recommended the establishment of a directorate for mental health. In 2008 a report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services voiced strong concern about the lack of a separate mental health services directorate. Does that mean that some evidence has been gathered that we do not need it because it was welcomed when it was established? What is the rationale for taking it away?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The HSE did not understand the needs of patients, but it will now have a better understanding because of this structure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is there an intention to review the structure within a year to see whether it is working and improving?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the findings of any such review be published?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations and all the invaluable work they do to advocate for our most vulnerable citizens. We share Dr. Muldoon's concerns about the lack of clarity and transparency when it comes to where the money is being spent. This committee has been hitting a brick wall for the past few months. In particular, I thank Ms Brennan. She was very courageous and I know she did that for her own child and the children in her own area and our country. I know how difficult that was for her and we really appreciate it. She hit the nail on the head. Fundamentally, it is a crucial test for society via politics and we are failing miserably. In the new politics that we talk about, mental health support should be top of the agenda. Many of the questions I was going to ask about the Mental Health Commission have already been answered. Do we have any idea about the number of unregulated mental health care services outside approved centres or where they are located? What happens when they come to the attention of the commission? Do we have any statistics in this area?  I will concentrate on education because that is my background. I was interested in Dr. Muldoon's recommendation for school-based counselling. It is something I would be keen to see. I know it is the norm in many countries so how can we do this? Does Dr. Muldoon believe that the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health are working together properly to address supports for our children? Is that interdepartmental collaboration close enough? Are the Departments working together in innovative ways to support them? Is the promotion of happiness and mental resilience among our children being addressed at all? In a recent survey, the majority of primary school principals said that they just do not know. Children are really stressed out and more anxious than ever before and principals do not know how to cope with it and how to help these children. Is that interdepartmental approach there?  There was a reference to some teachers doing some work. It is quite sporadic. What needs to be done there to ensure that it is not so sporadic and that we have the proper training for teachers before we reach the stage where we get those counsellors on site? What is the obstacle there because it cannot be sporadic and down to a post code? A lot of the time, children in the most vulnerable postcodes are being let down so what can be done to ensure it is done across the board? 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I sit on the education committee, which prepared a report on promoting positive mental health. Within that, apart from looking after our children, it was referenced by the experts that, despite the need for teachers to be fully there to support their students, the mental health of teachers is often forgotten about. Is that something we can work on here?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentations. I will get straight into it as I want to ask as many questions as possible. There are 179 whole-time equivalent posts in NEPS. If there are 3,000 primary schools and more than 700 post-primary schools, it seems this would be an incredible workload. How does that compare with other jurisdictions with education psychologists? Ms Tansey indicated that 179 NEPS psychologists dealt with 8,309 children, which is an incredible workload. Ms Lorraine Dempsey of the Special Needs Parents Association was yesterday before the education committee of which I am a member. She was critical of the insufficient number of education psychologists available. I am just curious about how we compare with other jurisdictions. What is the maximum and minimum number of schools assigned to a NEPS psychologist? Is there a cut-off point? The Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 indicated that 65 psychologists would be recruited in the first quarter of 2017, with the aim of bringing the total to 238. Since 2016, a total of 16 whole-time positions have been recruited when resignations and retirements are taken into account. The 2018 plan has a target for ten to be recruited, which would bring the total to 189. Where do the other posts come from? Will Ms Tansey outline the recruitment process for a NEPS psychologist? Is it time consuming? How many are there to be recruited? She mentioned the intention to recruit 15 psychologists this year. On 12 June, In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister indicated the intention was to recruit ten psychologists.  Ms Tansey mentioned that NEPS psychologists do not generally use talk therapy. Does that mean some do and some do not? Is talk therapy valued and should it be introduced to assist students? Is there a plan to introduce it via NEPS or are the qualifications not there? I am wondering what are the obstacles. The Irish Council for Psychotherapy mentioned the snapshot of the national experience. It did not look good in any way. One person in particular was accepted for interview, placed on a panel but received no further contact. Do we know how long this person was waiting or is the person still waiting? Is this reflective of a wider experience? Do many people face such significant delays between the interview and hiring? What effect does it have on staffing if a person is put on a panel but never hears from anyone else again? What are the dangers for our most vulnerable people of not having proper regulation for psychotherapists and counsellors? Are they being exploited, even in a financial sense? Ms O'Flaherty referred to a framework document in which there is a breakdown of several key health areas, such as weight, smoking, alcohol and well-being. Each is broken down under headings that include a Healthy Ireland indicator description, baseline indicators, targets or sources for development of potential indicators. Of the seven health areas listed, well-being is the only one that has no targets or sources for development of potential indicators. Why is that the case? I fully agree with Dr. Barry that we are not doing enough with the toolbox of skills to cope in a time of crisis. It is something we dealt with on the education committee. There was mention of emotional resilience skills for children so how could they be realised best in schools? Would it be a whole-school approach or should there be specific teachers? Do we need to put this on the teacher training course? There is anxiety in young students. Should we introduce mindfulness and how could it be done? Should we be careful that a teacher, even with the best intentions, could do something dangerous? What training exists? I presume the resilience and mindfulness education would start from primary school.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is Ms Tansey confident of getting to 238 by 2021?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome and thank both Ministers for coming in today. On the 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists who have recently been appointed, will the Minister outline how was that achieved and the recruitment process from advertisement to appointment? It seems it was a success. Last month, Professor Frank Murray, director of the national doctors training and planning division of the HSE, presented to the committee a table of 16 mental health consultant posts advertised in 2016 for which no applications were received. Unfortunately, ten of the posts were for paediatric consultants. To see that in black and white was frightening for all of us. What has been learned from this that enabled the Department to hire 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists in a year? How was that done? How can that success story be transferred to other Departments in similar need? What consultation has taken place between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills? Deputy O'Loughlin is the Chair of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, of which I am a member, as was the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, when we drew up our report on positive mental health in schools. Has the Minister seen the report's key recommendations? I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has seen them. I read with interest during the week about a new initiative on extra suicide prevention training planned for teachers under which two relevant members of school staff will be trained in suicide prevention. In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, will provide training for crisis scenarios. Representatives of NEPS appeared before the committee a few weeks ago, and the organisation is on its knees. We have fewer than 200 NEPS psychologists to serve all of our primary and post-primary schools. I do not know where the time will be found to train teachers. It is my understanding that if a NEPS psychologist goes out on maternity leave, no cover is provided. That needs to be addressed. It is a shame the approach being pursued by the Department of Education and Skills - I wonder again about the consultation - does not reflect the report's key recommendations. One wonders why that report and research were done. There are some fantastic recommendations, including on the provision of psychotherapy training and other professional development for the counsellors who are already in our schools. It is worth reading and a shame it was not followed through. Representatives of Pavee Point appeared before the committee in February. It is regrettable that the organisation was not invited to participate in the national task force on mental health, even though it requested to be included. I do not understand why it was not included, especially in light of its request. I do not know if it even received a reply. It was an appalling lack of consultation. I appeal to the Minister to ensure engagement with the Traveller community is not only with focus groups but is real, meaningful consultation. It was left out of the discussion, which is wrong. Why was it left out?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a follow-up to the question I asked about the 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has agreed to give me information on the recruitment process-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----but he referred to some already being in the system. Of the 114 assistant psychologists and the 20 psychologists, how many of them are new and were not in the system already? Otherwise, with the greatest respect, it is a form of massaging of numbers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister of State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I apologise for being late to the meeting and if I repeat any question already asked. I share colleagues' concerns about the huge percentage of homes that will go to private provision. If we are talking about using public land for housing, it does not stack up if we are taking 100% of it and giving 60% away to private ownership. I am concerned about that type of developer-led housing. These legislative proposals give the Land Development Agency considerable power by way of its mandate to undertake national large-scale procurement of housing. In his opening statement Mr. Coleman referred to building a new organisation. What categories of expertise have been retained directly for this purpose? Mr. Coleman might not be able to provide the information today, but I would like to know the numbers of architects, quantity surveyors, project managers and procurement professionals who will be directly employed by the LDA to carry out this enormous undertaking of acquiring, developing and maintaining the lands over time. I presume the LDA will develop a policy to govern the specifics of how the cost rental model will work and how management systems for those developments will operate. Will that policy be available for review by the Oireachtas before the Bill completes its passage through the Houses? It is important that we see it before the legislation is enacted. The LDA is beginning its work during a declared national climate emergency. What steps will it take to ensure its developments promote and employ the most innovative and low carbon construction methods and have the lowest carbon footprint and life-cycle running costs possible? This is particularly important, given the tenants' exposure to maintenance costs over time. Does the agency have a climate action policy that will inform its work? Does the Bill, as proposed, allow the Minister to sell his or her shareholding in the agency? That is an obvious concern, given the large amounts of public land the LDA is seeking to assemble. If there is such a provision, why is it necessary to include that power in the Bill? People in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown have concerns about the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum. What level of public consultation is planned on that development and when will it take place? The complete dominance of build-to-rent housing in the area is locking people out of affordability to purchase homes in the places in which they were born and raised.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will we see it before the Bill is concluded? It would be good for the Oireachtas to see exactly how the cost rental model-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is no actual climate action policy for each-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a nightmare.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I asked a question about the different categories of expertise available. Would it be possible to have the numbers forwarded to us?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That would be appreciated.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have met many people about this matter. In early 2017, people in the Beacon South Quarter in my constituency brought this to my attention and I have been working with them. Since then, many other developments in Dublin Rathdown have made it public but I am aware of others that have not made it public because they are afraid to. I welcome the formation of the Construction Defects Alliance and commend those in the Beacon South Quarter who helped to drive it, as outlined by Ms Cottier. We would not tolerate this sort of public safety issue in the food industry or on the roads and I do not know why we tolerate it in our homes. Surely it should be of paramount importance that people feel safe in their homes. That is not happening. The Green Party passed a motion with unanimous support in the Dáil in 2017 calling for an independent regulator and redress scheme. That was followed by amazing work in this committee to produce the Safe as Houses? report, yet we are in November 2019 and we are no further along. I am truly worried that a tragedy will have to occur before Government pays attention to this shameful legacy. Mr. Prior is a homeowner. Will he elaborate on his own experience of finding out that there were defects? How does he and the people he knows feel about living in that place? Who does he turn to for advice when he hears this? There is not even a helpline. I always feel that homeowners are abandoned there. There is no helpline, so who do they turn to for legal advice? Does Mr. Prior know what sacrifices are being made by homeowners who are paying the levy to come up with the money? Are people borrowing, going without medical care, pension contributions or school fees? What legal pressure is there on people who simply cannot pay? Do threatening letters come in? I would like to recognise the bravery shown by many homeowners such as Mr. Prior, those in the Gallery and others who have come forward and even stood at the gates of Leinster House to campaign for the Government to act. It is to be hoped that will lead to more happening. Does Mr. Prior feel that the invisibility of people who are not coming forward is playing into the Government's hands? If it does not see large numbers, does it feel that it can leave this to one side? Does Mr. Prior feel that that is a factor? How does he feel when the Taoiseach and Ministers stand up in the Dáil, as they have done many times, and say that it is a private contractual issue? How does he feel about the announcements of the mica redress scheme and the pyrite redress scheme, with nothing for him? How widespread a problem does he think the construction defects are throughout the country and does he hear of many? I hear of many defects. Homeowners and prospective homeowners are still expected to put their faith in builders who are really self-regulating, even since 2014. Should there be an independent regulator? People simply do not trust builders to self-regulate. The Government has a duty to protect homeowners and prospective homeowners against greed-driven building standards and incompetent rogue cowboy builders. I am not saying that all builders are rogue or incompetent, but a number of builders and developers have done an extraordinary disservice to the many decent, hard-working people in the industry. The tragic inferno at Grenfell is a stark reminder of the overriding principle of the safety of residents. In the rush to build the houses that are so urgently needed, I believe that all houses and apartments must be built to an acceptable, safe standard. What measures would the witnesses like the Government to take to tackle the issue? Will the Apartment Owners' Network elaborate on its pre-budget submissions about the tax relief that could be used to assist homeowners? What would the witnesses say to any person who is currently dealing with a defect in his or her home?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On this issue, I met the Minister of State, Deputy English, well over a year ago to discuss the Beacon South Quarter. It was agreed at that meeting that he would meet with Beacon South Quarter representatives. I emphasise that both the Department and the Ministers need to engage with this issue, in order that they can see the real life experiences and stress involved. I pointed out to the Minister of State at the time that he had met with people in Donegal about mica issues a few months before that, so there was precedent for such a meeting. About a week later he wrote back and said he had changed his mind and would not be engaging with those representatives.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an cuireadh teacht anseo inniu. Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith anseo chun labhairt faoi tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne agus ár bhfreagra ar an bpaindéim Covid. I intend to address the committee on matters relating to tourism, culture, arts and media while my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will address matters related to sport and the Gaeltacht. The sectors under the aegis of my Department are among the most severely impacted by the global pandemic and associated public health measures. Unfortunately, as the pandemic continues, we are likely to continue to experience these significant and negative impacts.As such, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee on the important challenges facing our sectors and to open a dialogue on the strategic priorities for the Department as we turn our faces to the future and to recovery.  Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are integral parts of the fabric of our society and our democracy, supporting a wide range of economic activity as well enhancing our physical, mental and societal well-being. Central to the operation of these sectors is the coming together of people, whether to enjoy a cultural event, watch a match or enjoy a meal or night out. The combined portfolio of tourism, culture, the arts, the Gaeltacht, sport and media speaks to who we are as a nation and how we identify ourselves.  The Covid-19 crisis has challenged all of our core presumptions and values and made us reflect critically on the importance of these sectors to our nation. It is no longer possible for us to come together for a cultural, sporting or social event. The flow of visitors we normally welcome from Europe, the US and beyond is not with us. More than ever, we require high-quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content. Our focus has been on the collective effort to protect the vulnerable in our society, on keeping our health and social care services operating and on preventing further disruption to childcare and education. All of this also reflects who we are as a people, a society which cares about its most vulnerable, and we should never lose sight of this. It has come at an enormous cost for the sectors for which I and the Minister of State have responsibility.  I will take a moment to set out the impacts of the pandemic. There has been a collapse in international tourism which the OECD estimates will be to the order of 80%. We have experienced the loss of all overseas tourism since March. The impact of social distancing measures and the limits on gatherings required to protect public health have also significantly diminished the domestic tourism and hospitality sectors. Fáilte Ireland estimates that some 40% of tourism businesses have not reopened since the first lockdown in 2020.  Cultural venues and events were among the first to be closed in our response to the pandemic and will undoubtedly be among the last to reopen. This continues to have a devastating impact on performance opportunities, displays, festivals and concerts, impacting on our opportunities to experience culture and performance as well as employment and economic activity in the sector. The impact of the pandemic on the arts sector extends well beyond artists. It has also affected crews and the wide range of people it takes to put on live performances in venues and at festivals.  Sport, which is central to the lives of many people in Ireland, has been similarly impacted with restrictions on spectators, and curtailed activity generally, severely impacting on revenues. The commercial sports and leisure sector has also seen its activity cease as we moved to level 5 of the Government’s plan for living with Covid-19.  Across the Gaeltacht, businesses and communities alike have suffered a significant reduction in economic activity, tourism and educational visitors as a consequence of Covid-19. Many are now facing the double impact of Brexit. I am very conscious that this will pose a further risk for the language as it may result in more native speakers leaving our Gaeltacht regions.  The media sector, which has played such a critical role in supporting and disseminating public messaging about the Covid-19 response, has been especially hard hit by reduced advertising revenues. It is ironic that this has come at a time when there has never been a greater need for trusted news sources.  Over recent months, I have been working with Government colleagues to ensure that we are addressing the crisis in our sectors head on and sustaining, protecting and enhancing resilience where we can. Across government, we continue to invest heavily in protecting incomes through the pandemic unemployment payment, in protecting livelihoods through the employment wage subsidy scheme and, most recently in the budget, in protecting businesses through the Covid restrictions support scheme. Given the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on our sectors, these universal supports continue to form a critical part of our response. The VAT cut, the tax debt warehousing extension and the rates waiver are also essential in helping sustain businesses across our sectors.  Engaging with our sectoral stakeholders has been an essential part of our response to the pandemic and it is critical that we, as policymakers, listen closely to the voices and experiences of artists, cultural workers, tourism businesses, sporting bodies, the media and our Gaeltacht communities.Task forces made up of sectoral experts have been set up to direct our responses and set us on the path of recovery for the tourism and arts and culture sectors. Informed by these engagements, I have introduced a range of sector-specific measures. While it is not possible to go through them all in detail in this opening statement, I will highlight a number of very significant support measures. The Arts Council has seen its funding allocation increase by €25 million over its initial budget allocation in 2020 and has been allocated a total funding provision of €130 million under budget 2021. This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations get through the crisis and ensures that they will still be there to play their part in the national recovery. This funding will help protect jobs and livelihoods, while also supporting thousands of artists in creating new work during and after the pandemic. It will focus on enhancing the resilience of the sector, while also looking to find new ways of reaching audiences in person and online. Live entertainment has also been significantly impacted by the pandemic, as attendance at concerts, festivals and events is either severely curtailed or no longer permitted under the five levels. To that end, I am providing €50 million in funding to support live entertainment in 2021, which will include significant support measures for the commercial entertainment sector. A key pillar of this support package is the extension of the pilot live performance support scheme from the 2020 July stimulus, which will incentivise venues, producers and promoters of live performances to plan new productions and to employ workers in the cultural and creative sectors. Earlier this week, I announced the outcome of the pilot which aims to see up to 58 performances being staged over the coming months, providing much-needed work for artists, entertainers and those who work in the sector. We are also working with our national cultural Institutions and cultural spaces across the country to ensure they can operate safely under the Government's plan for living with Covid-19. These spaces and their collections are vital for the well-being of our communities. The work of curators and cultural practitioners in bringing them to life online over the pandemic has been truly exceptional. For tourism, my immediate focus is on helping the sector to survive the Covid crisis and the recovery plan produced by the tourism recovery task force is a valuable contribution to my thinking in this context. In response to the recommendations, I strongly advocated for additional supports as part of budget 2021 and was pleased to support the Government's announcement of a new €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector. These measures will complement the EWSS and CRSS and the restart scheme. The Government has also responded to the call from the industry and reduced the VAT rate in the sector to 9%, which will enhance viability and competitiveness. While it may take a while for the benefits of the VAT cut and the stay-and-spend tax credit to be felt, they will be important supports when we open up again. All of the budgetary measures will build on the €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector and the €10 million supports for international coach tourism announced in July. Throughout the crisis, my Department has worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and media stakeholders to assess the impact of the crisis on the sector. To mitigate some of the worst effects, the BAI agreed to waive its broadcasting levy for the first half of the year for the independent radio sector and I have secured additional funding to offset this. More significantly, and in recognition of the importance of the public, commercial and community media in disseminating public health messages, additional funding has been provided for the sound and vision scheme, with an additional round valued at €2.5 million for commercial radio, a €750,000 round, and the current round that will distribute €4.5 million to the audiovisual sector, boosted by an additional €2 million in Exchequer funding under the July stimulus package. Well-being is a core principle underpinning the living with Covid-19 plan, and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term. Well-being is also at the heart of our programme for Government and is a central pillar to my Department's policies, with the arts and culture, sport, the Irish language, the media and tourism all contributing to our national and individual well-being. From that perspective, I consider it vital that we lift our heads and proactively plan for recovery, a recovery which will come and for which I want these sectors to be in the best position they can be to resume activity. For tourism, my overall objective is to facilitate recovery and future growth that is sustainable from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Central to this will be a three-year survival, stabilisation and recovery programme based on the recommendations of the tourism recovery task force.Additionally, I intend to initiate the development of an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable tourism policy that will further set our direction over the coming years. We will continue to develop our national tourism product, including through strategic investments under the national development plan and for activity-based tourism, being conscious of the ancillary economic benefits from such investments in often isolated locations.  The arts and culture task force has also set the direction for recovery in that broad sector. The task force has completed its deliberations and I intend to bring its final report to the attention of Government at the earliest opportunity. I will work closely with sectoral stakeholders and colleagues in government on the implementation of its recommendations.  There are strong links between commercial and State-supported cultural activity with artists and other cultural workers often moving between both during their careers. As such, ensuring we continue to support our cultural workers ensures a vibrant commercial sector in the future. The Arts Council, which, as I mentioned earlier, has received significant additional funding for 2021, will also play a central role in ensuring that artists and arts workers will get through the crisis, will continue to create and will be in a position to return to live performance when we are again able to gather together.  An allocation of €8 million has also been made to the National Concert Hall, NCH, for 2021 to allow for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra from RTÉ. This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling it to be established as a world-class orchestra which will, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. Our work with the live entertainment sector is also turning towards the future, and I intend to support the development of guidance for venues in how to manage the return to live performances as well as the bespoke funding scheme announced in budget 2021. The work of the night-time economy task force, due to report at the end of the year, will create a renewed vision for night-time culture, informed by the experience of the crisis but also providing a long-term perspective on what our cities and towns should offer their citizens and visitors in terms of cultural and entertainment options. Creativity and resilience often go hand in hand and, under the Creative Ireland programme, my Department has invested significant additional funding of €3.9 million to support artistic and creative operators to produce creative content and deliver creative initiatives. More broadly, new funding has also been directed towards the creative sector in support of public resilience and well-being initiatives. For example, the rapid roll-out of the creativity in older age scheme in July has seen the deployment by national organisations and local authorities of a series of projects worth more than €500,000 by creative practitioners, supporting older people in community and healthcare settings nationwide.  The Creative Ireland programme is also currently working closely to support Healthy Ireland on the Government’s recently launched community resilience campaign, Keep Well. This will see significant additional funding provided by Government to local authorities to support creative operators in delivering a range of initiatives to support individual and community creativity in the arts, culture and heritage. My Department is also working to enhance resilience and support the creative industries, including the audiovisual sector. We will continue to implement the audiovisual action plan over the coming years, as well as supporting Screen Ireland and its subsidiary, Screen Skills Ireland, to build and support a world-class industry in Ireland.  In terms of media, I was pleased to provide additional funding to TG4 in 2020 and 2021, as well as providing additional funding of €2 million for the sound and vision scheme in 2020. These initiatives are helping to build quality output for TV audiences in Ireland and beyond, as well as critically supporting the independent production sector. As I mentioned earlier, we were also in a position to support the broader media sector through various BAI measures, including the initial waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector. While addressing the immediate needs of the sector, there is important work to be done on addressing the future of media in this country. The Future of Media Commission has been established and held its inaugural meeting last week. This commission will, through engagement with key stakeholders, help inform future media policy. I will also be actively engaged in ensuring the safe passage of the online safety and media regulation Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming months.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting these sectors as they navigate through the unique and difficult challenges the Covid-19 crisis presents. I will continue to do everything possible to ensure they remain viable through the crisis and resilient in recovery and to seek out new opportunities and a longer-term vision so that they can thrive once again when this crisis passes. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak to the Irish language and sport.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I am glad that the live performance support scheme has been well received. It is a pilot scheme of €5 million, with €50 million to be launched to help next year. On the Deputy's query about the CRSS, which falls under the remit of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and those who do not have fixed premises, the live performance support scheme was designed to bring them in. The scheme is designed to get those lighting and sound engineers working by providing opportunities for shows to go ahead. That is partly the reason that scheme was designed, to complement the CRSS, which provides support to venues in particular. Was there another question the Deputy wanted answered in that time?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, we have the business continuity scheme, which complements the CRSS. It is something we can look at. The adaptation grant fund has been designed to mitigate the costs incurred by tourism-specific businesses. For Fáilte Ireland to identify tourism businesses in the application process, a set of eligibility criteria for each business category was developed. Under those criteria, only restaurants and cafés with a wine retailer's on-licence or special restaurant licence were eligible to apply. Many small independent cafés serving a mainly local population are not deemed, therefore, to be predominantly tourism businesses. That is the issue there. Operationally, it might be difficult to identify all businesses, such as cafés, that would be eligible. These businesses are eligible to apply for other Government-funded Covid-19 support schemes, including the restart grant plus.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can get my officials to arrange a meeting if the Deputy wants me to.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am in the process of arranging that meeting with the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland. I believe it is in the middle of November that that meeting is actually scheduled for. I have also met in recent weeks with RTÉ, Virgin Media Ireland, TG4 and news brands. Regarding the query about the support of local media, and the Deputy mentioned Kerry, I would know myself, and the Chair would know, from when we were growing up how the local newspaper is the newspaper that sits on the coffee table for the week. I know that local radio is the first thing that is turned on in the morning. For me growing up, it was Northern Sound, the Anglo-Celt and The Northern Standard. Such media are the linchpin of a home and are the very sources of information only that some people in communities turn to. That local print and local radio are fundamentally important to our society. In recognition of that, the Taoiseach and I nominated to the Future of Media Commission Ms Siobhán Holliman, who has worked as deputy editor of the Tuam Herald but also has experience in Galway Bay FM and MidWest Radio. We have definitely seen through the Covid crisis how important trusted sources of media are. They are actually more important now than ever before. That is why the work of that commission is important when it looks at the funding and keeping such sources alive. In the shorter term, the BAI waived levies for the radio sector early this year in acknowledgement of the financial crisis that we are facing. I also gave additional funding of €2 million to the BAI's sound and vision fund under the July stimulus package, which will help support local radio and television production. I am conscious that supporting local media through advertising is hugely important and it helps deliver important safety messages to people whose medium of choice is that local newspaper or the local radio station. It helps to support and sustain that vibrant local media sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The commission is to be seen as an expert group rather than a representative group. Ms Siobhan Holliman is a recent appointment. She is in place in her capacity as an expert but she is also a member of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ. She is in place in her expert capacity.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We gave the matter consideration. As I mentioned at the time, the commission is really an expert group rather than a representative group. It is about having expertise in the group on the commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is the first half of this year. I want to make a comment on the issue of unions. I guarantee Deputy Munster that the Future of Media Commission will consult widely with everyone, including all stakeholders.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They will be consulted. On Deputy Munster's second question on the levy, it relates to the first half of 2020.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We will consult the BAI on other ways of supporting the radio sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The waiver relates to the first half of 2020. We will engage with and consult the BAI about how best to support the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, not yet.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will check. I want to get Deputy Munster the exact detail. The announcement will be made shortly. It is for the current period, but the announcement has not been made yet.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is this year. I will also be getting quarterly reports from the BAI on the radio sector. The BAI is currently running the scheme. The authority will announce results in the coming month or so. That is for the current period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Deputy asking about the exact months? I said in the announcement that it was the current period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will Deputy Munster repeat the question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the question relates to travel to a recording studio, that is a matter to which I can give consideration.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, absolutely.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is Deputy Munster talking about the allocation of €263 million?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government committed additional funding of €262 million for sector support in my Department in 2021 over and above the initial 2020 allocation. Along with the additional funding of €183.445 million already provided in 2020 to support these sectors, the figure represented a total allocation of €445 million across 2020 and into 2021 to assist the sectors. They were among the first to close and the last to return. I believe it is clear that the funding shows the commitment and ongoing support for these sectors.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As well as the additional funding, €183.445 million had already been provided in 2020 to support these sectors. Additional funding of €262 million was provided for the sectors supported by my Department in 2021 over and above the initial 2020 allocation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will have to get Deputy Munster the exact figure for the Covid allocation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The aim of the pilot live performance support scheme is to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performance to provide employment to the workers in the creative industries. That is the very reason we designed it. The pilot scheme, with funding of €5 million, is to inform us on how we will then do the next one, for which I secured €50 million in the budget. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector, allow commercial organisers of live performance to commence preparations immediately and for productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. The Senator asked about eligibility for the scheme. To be eligible for the scheme, a promoter is required to have a proven track record of live performances undertaken in the past three years; a plan to hold a live performance event that will commence in 2020; provide three years of financial accounts; be tax compliant; not ordinarily in receipt of funding from the public sector but provide evidence of matched funding required at this stage. This pilot scheme was the first of its kind. It was developed following close consultation with the sector and it will inform future similar schemes. In helping these events to go ahead, it will help employment also.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That which-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can guarantee to the Senator that the Department would only give out the money if the event is going ahead. We will be watching that space very carefully because it is essential that those involved in this industry get the opportunity to work again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Arts & Culture Recovery Task Force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is one report and I have received it. I will be giving it consideration this week and then bringing it to the Government. The Senator might be thinking of the statement I made at the previous committee that I had asked them to give me a list of their priorities ahead of the budget but that was not an interim report. As they had only set up at that stage I asked them to consult with me but the final report has just arrived. I will be examining it and then bringing it to the Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Very shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to circuses, the Arts Council supports and funds them. Regarding the live entertainment, we will be seeing the invoices so that will be the proof. The stay and spend initiative will be in place until the end of spring. Being in level 5 shows the seriousness of the current health situation but we are hopeful that it will be of benefit when people come out of those restrictions. It is essential that we have the supports in place for when these businesses emerge from level 5, and part of that exit strategy is the supports that will be in place.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It has not been considered yet. The stay and spend initiative came about in consultation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. It is something we can examine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I gave that commitment. I believe that meeting will happen on 16 November. I absolutely appreciate community radio. LMFM and the other station, Northern Sound, in Carrickmacross, are the stations one listens to. I will address a meeting of Craol, the community radio group, this Friday, so I very much appreciate the value of local and community radio. The BAI provided €750,000 for community radio in recognition of their value. Community radio is fundamental to our local communities, especially those in rural Ireland. Turning on the local radio station was the first thing we did in the morning. It is the only one on which we rely. There have been 30 centrally co-ordinated campaigns on Covid since March. More than half of those have included local print and almost all included local radio. I intend to ask for an analysis of the advertising spread by Government in terms of Covid-related media messaging to allow us to understand more about the spread and breadth of Government advertising and how it can feed into radio.The Deputy has given me a heads up on the questions they will be asking at that meeting on 16 November and I look forward to engaging with them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Senator might have to come back to me on some of them. On the national cultural institutions, it has been very difficult for them. As I said, the public health restrictions and our being in level 5 are a recognition of the crisis we are in. I would very much like to see the galleries open but it is about keeping as many essential services open as possible. That is where we are at in the current level. They have been very innovative in putting material online. On the question on amateur drama, €250,000 is available to that sector in 2020 through the Arts Council.  There are four vacancies on the boards of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and RTÉ. Under the Broadcasting Act 2009, these vacancies fall to be filled by me but upon recommendation from this committee. The process of the appointments was delayed because of the general election and then the establishment of this committee. I intend to write to the Chairman this week inviting recommendations from this committee for those boards. The online safety and media regulation Bill is a very large one that will require detailed consideration, particularly by this committee. Pre-legislative scrutiny of it will be essential given the fundamental issues involved. It will come before this committee. I cannot give an exact date for that but it will be in the coming months. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The different platforms and all those issues related to online platforms will be looked at. I am aware of the issue concerning golf tour operators. I received communications from them. We will examine in the Department if the support scheme I announced in the context of the budget is something that can help the golf tour operators. The Senator asked another question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I hope to establish that in the very near future. I am currently considering its membership.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Deputy referring to a three-year plan for the tourism sector?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The report is based on a three-year recovery plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That was for the tourism task force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would the Deputy like that approach for all of them?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay. The arts task force has already issued its report to me, so I cannot change it at this stage. Everyone is looking at survival and the recovery period, so we are looking beyond Covid. Intensive stakeholder engagement is happening in the process on the night-time economy task force. We are meeting the representative group for musicians and performers early next week to get feedback on how supports can reach the exact group of musicians to whom the Deputy referred.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am liaising with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on that, given that it is something that impacts both Departments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I look forward to engaging with representatives of local radio on 16 November. The €50 million live entertainment scheme I announced in the recent budget is designed to help the exact cohort of musicians the Deputy is talking about. My aim is to support all sectors. There are musicians now reaching out for funds who have never had to do so before. That is why we made that unprecedented funding available for them, a sector that we never had to fund before. We are currently in level 5 and that is why the restrictions are so hard. It is a reflection of the emergency that we are in. It is about providing a basket of measures to keep us safe. I have a lot of areas under my remit but churches are not one of them. I absolutely understand the need for the solace that they provide and it is something that we, as a Government, need to look at, especially as Christmas time approaches. It is not under the remit of my Department but, as a member of the Government, I will raise those concerns. I sing in my local church choir. Would it not be great to hear Christmas carols?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have to do what is best for our health. It is about trying to find that balance. The numbers have been improving in recent days. We have to be guided by the experts as to what will keep our people safe.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Future of Media Commission had its inaugural meeting last week. When it was announced by the previous Government it was a different type of commission. We have broadened it out. The previous commission was for public service only. The wider commission encompasses all media which, I am sure the Senator will agree, is vitally important because it has to be tackled because of the changing ways in which people access news and information. I totally value local newspapers and I intend to ask for analysis of the advertising spread by the Government on Covid-related media messaging so we can understand more about it and see whether there is a way to support local newspapers. Recently, I met news brands to discuss their concerns about revenue. The NUJ recovery plan has been referred to the chair of the Future of Media Commission. With regard to RTÉ, I am liaising very closely with it and NewERA on the issue of RTÉ's finances.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the session musicians to whom the Deputy referred, I will meet the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, again next week. I will also meet sound technicians and others who work behind the scenes to make a performance happen. The purpose of the pilot scheme I initiated with €5 million was to reach those musicians, get them working again and provide supports for the crews as well as the artists. The scheme is for artists and arts workers. I am trying to engage as extensively as possible to reach them all. There are people seeking support who never thought they would have to do so. My goal is to reach as many of them as possible. It is through the extensive engagement that we will find ways to do that. As the Deputy can appreciate, the development of the pilot scheme of €5 million into a €50 million scheme for next year presents great opportunities to give support. The Covid response support scheme, CRSS, is a complementary scheme and these schemes work hand in hand. I hope I will be able to cover any areas that are not covered by the CRSS. As I say, it is about reaching as many people as possible to make sure we can put on the great performances again that we all love. On music tuition and the comparison with sport, the latter takes place outdoors whereas music tuition is held indoors. My children are doing piano lessons by Zoom. It is something they missed in the first lockdown but tuition is happening now. We are engaging with the Department of Education to ensure there is greater clarity. I do not have any specific role in this area but I am involved in cross-departmental work to see if we can get clarity on it. On local media, as I have stated previously, I recognise the value of and need for supports for the local media and I will meet the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, in November.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is an issue for the Arts Council to decide. As I have said here, the Arts Council has said that people are seeking funding and applying for bursaries who never had to previously. It is similar with the live performance support scheme. As we said at the budget, it is a sector that we never had to engage with. It is a first for us and it is a first for them. That is why that live performance support scheme is something new for the sector. The Arts Council itself will conduct that engagement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the template and the criteria, yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are engaged in it as well. For example, I asked that DEIS schools be very much considered in the programme since I came in because I want those in disadvantaged schools to be looked after. There is an increase in that as well. Creative schools is funded by us and matched by funding from the Department of Education.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have met them twice since I took office. I am waiting for the NewERA report. I need to see the NewERA in relation to RTÉ funding and that is what I have said to them. The report is due shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the monitoring group relating to the tourism recovery task force, I hope to establish it shortly. I am currently looking at the membership of it. The stay-and-spend scheme comes under the remit of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, but I will consult him on that because it has an impact on the sector I represent.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith anseo chun labhairt faoi thosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne. I intend to address the committee on tourism, culture, arts and media and my colleague, the Minister of State, will address matters relating to sport and the Gaeltacht. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee on the key priorities of my Department and to set out the vision for these wide-ranging and valuable sectors. These sectors contribute significantly to our country’s economy while also supporting individual and community well-being right across Ireland. It is important, however, that we recognise the ongoing impact the global Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health measures continue to have on these sectors, on the people who work in them and on the communities that depend on them. When I last addressed this committee in November, I spoke about the devastating impact that has been felt by workers and businesses throughout our tourism, culture, arts, sports, Gaeltacht and media sectors, as well as the measures that my Department had put into place to mitigate against the harmful effects of the pandemic. We have since faced another wave of the virus and, along with it, another period of level 5 restrictions has been imposed on these hard-hit sectors. I am deeply conscious of the effects that measures taken in the interests of public health have had on our ability to participate in the arts, to watch a match or to enjoy a meal or a night out with friends, as well as the ability for artists, workers and businesses to provide these uniquely valued experiences. We should also recognise that the tough decisions that were made have enabled all of us, through collective action, to protect the most vulnerable in our society. With the ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme, we find ourselves at the beginning of a process where we can start to move on from the pandemic and focus our efforts on economic and social recovery. Over the coming months, as the restrictions ease and the vaccine programme is rolled out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society, and with it our tourism sector, our arts and culture venues and events and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds. I am confident that the Government is ready to meet the challenges and opportunities of recovery. Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead recognises, in particular, the need for bespoke sectoral supports to address the worst affected sectors, such as tourism and culture, in the forthcoming national economic recovery plan. Last week we saw the initial easing of some restrictions and yesterday saw the return of more high-performance sports and training for adult inter-county GAA teams. This is just the beginning of the positive changes we hope to see this year. From 26 April, our young people will be able to return to outdoor non-contact sports and dance training, which will provide a much needed well-being dividend. We are guided at all times by the health advice, we look forward to returning to in-person cultural and sporting events and being able to visit galleries, museums and libraries. The prospect of being able to eat in a restaurant or café or go on holidays within Ireland is on the horizon if the epidemiological position continues to improve. We are looking forward to the time we can welcome international visitors back to our shores. As we emerge from the most difficult period of the pandemic, my Department will continue to prioritise the development and implementation of targeted supports for the sectors most affected by the pandemic. We will also work across Government to develop a national economic recovery plan that addresses the specific sectoral issues of our sectors, in line with the commitment set out in Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead. I announced a new €55 million support fund as part of budget 2021 for strategic tourism businesses and €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector. These measures will complement the employment wage subsidy scheme, pandemic unemployment payment and Covid restrictions support scheme schemes and the restart scheme. Recently, as part of a suite of measures to support the live entertainment sector, I was pleased to announce details of a €25 million live performance support scheme for 2021, which is aimed at supporting employment and well-being opportunities across all genres of live entertainment and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. I also recently announced the new music and entertainment business assistance scheme, which will make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, including musicians, crew and engineers, that have been significantly negatively affected by Covid-19 and that do not have a rateable premises. Earlier this month, initial applications opened for a new €17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme being delivered in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities across the country. This scheme will provide funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their outdoor seating capacity and will also provide funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres, similar to those that exist in various European cities. These are just some examples of the kinds of supports that are needed to support hard-hit sectors as we transition out of the current restrictions, and I will continue to do everything-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sure. Tourism, culture, arts, language, sport and media are an integral part of the fabric of our society and democracy, serving to enhance our physical, mental and social well-being. As we overcome the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, I am looking forward to turning our attention to the restoration of these activities that sustain us and bring joy to our lives. I will ensure that the sectors can, in time, again become vital components of our economy, our social lives and our well-being. This will require a strategic approach and long-term vision. The Minister of State will now speak to sport and Gaeltacht matters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Cassells. Of course, international travel, as we know, accounts for 75% of the revenue generated by the sector due to the pandemic. Specifically, because the time is short, in relation to supports, the Government has committed that there will be no cliff edge. Of course, tourism is one of the impacted sectors recognised in the path ahead and we will be looking at that in the context of the national economic recovery plan. The Tánaiste and I have a tourism and hospitality forum. The next meeting is in May. Also, I presented the report from the tourism oversight group to my colleagues at Cabinet and have discussed it with Cabinet colleagues as well. That identifies the key supports that are needed. As I said, there will be no cliff edge. We absolutely recognise the need for support throughout the reopening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Quickly, on the tourism oversight group, that is set up to oversee the recommendations from that sector. It is not a representative group but, rather, it is made up of an independent chairperson and eight other members with a broad spectrum of backgrounds who were selected on the basis of each person's capacity to bring their knowledge, skills, experience, competence, capability and strategic leadership to the ideas of this working group. It is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations. The groups that the Senator mentioned are on the hospitality and tourism forum, which meets the Tánaiste and me regularly. It includes representatives from the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association etc., to name but a few. They will be meeting me and the Tánaiste again this month. At the previous meeting, the Taoiseach met them as well. In relation to the stay-and-spend scheme, that was set up last summer by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. Of course, it was to target that off-peak season. However, public health conditions beyond our control clearly prevented the success of this scheme. That stop-and-start nature of the pandemic and unpredictable consequences have resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised. A review of the stay-and-spend scheme is one of the recommendations of the tourism recovery oversight group and I have urged Cabinet colleagues to look at that. I am in favour of a scheme that would provide a boost to the industry in that off-peak season. Once the scheme ends at the end of this month, it is anticipated that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will take stock and look at what supports would be best suited to the tourism sector to be put in place for that off-peak season again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will get back to the Deputy on insurance for the outdoor dining scheme. As he will be aware, it is €500 million for outdoor seating accessories for tourism and hospitality and €12 million for the local authority structures. I will get back to the Deputy with a note on that insurance query. The charter boat operators were invited to apply for the first stage of that €55 million tourism business continuity scheme. I know some operators are disappointed that they were found ineligible because they did not have a minimum annual turnover, as the Deputy said, of €50,000. The rationale for this requirement is that the focus of the tourism business continuity scheme is to support strategic tourism businesses to offset fixed costs incurred in 2020 and support them to continue operating in 2021. That eligibility criteria for the €50,000 threshold is based on the likelihood that for a business with a turnover of less than €50,000, the non-payroll fixed costs will be sufficiently low to enable the owners to furlough the business by availing of other state aids, namely, income supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, thereby enabling these businesses to re-emerge as public health restrictions ease.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I share the Senator's enthusiasm and look forward to a return of outdoor performances. Unfortunately, the public health advice is that it is still too early to say when that will happen. We must look at the case numbers, hospitalisations, vaccinations and variants of concern. As the Senator will be aware, the Government will meet in advance of 4 May to review the level of restrictions and see what can be done. I have two schemes in place to facilitate that. The €5 million for live performance schemes in local authority areas is to employ and engage live performers during the summer months and help them programme for outdoor live performances. The outdoor public spaces scheme of up to €250,000 is for projects to create those spaces for us all to enjoy. At the minute, however, it is too early to say when but I am cautiously optimistic for the summer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sorry about that. I just keep switching on and off. I am very familiar with the great work done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. My children participate in it by Zoom. It has done a wonderful job of keeping it going, even though it is by Zoom. My Department does gives funding and grant assistance to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Additional resources were given last year for its great work, and we are engaged with Comhaltas on an ongoing basis as to its needs. Outdoor dance classes will resume in line with outdoor training for young people next week, but I am happy to engage with specific groups if Deputy McGrath wants to give me the details.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The night-time economy is a hugely important sector, as the Senator said, contributing to our economy and our cultural and creative sectors. It can have a really positive impact on our well-being and has really felt the brunt of the pandemic due to the sector's very nature. I was delighted to establish the night-time economy task force last July, and the Senator will be aware that it has been examining all the challenges facing the vibrant night-time culture and economy such as regulations and licensing laws, transport and diversity of cultural activities. A huge demand for diversity of offering and flexibility in the operating environment arose from in-depth and extensive consultations. There has been a positive indication from the Minister, Deputy McEntee, regarding the modernisation of the licensing laws. That is a really positive outcome from the ongoing work of the task force. The task force is due to finalise its report, I expect, in the coming weeks with its practical recommendations, and I intend to publish the report once I have reflected on the findings, so yes, it will be published and available to the Senator. However, we have to get much more creative in our thinking and in innovative solutions to the challenges facing the night-time economy. Every opportunity has to be explored. Senator Warfield is correct that the current iteration of Creative Ireland will come to an end next year. My officials are preparing proposals, which I hope to bring to Cabinet, that will seek to extend the programme, in particular Creative Communities, through local authorities and Creative Ireland's wonderful work increasing access to creative opportunities for our young people. That has proven to be really impactful and I would like to see it continue. I hope to see that report in May.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his feedback on the LPSS. I know that venues such as De Barra's Folk Club, Connolly's of Leap and many others did great work under the scheme. We hope to see a lot more of this with the recent scheme which closed for applications just last week. I absolutely understand the sector's need for clarity and certainty. I have extensive and ongoing engagement with the sector. However, it is still about the public health advice, as I said earlier. It is still too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased, given the current uncertainties. Based on my engagement with people from the sector, they find the speculation quite unhelpful so I do not want to engage in it. I prefer certainty too but at the minute, the restrictions and the public health advice do not allow me to give that certainty just yet. It comes down to the case numbers, the hospitalisations, the vaccinations and the variants. The Government is meeting in advance of 4 May to look at what May, June and July will look like and as I said earlier, I am cautiously optimistic, and when it is safe to do so we will look at that. There is also the tourism and hospitality forum. I addressed that issue regarding the oversight group, which is a more representative group and the bodies the Deputy is talking about are part of the tourism and hospitality forum the Tánaiste and I have established. We will meet again in May. At the last meeting, we brought the Taoiseach in to hear the concerns of all the members. The Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association, Drinks Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are just some of the stakeholders in the forum. On the specific supports the Deputy mentioned, everything will be examined. A lot of those supports are in the recommendations of that tourism oversight group so I have brought that to the attention of my Cabinet colleagues and we will look at everything in the context of the national economic recovery plan. On the stay-and-spend scheme, as I mentioned earlier, the stop-start nature of the pandemic has resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised. I am in favour of a scheme that would give a boost to the industry in the off-season. It was designed for the off-season and has attracted consumers. It was my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who did that. It was an innovative scheme but as I said, the stop and start nature of the pandemic led to it being underutilised. It is anticipated the Minister for Finance will take stock of the scheme as we reach the end of the month and look to see what appropriate measures could be put in place for the off-peak season.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the theatres, I conducted that pilot in the Abbey Theatre and in the National Concert Hall, and the feedback was very positive. Due to public health advice, it is still too early to give a definite date for theatres. Obviously, it is something I would like to happen. On the return to live events, the theatre forum is on the expert group that is examining the roadmap for a return. That will be helpful. Outdoor dance for groups of up to 15 will be permitted. It is the same for all non-contact outdoor activities, so it will be allowed. On the elite artists, we are engaging with the sector on that specific point about artists' travel. Unfortunately, at present there is no opportunity to perform, but we are in engagement with them. The circus is an art form and it is funded by the Arts Council. The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions, but I will relay the Senator's concerns to it. Like me, the Senator is an advocate for the basic income. As I told him, he is pushing an open door with me on the issue. The basic income by its nature supports creativity and innovation. That specific recommendation has been very well received, and not only here. Even internationally, journalists are talking about it. The latest information is that an oversight group has been established to deal with the recommendations. I have given direction to the oversight group to prioritise the basic income. The Ministers in the relevant Departments are supportive of this proposal being examined. Of course, any proposal on this will not just come from my Department so it is positive that the relevant Ministers are supportive. On a personal level, the Senator is pushing an open door with me, as it would be with the Senator. It is the most important recommendation of that report and I have asked the oversight group to prioritise it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The €17 million outdoor dining scheme is being administered by Fáilte Ireland through the local authorities and there are two elements to it. There is the €5 million element, which is for outdoor seating and accessories for tourism and hospitality businesses, and the second element is the €12 million for local authority structures for weatherproofing and outdoor dining infrastructure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, the aim of the scheme is to support local authorities and businesses to increase and operate their outdoor dining offering. It is up to the businesses to apply. I am sure many businesses in County Louth will do so.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That will depend on how many businesses apply and how much money they want. The maximum grant for an individual business is €4,000. It will depend on how many wish to apply and how many wish to go for the €4,000 maximum. Fáilte Ireland will be running the scheme and assessing the applications.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is €4,000 per business. This has been really well received by the Restaurants Association of Ireland and all businesses. I have not heard an individual business question this but rather welcome it. It depends on the individual applications.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand why the Deputy is asking. Fáilte Ireland did the assessment. The scheme was developed by Fáilte Ireland based on its knowledge and engagement with the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not a case that I do not know, Deputy Munster, with respect. What I am saying is Fáilte Ireland developed the scheme based on its knowledge and engagement with the sector. Based on the response to this from the sector it has been very well received. It is one of the most positively received schemes we have and I have not heard the questions being raised by the Deputy. I have only heard positive affirmation of the scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can get the information for the Deputy but I suspect that for the businesses concerned the priority is not the reasoning of the allocation but rather the actual allocation and how helpful it is to them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	All supports, including the CRSS, will be considered. I am a strong advocate for the sector and this is reflected every time the Taoiseach makes an announcement. I reflect that the sector needs supports. I am a very strong advocate and voice for the sector and it knows it from its engagement with me. As I said earlier in reply to other members, the Tánaiste and I will meet the tourism and hospitality sectors in May. We have brought in the Taoiseach to hear their concerns. I asked for recommendations on the supports to be on the agenda for the meeting that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and I attended. I felt it was also essential for the Taoiseach to hear them. The Deputy can be sure I am a loud advocate for the sector. Reopening is dependent on public health conditions. It is about the public health advice and the case numbers, hospitalisations, vaccinations and variants of concern. I am anxious for the sectors to reopen but we want them to do so as soon as it is safe. With regard to the stay and spend scheme, when the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, launched it he did not foresee the stop-start nature of the pandemic and how it led to the scheme being completely underutilised. As I said in reply to previous speakers, I am in favour of a scheme that gives an essential boost to the industry. Everything should be considered by the Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can ask Fáilte Ireland to engage with Louth County Council on the scheme if that would be helpful.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding local creative youth partnerships, those are in the gift of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, as it is led by her Department. A significant announcement about that initiative will be made on 13 May at the creative youth conference, in which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and I will participate along with panellists from the areas of education and business. We are very keen to expand these partnerships and I have engaged with the Minister for Education in that regard. As the Chair said, the ETBs have been brilliant at targeting the most disadvantaged young people, and the Deputy knows this from her previous work. Regarding the basic income, I express my thanks to the committee for its support of the proposal. I welcome the committee's support for this initiative. I reiterate that I am working with colleagues to progress the appraisal of this recommendation. I am very supportive of it. I have indicated to the oversight group that the number one priority is determining how this can be done. The Ministers from the relevant Department, whose officials sit on that oversight group, are key in this regard. I confirm those Ministers are supportive of this proposal being examined. That is very positive. I am strongly advocating for a basic income. It would be a game changer for the arts, so it came as no surprise to me that this proposal was being sought as the number one recommendation. Moving to the tourism oversight group, it is not a representative group. It is there to examine the implementation of the recommendations. What I said was that the restaurant and pub sector had its voice on the tourism and hospitality forum, which the Tánaiste and I set up in the autumn of last year. We have another meeting in May. However, all those relevant sectors which the Chair mentioned are on that tourism and hospitality forum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, because it is not a representative group. The voice of the restaurant and pub sector is heard by the Tánaiste and me in the tourism and hospitality forum. The oversight group is not a representative body. Moving on to the State boards, those appointments are made through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process and it is open to all applicants. I do not direct those appointments. The stay and spend scheme, as I remarked earlier, was completely underutilised because of the stop-start nature of the pandemic. The scheme was designed for the off-peak season. It is my understanding the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will take stock of the situation and look at the relevant supports. As I said, however, there will be no cliff edge cut-off of supports for the sector, and we will look to see what relevant supports can be put in place for that off-peak season.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have kept funding for international marketing in place with Tourism Ireland all along. Contained within the programme for Government is The Year of The Invitation. I think that initiative is along the lines of what Deputy Crowe is talking about and it is a commitment in the programme for Government. It is envisaged for the moment for 2023, but we are engaging with the sector in that regard. However, I think that is exactly along the lines of what Deputy Crowe was saying.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Recommendations concerning the requisite supports were presented to me and I brought them to Cabinet. Everything will be considered, and the outcome will depend on when things reopen. The Government has given the guarantee that there will be no cliff edge cut-off in the supports. These sectors will need support beyond their reopening. We are very aware of that aspect from our engagement with the industry. That commitment exists. It was recognised in the national economic recovery plan that tourism was one of the sectors most impacted. The Taoiseach also flagged this as one of the sectors which will need supports on the path ahead.Everything will be considered for the supports, not just for reopening but also beyond.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier, we are guided by the public health advice, which depends on the numbers for case numbers, hospitalisations, variants and vaccinations. We can be cautiously optimistic for reopening but the difference with museums, galleries or theatres is that theatres are enclosed and seated venues. This is quite different from walking through a gallery. Nobody would like to see them open more than I would. This is why I made sure to have that pilot for theatre in December. We will continue to be guided by the health advice, but the Senator can rest assured that I will be advocating for this. As soon as it is safe to do so, they will reopen. We must, however, be guided by public health advice.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We said we would look at May for museums and galleries. We have indicated that when we come to the end of April, we will look at museums and galleries. This is a positive first step for the reopening of culture and arts. It is significant that this is happening in May. As I said, theatre is slightly different because it is enclosed seating. As soon as it is safe to do so, rest assured I will be looking for that. We have to go with public health advice on this. Based on the recent numbers it is looking more positive for us. I absolutely agree on the issue of rebuilding our cultural identity. We are a nation that has spoken so much about how much we value the arts.We have all felt it and as we emerge out of this, it is not just a case of getting these cultural institutions reopened or performers back on stage but of supporting them beyond that and showing the intrinsic value they have to us and our very being as a nation. That is essential. I am absolutely determined to work with my Cabinet colleagues, performers and all stakeholders to identify the best way not just to support them but to really emphasise the value we place on our arts and culture, which have been so sorely missed in the past year. I do not know if the Senator caught the programme on TG4 for President Michael D. Higgins's birthday. It was wonderful. Every time I hear magnificent performances like that it brings sadness to me, as I think it does to everyone else, because it emphasises how much we miss hearing those performances and how we yearn to return to theatre or hear someone sing live, and more important, how that performer yearns to have that interaction with an audience again. My priority right now is the reopening of this sector as soon as possible but beyond that, it is working with colleagues like the Senator on identifying the ways we can show how much we as a nation value our arts and culture.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I ask members to please communicate with me and I will give everything consideration and get back to them. Did the committee communicate in writing with Fáilte Ireland on that query?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay. I will connect with Fáilte Ireland on that exact question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would hope to have that in the summer. That is the plan for when to expect the report from the commission, which will include all the recommendations. I do not expect it to give individual recommendations at different times. I expect to see that report in the summer.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Go raibh míle maith agat a Chathaoirligh. Táim thar a bheith sásta bheith libh chun labhairt faoi tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne. I intend to address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, and Media while my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, will address matters related to sport. I understand that matters relating to the Gaeltacht will be dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Irish-speaking Community. I am pleased to have this further opportunity to address the committee on the key priorities of my Department and to set out the vision for these wide-ranging and valuable sectors. I spoke to the committee last about my priorities in April this year. At that time, I said that these sectors contribute significantly to our country’s economy, while also supporting individual and community well-being right across Ireland. However, there is no doubt that the diverse range of sectors served by my Department have been, and continue to be, amongst those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. These sectors are fundamental to societal well-being. They encourage public confidence and our collective resilience as we continue to emerge from the pandemic over the longer term. They also remain among the most vulnerable to the cruel unpredictability of this devastating disease. It has been said many times that they were the first to close and last to reopen. A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, in order that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery. During 2021, the €55 million support fund announced as part of budget 2021 for strategic tourism businesses, and the €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector, continued to be provided. These measures have complemented the horizontal measures employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS; the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP; the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS; and the restart scheme. I also launched a €17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme, which is delivered in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities across the country. For the coming year, €288.5 million is allocated for tourism services, which represents an increase of €67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation. The additional funding will help to address immediate survival-related concerns for business continuity, domestic and international marketing, and support for tourism product development, while also enabling further resilience and recovery across the industry as we reopen to international tourism and transition to a more sustainable future. I was very cognisant of the challenges the restrictions caused for the arts, culture and live entertainment industry in 2021, and I allocated more than €60 million to support the sector and drive employment opportunities for artists and crew through the introduction of several new schemes. Those included the provision of support for live entertainment businesses, encompassing a new live performance support scheme, a new support scheme for live events and entertainment businesses, and funding to support local authorities for outdoor live performances. As part of budget 2022, I maintained the Arts Council allocation at the record level of €130 million. This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties. With these ongoing levels of public funding in 2022, the Arts Council is empowered to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead. I have also allocated €25 million for the live entertainment sector as part of budget 2022, and I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible. The supports provided have been essential for those hardest-hit, and I will continue to do everything possible to ensure necessary provisions are in place to allow these sectors, which are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being, to thrive once again. Regarding my Department’s capital programme, I worked closely with colleagues across Government to renew our national development plan. The programme for Government makes strong commitments to continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure. My priorities under the renewed national development plan are aligned under three categories of activities my Department undertakes to support and develop its sectors: supporting economic recovery and resilience, promoting well-being and social cohesion, and providing sustainability and guardianship of our cultural, linguistic and environmental resources. A key priority for my Department is the continued safeguarding and modernisation of institutions through the national cultural institutions, NCI, investment programme in the national development plan, NDP. This is an ambitious €460 million programme of capital investment across all our NCIs which will ensure they can continue their legacy of providing engaging cultural and artistic offerings to the people. The national development plan also includes €265 million for a cultural and creativity investment programme. The large-scale sports infrastructure fund and sports capital and equipment programme are also key elements of my Department’s NDP plans, which will be further addressed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. As we continue the recovery, my Department will work to deliver on priorities that are informed by the programme for Government. My Department’s key priorities for economic recovery are also informed by the tourism and arts and culture recovery task forces, which were established to provide recommendations for overcoming the challenges faced by these critical sectors. Ireland’s tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits the development of rural Ireland, especially in regions that lack an intensive industry base or are economically fragile. For tourism, recovery and sustainable growth are essential. This will begin with a survival, stabilisation and recovery programme informed by the recommendations of the tourism recovery task force as well as inputs from the tourism recovery oversight group. I continue to work on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years towards ascertaining that we have a tourism sector that is socially and economically sustainable and that ensures sustainability is at the heart of the recovery in the sector. This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment as we develop our national tourism product. This investment programme will take a regions-led approach and will include investments in activity-based tourism, with a particular emphasis on the outdoors, and the development of strategic tourism locations. As well as investing in our tourism product, these investments will provide important supports for regional enterprise and employment, and these are often located in areas where tourism is a key driver of the local economy. The significant increase in funding for this sector provides an opportunity to reimagine and reconfigure Ireland’s tourism for the future. With the climate emergency as our backdrop, we must also play our part. The future we imagine is one that will tell the story of our ancient past and our current modern communities, and one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty. Turning to our arts and culture sector, last year the arts and culture recovery task force submitted to me its report, entitled Life worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors. We have made significant progress already on implementing the report. For example, I was particularly pleased to announce €25 million for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022. This is a major policy intervention for the arts and culture sector that requires significant resources from my Department to develop. Work is ongoing and regular engagement with the sector is taking place. My ambition is to open the pilot scheme for applications early next year. I believe this makes a strong statement about the value we place on the arts sector, where employment is characterised by low, precarious and sometimes seasonal income. Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society, and perhaps never more so felt than during this pandemic. I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector, and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists after the difficult circumstances they have endured during the crisis. The report of the night-time economy task force was published in September and contained several practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy as well as some pilot measures to support new developments in this area. Work is also ongoing on the flagship digitisation of the 1926 census records this year, which will provide a further valuable set of records for genealogists across our global Irish community. My Department has a range of key priorities in this area and I look forward to discussing them with the committee. These include support for culture activities in the State-supported and commercial sectors, in which the Arts Council will play a central role. My Department also continues to work on supporting the creative industries, including the audiovisual sector. A key priority in this area will be the continued implementation of the audiovisual action plan over the coming years. It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and to safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content that are so essential to a democratic society. I am very aware of the important role played by the broadcasting and media sector in delivering key and necessary public health messages in recent times. Some examples of measures in budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional €4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which is the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the €5.5 million allocated for the media commission. This funding will be used for the setting up and commencement of the media commission’s functions, to recruit an online safety commissioner and to lay the groundwork for an effective regulatory structure. The spread and amplification of harmful online content raises serious concerns, and this will help us close a gap in Irish and international law concerning online safety. Regarding the enabling legislation for the online safety and media regulation Bill, I also thank this committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill. The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill. I commend the thorough and consultative approach taken by the committee in conducting its pre-legislative scrutiny. It represents a continuity of the approach in developing the general scheme, which involved public consultation and significant stakeholder engagement. I am closely considering all the recommendations. Some deal with issues I have been examining for some time, and this includes how the Bill can be further strengthened to better protect individuals online, including by addressing issues relating to the appropriate avenues of complaint or redress. I intend to progress the Bill as a matter of urgency following the current consideration. Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and democracy. As Minister with responsibility in this area, I will continue to advocate intensely for these sectors, as we all understand there is still much work left to do. I will also continue consulting with the sectors and assessing supports in that regard. We are operating in the shadow of Covid-19 and our recovery will not be easy. It will not happen overnight, but I am confident Ireland will recover. Our world-renowned tourism industry will welcome visitors back better than ever; our vibrant arts and culture sector will flourish again, showcasing our incredible talents both at home and abroad; we will have a rich landscape in which our language can continue to grow; and we will see our dynamic sports and media sectors strengthened, reinforced and supported. This will require a long-term approach, and all of us here understand these sectors are critical to our lives. I am deeply committed to supporting and realising this strategic vision. I am happy to take any questions members may have later, but I will hand over to the Minister of State now.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. We are all very much aware of the serious impact the pandemic has had on the live performance sector, our musicians and artists. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with a wide range of stakeholders across the sector, with a view to understanding the pressures that are faced and to ensure that the supports meet the needs of the sector. In 2021, I allocated more than €60 million to support the sector and drive employment opportunities. I also introduced €25 million for the live performance support scheme, €16.5 million for the events sector Covid support scheme, €10 million for the local live performance support scheme, €4 million for the music and entertainment support scheme, €5 million for the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme and €1 million for the St. Patrick's Festival.In budget 2022, I allocated €25 million for the live entertainment sector. I have maintained the Arts Council allocation at a record level of €130 million. This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and to assist arts organisations through financial difficulties. My Department will continue to receive feedback on evolving challenges facing the sector. It is on foot of these engagements that the significant supports have been provided. Further funding is available in the recently secured budget. We have continued to engage with the sector on how the supports can be better tailored to meet the needs. The engagement will continue in the coming weeks with a view to opening the supports for applications as soon as possible. If it is the case that these supports are exhausted in 2022 and the pandemic continues to impact on the sectors, we will review the situation. In terms of the social welfare supports, the Department of Social Protection stands ready to provide support to those impacted in the short term. To date, the Government has responded appropriately and has paid out more than €8.9 billion through the PUP and a similar amount via the EWSS. The Government has not been found wanting. I assure the Deputy that we are monitoring the situation closely. The position remains under review. We will take the appropriate measures to support people, if and when required. I also remind the Deputy that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, clearly signalled in his budget speech that he and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, are holding approximately €4 billion of the Covid provision as a contingent reserve in order that we can adapt if faced with the unexpected. Should further measures be warranted to support the sector, I will talk to those Ministers. Regarding the query relating to Wexford, I will revert to the Deputy with more detail on the position in that regard. Wexford is very important from a cultural perspective, not least because of the Opera House and the opera festival. I will revert to the Deputy on the Dun Mhuire Theatre.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This was the number one recommendation of the task force, and I was delighted to secure a commitment to it in the national economic recovery plan and to ring-fence the money in the recent budget. There has been ongoing engagement and an oversight group was set up. Everything is being done in close consultation with the sector. A tender has issued for a partner to develop an online application portal. On 8 December, a significant stakeholder engagement will take place to hear the views of the artists, creatives and the relative resource bodies and representative organisations. This scheme is so important and must be designed in close consultation with the sector, and 8 December will be a key date for the scheme. Stakeholder engagement is key to the success of this policy and has been a cornerstone of my approach to the sector during the pandemic. The launch date for applications and the eligibility criteria will be announced in January following the consultation on 8 December. The consultation will be a global café-style event.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator. As he indicated, the current iteration of Creative Ireland comes to an end shortly. My officials are preparing proposals which seek to extend the programme, in particular the creative communities via local authorities, which I will shortly bring to Cabinet. The work of Creative Ireland in increasing access to creative opportunities for young people has been impactful and will continue. On the creative industries, the Creative Ireland programme consulted extensively with industry bodies, businesspeople, practitioners and academics in the field of design-based digital creative and content creation sub-sectors and with other Departments, agencies and enterprise partners. A roadmap for the creative industries was drafted in 2020, as the Senator will know. However, the Covid-related issues have been prioritised over the past year. With a view towards economic recovery, discussions are again under way concerning how best to finalise and implement the draft roadmap. Comhaltas has committed to the area of dignity and equality in the context of the recent launch of its results and in regard to Speak Up. We are doing a lot of work to reinforce the importance of dignity at work for the creative sectors. For example, we have worked extensively with, and funded, the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI, survey and report on bullying and harassment survey. The ITI will be funded to continue its work, as a starting point in regard to the findings of the survey. It will develop a code of behaviour that organisations can adopt and, in doing so, declare their commitment to provide a safe and dignified workplace. The code will be accessible online and will include a register that organisations and individuals can formally sign. A dignity in the workplace toolkit will be developed for arts organisations and individuals. It will contain comprehensive information on supports and resources for independent workers. This will provide a suite of training tools, starting with bystander training and intimacy co-ordination, and incorporate behaviour modules onto all arts-related accredited courses. It will expand existing resources, including access to counselling, human resources, mediation, and legal consultation, free of charge, to artist art workers. In this area, Minding Creative Minds, which is funded by my Department, has been providing an exemplary service since 2020. We will be developing arrangements for confidential reporting of harmful behaviours without fear of reprisal; build cross-sectoral support for change; continue research in this area; and, as committed to at the launch of the survey, commit to further follow-up service so that we can monitor the success of our actions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The National Library of Ireland is already doing work to digitise websites. We will continue to work with it and the National Archives with a view to addressing the question of digital archives.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We will address that issue of digital archives. I absolutely appreciate its importance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As regards the issue he and Senator Warfield raised, as I stated, it is being considered and we are consulting the National Library of Ireland. I will revert to both of them on that specific issue. As regards clarity and certainty for pubs and restaurants, I wish I was in a position to provide that. The only thing that is certain about Covid-19 is its uncertainty. As the Deputy is aware, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will be meeting this week. We await its deliberations. Just like everyone else, I am not in a position to give clarity or certainty, unfortunately. I can point to the budget, which included an increase of more than 30% for the tourism sector in my Department, and the cross-sectoral supports that are in place already, such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the restart grant, the credit guarantee scheme, the €55 million for the tourism business continuity scheme, the €26 million in the Covid adaptation fund, the €10 million allocation for coach tourism, the €10 million for Ireland-based inbound agencies, the €8 million in restart grants and all the outdoor dining and urban animation schemes. We have not been found wanting in that regard. I do not have a crystal ball - none of us have one - in the context of this awful pandemic that has had a devastating impact on our tourism sector that supports more than 250,000 jobs. The Government will not be found wanting. We will keep everything under review. As regards the business continuity scheme and the money that was ring-fenced in the most recent budget, Fáilte Ireland is in consultation with relevant stakeholders to assess where that money will go. It is open to anyone to apply to the board of Fáilte Ireland. Obviously, we will be looking for specific skill sets, in consultation with the chairman of the board. It is open to anyone to apply to that process. Of course, the hospitality sector does have a strong voice via the tourism and hospitality forum I and the Tánaiste co-chair.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The directors and I will consult with the chairman on that. It then goes through the Public Appointments Service process and that shortlist is brought to me. As I stated, it is open to anyone to apply. It is a fair and transparent process. The hospitality sector has a strong voice via the tourism and hospitality forum. I know this has been a devastating time for those in the sector and that the uncertainty for the sector as we approach Christmas is awful. The Government has not been and will not be found wanting in the context of supports.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, I am trying to write them down to make sure I answer them all. In regard to the media commission, it cannot formally be established until the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is enacted. However, it is my intention to go to the Government in the coming weeks to seek agreement to start the recruitment process for key personnel on an administrative basis in advance of this. That would enable preparatory work to be undertaken to ensure the commission hits the ground running on establishment. The provision of the €5.5 million in funding that I secured in the recent budget will enable that. I reckon the commission will probably require 120 personnel for the start-up phase, with a number of these to be hired before the formal establishment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the individual complaints, this is a matter I have been considering closely for some time. The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is, of course, complex. I am currently looking at the 33 recommendations. I have to commend the committee for the detailed and thorough pre-legislative scrutiny that was done. Although the Senator is talking about one specific recommendation, to have made 33 recommendations shows the complexity of all of this.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am currently examining how this issue and others can be overcome. It is a complex issue. Ireland could actually be regulating for the whole of Europe in respect of video-sharing platforms. That is approximately 450 million people and it brings various languages and cultural norms into it all. It is about how we would actually manage that volume. I am examining how these issues could be overcome in the context of that specific recommendation. That is where we are right now. In regard to the levy, the Bill already provides that such a levy may be introduced by the media commission once its viability has been assessed with regard to whether or not it would have any negative effects. The proceeds of any such levy will go into a content production scheme from which producers could apply for funding, similar to the sound and vision scheme, with which the Senator will be familiar. I hope that answers the question. In regard to the Future of Media Commission, that report currently lies with me and the Taoiseach. We will be consulting key Cabinet colleagues and then bringing it to government. As the Taoiseach said in recent weeks, the terms of reference and recommendations of that commission are pretty substantial so we are giving it consideration. We will consult the relevant Ministers and then bring it before Cabinet. In regard to the basic income, the Senator may have heard me answer on that earlier. There is a key stakeholder agreement consultation on 8 December. We went out to tender for the facilitator of that and it will be a sort of global, café-style forum. I would like as broad a range as possible, which was the Senator’s question. It is so important that the sector is with us all the way in the design of this process, so I would see all of that being discussed on that key date of 8 December. The invites will issue shortly for that consultation process. Was there a final question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree they are operating very well and they are to be admired for it. However, as I said earlier to Deputy Griffin, I cannot give a definitive response on the pandemic and the twists and turns it will take, nor is there any ambition to impose any further restrictions at present. We have to wait and assess the impact of the changes introduced last week and the consistent messaging around individual behaviour. I am, of course, hugely sensitive to the impact of this on live performances in all the venues the Senator has mentioned. As I said earlier, we will not be found wanting in regard to supports. There is the €25 million that was ring-fenced in budget 2022 and there is the money in the Covid fund mentioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath. It will come through him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, if needs be. We have them open and I want to keep them open and I want them to be viable. I hope that is the case. If that does not happen, I can assure the Senator they will receive the supports they need. Let us hope we can turn this around.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The procedure for appointing the board members to RTÉ is set out in section 81 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.That section provides for a board of 12 comprising six members appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister, four appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister after the joint Oireachtas committee process, one staff member and the director general. As the Senator will know, arising from the most recent joint Oireachtas committee process, the Government approved the nomination of four persons to fill the four vacancies. There is now one vacancy because a subsequent resignation took place. I have engaged with the Senator on this. I look forward to hearing from members of the committee regarding a new nominee to the RTÉ board. This is a challenging time for public broadcasting and I look forward to working with the board of RTÉ. I understand that this replacement process is ongoing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier, we are all very aware of the serious impact of the pandemic on the live performance sector and on our musicians and artists. The recent changes-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Deputy will please allow me to answer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not really a "Yes" or "No" answer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish things were that simple, but they cannot be distilled into that simplicity.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I know that from working with the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Deputy wants to take the floor, that is fine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not a "Yes" or "No" answer. I know this a line the Deputy likes to pursue and is very fond of, but these questions do not have "Yes" or "No" answers. I am also Minister-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These are not "Yes" or "No" answers. What the Deputy insists on ignoring is that I am also a Minister in the Government that awarded record, unprecedented funding to the Arts Council. I am also a Minister in a Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On social welfare supports, the Department of Social Protection stands ready to provide support to those impacted in the short term. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the stakeholders and we will continue to do so to receive feedback on the evolving challenges facing the sector. We have not been found wanting. We will assess the situation and keep it under review.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The most recent analysis I have by the Department of Social Protection was that in September, 533,000 people with a known employer number had returned to work having availed of the PUP. It shows that 62% returned to the same employer, 12% moved to a different employer and 26% moved to a different employer and different activity. Four in ten tourism and hospitality workers on the PUP did not return to their pre-pandemic employers. Some 18,500, or 15%, had moved to a different employer in the same sector while 33,500, or 27%, had moved to a different sector. This summer one in three workers were new to the sector. Up to 40,000 vacancies, 24%, are at senior level. Those are the details I have on tourism.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I really think that is absolutely unnecessary.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A question from a script -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, was something we did. It has had a few iterations. We did it with close consultation from MEAI. The officials examined the specific scheme to which the Deputy referred and felt it was not feasible -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Having said that, we will continue to engage with the arts sector to see if supports are needed. The live performance support scheme of €25 million is available for 2022 -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The officials examined it and felt it was not feasible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have not met with the Minister on this yet but I will meet him in advance of the tourism and hospitality forum to discuss it. As the Deputy can imagine, the current evolving situation with Covid has been taking all our attention where we are assessing and reviewing the supports that are needed. We are seeking to address skill shortages. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge in the sector. Two thirds of businesses have reported reduced capacity. We can see that. I was glad to see the work done by Fáilte Ireland on a new recruitment, marketing and awareness campaign. It continues to promote opportunities and communicate the benefits of working in the industry with its content and social media strategy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This was addressed in the tourism and hospitality forum, which myself -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Myself and the Tánaiste attend that forum. The matter was raised in that forum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did not have to go to him specifically. The stakeholders have a discussion with us as co-chairs of the forum. The idea is that they are talking to both of us at the same time and that the Tánaiste hears what I am hearing at the same time and we both respond.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It was raised at the forum and we responded during the forum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. I will make sure that will happen.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the other issue, I reassure the Deputy that the Secretary General of the Department is a member of the Covid-19 oversight group and the body that makes the recommendations is represented on that oversight group. The Secretary General gets to feed into that process. I would add that dancing is allowed in certain circumstances.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can send the Senator a letter on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, it depends. There are strict regulations on it. I will make sure the Deputy gets the relevant information on that. If one has a relevant licence, the dance-floor space and the event is ticketed, it is allowed. The restrictions are about the layering process. I know the decision on the midnight issue is very tough on the night-time economy in particular. That is what the Deputy is fighting for but at least the sector's doors are still open. Up to two months ago, they had been closed for 18 or 19 months. This is about simply reducing socialisation and the interaction that involves. That is where the decision came from. The doors of the sector are still open and we want to keep them open. I am determined to do that. We will keep the supports in place. That would be my comments on that point.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Comhghairdeas le Maggie Farrelly on being the first woman ever to referee a county final. As the Chairman said, it is shocking that she is the first despite it being 2021. We have a long way to go. Maggie has definitely played her part. As the Chairman knows, young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see. Maggie will definitely inspire young girls to referee in the future. The members should rest assured that the Minister of State and I are absolutely determined to increase the participation of women in all areas of sport, as the Minister of State has outlined in so many ways. We are committed to that. With regard to eligibility for the basic income, a lot depends on the engagement on 8 December at the global café-style event. We are considering the possibility of having two streams, one being for professional artists, most likely based on membership of a resource body such as Visual Artists Ireland or Dance Ireland. That stream would also include emerging artists to ensure developing artists are given the opportunity to develop their creative practice. There would be a second stream for those working in the arts sector who have a creative input into the final output of an artist's practice, such as screenwriters, directors and costume designers. We are considering this. Participation will not be based on a means test; it will be a non-competitive process. We will have a control group, a meaningful number of unsuccessful applicants, so we can capture the important data and determine the impact on both unsuccessful and successful applicants, creative output and artists' well-being. A tender has been issued for a partner to develop the online application portal. Maybe that is what the Chairman was referring to. The key date in the basic income guarantee pilot is 8 December. All the artists issued with invites will get to help to shape the scheme. With regard to Creative Ireland, together with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Arts Council, the programme has seen investment of approximately €13.4 million in the Creative Youth initiative since 2017, with a further €6.8 million in 2021. That will considerably enhance children's and young people's access to creative activities. Three additional education and training, ETB, initiatives are being advanced in Cork, Galway–Roscommon and Mayo–Sligo–Leitrim. The ETBs have been really brilliant at targeting the disadvantaged Responsibility for the decisions on the local Creative Youth partnerships lies mostly with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley. A total of 651 schools have chosen to participate in the Creative Schools programme since its introduction, and a further 299 schools have been chosen to participate in the Creative Clusters initiative of the Department of Education. The current iteration of Creative Ireland is coming to an end and my officials are preparing proposals to extend the programme that I will bring to the Cabinet. Creative Communities, with the local authorities and Creative Ireland, has resulted in incredible work on increasing young people's access to creative opportunities.It has been and will continue to be a real positive.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Go raibh míle maith agat a Chathaoirligh. Tá an-áthas orm fáiltiú ar ais roimh an gcoiste chun tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne a phlé. The Minister of State and I are delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee on strategic priorities for tourism, culture, arts, sport and media. The Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community will address Gaeltacht priorities. Last November when my Department's sectors were among those most seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis, I spoke to the committee about my priorities and the vital importance of these sectors to Irish society, our individual and community well-being and our national economy. I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society. With it, our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead. I am also delighted to see audiences back at arts, culture and event venues and I welcome the full return of fans to our sports grounds. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that there are factors casting a shadow over the recovery, not least the devastating war in Ukraine as well as rising inflation in our economy and internationally. A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, so that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery. I draw the committee’s attention to a number of important developments in relation to these sectors. This year, for tourism, I have allocated an increase of €67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation. The increased funding will facilitate a further €50 million provision to assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until inbound tourism recovers. There is a €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund in 2022 to support marketing strategy and restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Further to the economic recovery plan published last year, the Government decided to extend the VAT rate reduction to the end of February 2023. This extension covers the same goods and services as the original measure, including restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres and museums. I was pleased to announce details of a €50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022. This included a further strand of the live performance supports scheme as well as the €15 million live performance restart grant scheme, which opened for applications in March. The Arts Council provides the vital investment needed to protect artists' livelihoods, support arts organisations, develop audiences and nurture young people’s engagement with and appreciation of the arts. Maintaining the record €130 million allocation for 2022 allows the Arts Council to fund events and festivals in across Ireland while nurturing excellence. From the earliest days of the pandemic, the dramatic realisation of the true intrinsic value of the arts provides an imperative for maintaining funding to the arts. With regard to my Department's capital programme, the programme for Government makes strong commitments for continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure. Ireland's tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits regional development. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. The Department and Fáilte Ireland are continuing to collaborate with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.I am continuing to liaise with the recovery oversight group in respect of the tourism recovery plan and issues affecting the sector. Work is also ongoing on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years and ensure that sustainability is at the heart of recovery in the sector. This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment which includes investment in activity-based tourism. There has been much recent discussion about the costs and availability of key components of the tourism sector, such as hotels and car rental. While I recognise that businesses in the sector are grappling with increased input costs and that increased demand leads to an increase in prices, it is essential that all businesses in the sector are mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its value-for-money proposition as a tourism destination. Evidence of excessive charges and prices for tourists, both domestic and overseas, has the potential to cause reputational damage for Ireland. Furthermore, any negative impact could derail the positive recovery in that sector. We must work together to ensure that our céad míle fáilte and good value continues. The tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable. With the climate emergency as our backdrop, the future we imagine is one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty. Last year, the arts and culture recovery task force submitted its report, Life Worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors. We have made significant progress on implementing the report. I was especially pleased to announce €25 million in budget 2022 for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022, as part of the three-year pilot’s investment of €105 million. Applications closed on the 12 May with close to 9,000 applications received. Under this scheme 2,000 artists and creative arts workers will be provided with €325 per week for three years. I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector and that it will provide an important legacy for our artists. In February, Government also agreed in principle that the Creative Ireland programme will continue for a further five years to encompass the period 2023 to 2027 and will focus on the following pillars: creative youth; creative communities; creative industries; creative health and well-being and creative climate action and sustainability. The report of the night-time economy task force was published in 2021 and contained a number of practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy, with some pilot measures to support new developments in this area. A robust implementation structure has been agreed to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, which has the flexibility to react to new ideas and developments as work progresses. In tandem with these developments, we continue to commemorate in a meaningful and respectful way, the events that shaped the foundation of the state, as part of the decade of centenaries programme. The all-party committee, which I established to contribute to the commemorations programme, is working proactively with me as we come to the closing years of the centenary commemorations, with a number of significant events scheduled over the coming years. It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content. Some examples from budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional €4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which was the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the €5.5 million allocated for the establishment of the coimisiún na meán. I was glad also to be in a position to provide increased funding to the sound and vision scheme which will be allocated this year, to support the production of high quality television and radio content, including a special round to address climate action and climate change. With regard to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I also thank the committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report with regard to the general scheme of the Bill. The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill. To address one of the key recommendations of the report, I established an expert group to examine the possibility of providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. I have now received the report of the group and am considering its recommendations. It is a priority to ensure swift progress of the Bill through the legislative process, with a view to having it enacted as soon as possible. While this is subject to the scheduling of each stage of the legislative process in each House of the Oireachtas, I will urge all Members to work closely with me to expedite its passage, especially against the backdrop of infringement proceedings which are being taken against Ireland in respect of the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive. The enactment of the legislation, without delay, is critical to avoiding significant penalties. In parallel with the passage of the legislation, my Department is working with the Public Appointments Service with a view to shortly commencing an executive search for the key roles in coimisiún na meán including that of online safety commissioner. The establishment of an coimisiún will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to allow me to implement many of the recommendations in the report of the Future of Media Commission, which will be brought to Government shortly. I am sure committee members will agree that all of these measures are critical. I look forward to ongoing cross-party engagement on this important agenda, where I envisage we will require a rolling suite of legislation to address the effective regulation of this hugely important and influential sector. Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and our democracy. As Minister, I will continue to advocate strongly for these sectors as we emerge from a very difficult period. I am happy to take any questions members may have. Is cúis mhór áthais dom deis a fháil labhairt leis an gcoiste inniu.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy, who has raised a significant, highly topical and current issue. As the committee is aware, there are significant cost inflation pressures for businesses, including tourism, at present but nonetheless, as the Deputy has said, Ireland has well-known attractions, many of which are in the Deputy’s own constituency. I think of the beautiful Carlingford which I go to myself and other places which again and again bring visitors back. It is very important that businesses consider both their pricing levels and the added value and extras that they offer to help keep that reputation and that overall good-value proposition and competitiveness. It is important that we attract back customers time and again and that their experience is one where they want to return. On the hotel pricing issue, the 2022 rebound in the Irish tourism sector is very strong and stronger than expectations. It could actually reach two thirds of the 2019 levels. This has been helped by that stronger than anticipated recovery in air connectivity, as the 2022 peak summer access will be back to 90% of 2019 levels.  April occupancy levels in Dublin hotels reached over 83% and the expectation is that the equivalent figure for May will be 90% or more. Dublin is currently seeing at least 10% higher occupancy than cities such as London, Rome or Amsterdam. No one thought that would happen so soon. There is strong customer demand on the ground with a great deal of deferred travel, which is the key part here. There is also the wedding activity, which is putting a real squeeze on available accommodation. Other key domestic factors are also back in play now as we, thankfully, see the resumption of large concerts and matches. We are seeing increasing numbers of those anecdotal reports of excessively high prices in the hotel sector and the Deputy has given examples there in this regard. Whether these reports are reflective of the general market or of the prices that are being sought online for remaining rooms is somewhat moot because, as the Deputy has noted, such reports can have a really negative impact on our reputation as a visitor destination. As I have said, I am very aware that businesses, including tourism businesses, are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors and the hotel-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am just saying that the hotel sector faces a range of challenges, in common with the wider economy, such as the sizeable increase in the cost of key inputs and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining key skills. These challenges are not unique to Ireland. They are shared by many countries around the world. It is very important that Ireland retains its reputation as a value-for-money destination. That reputation cannot be threatened. Value is not just about the price you pay; it is about what you get for the price too.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are two parts to that. There is ongoing engagement with the officials. The hospitality and tourism forum that the Tánaiste and I co-chair will be meeting again. That is a good forum to address the issues. There has been engagement already, but my officials will be meeting with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation tomorrow to consider how value for money can be maintained and how to restrain excessive pricing and ensure that visitors continue to feel that this is a place they want to return in the context of obtaining value for money. The reduced VAT rate applies to a wide range of businesses that need to be considered in addition to the hospitality sector, which are trying to rebuild. They have had a stressful two years. They include catering, restaurant supply companies, cinemas, caterers and museums. The Deputy knows the type of businesses that are on the list. Nonetheless, no potential options should be off the table, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to the protection of the value-for-money perception relating to Irish tourism. That is a critical priority in the years ahead. I think that addresses Deputy Munster's question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of questions there.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What I can say on the future of the media commission is that the discussions are ongoing and a number of Ministers are involved in the report. I continue to talk to the Taoiseach about the issue. I would like to see the matter brought to a conclusion shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Senator knows, the commission was established jointly by me and the Taoiseach. It deals with matters that go beyond the remit of my Department, which is the reason a number of Ministers have been involved in key discussions. That process will come to a conclusion shortly. The programme of work regarding coimisiún na meán is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise needed to lead an coimisiún and to carry out the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. That includes managing the transition of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, staff and functions to an coimisiún while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulations. I touched on the matter a little bit last night in the Seanad. The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage an coimisiún is a priority. Work is under way with my officials and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of those staff. I may have indicated this last night in the Seanad. That includes the executive chairperson and an online safety commissioner. The recruitment will be done through open, transparent and effective public competitions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the regional co-operative marketing fund, Tourism Ireland promotes regional air and sea access to Ireland in overseas tourism markets. A total of €3 million has been allocated to Tourism Ireland in 2022 for the regional co-operative marketing fund. This scheme will continue to form a very important part of Tourism Ireland's plan. The Senator's next question is on Airbnb.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is on Housing for All.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The officials are working in consultation with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Fáilte Ireland on scoping out the legislative provisions that will be required to underpin the system outlined in Housing for All. This is with a view to bringing forward legislative provisions in this regard later in 2022.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No decision has been made on what the Cabinet might or might not do. Nothing has been decided on that. The first stage will be to bring it to the Cabinet. I am happy to discuss the publication of the report with members. The Senator has said we will bring forward a set of proposals.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No such decision has been taken.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The report covers a wide range. The approach the Cabinet will take has not been decided yet. We are still discussing the report with a small number of Ministers. No decision has been taken on the approach that will be taken.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am always happy to discuss any policy matters with the committee. We will see what will happen upon the publication of the report, but I am always available and I hope the committee members see that from the interaction-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am happy to discuss any policy matters with the committee members. Regarding local media, I am conscious of this matter. Another reason to move ahead with establishing coimisiún na meán concerns the supports needed for local media.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a matter I have been considering for some time, but I received the expert group report just this morning. I will have to give it close consideration. The Senator's question is timely. As the Senator can imagine, it is a substantial report because it is a detailed body of work. I am now going to examine the recommendations in detail. In that context, I will be consulting my Cabinet colleagues and the Office of the Attorney General in considering whether and what amendments are required to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil, as I said. Therefore, the report is with me as of today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I intend to publish the report.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I missed the Senator’s last question. I apologise.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will take the question on the Future of Media Commission first, because I have already addressed it. It is our intention to publish that shortly. We are having final meetings about it with the Ministers. As for the basic income for artists scheme, it is the case that I have no statutory function in social welfare means tests. That is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. The participation of artists with disabilities is a matter that I take very seriously. I have sought to ensure that all artists, including those who have a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot. Helplines were established for them so that they could see if they would be impacted. We are encouraging everyone to apply. A key research question that will arise from this entire basic income scheme process will be around the impact that such a payment could have on artists with disabilities. To that end, I was determined since the outset of the basic income for artists scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate. We therefore worked closely with the Department of Social Protection to enable their earnings to be treated as earnings from self-employment and to be taken into account in respect of the earnings disregards that apply to many social welfare payments. That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income that a person in receipt of social welfare payments earns from employment. Not all disabled artists are on social welfare supports, but for those who are dependent on income supports, the issue to which we have referred relates primarily to the manner in which social welfare schemes assess income from other sources. Again, eligibility for social welfare is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, this is all shining a necessary light on this. This will be a key piece that will arise from this research pilot scheme. We have done everything possible to encourage them, as far as we could within the constraints of not being the Minister for Social Protection, in terms of trying to get the basic income for the arts over the line. Of the approximately 9,000 applications that we received, 6.9% of those are from people with a disability. They will therefore be represented on the scheme. They definitely will have a chance to feed into and to be part of the research. I am sure that like other artists, some will be on the control group as well. I have done what I can within the constraints of the scheme and given the fact that I am not the Minister for Social Protection but Minister with responsibility for arts.  In relation to the night-time economy, I acknowledge what the Senator is saying about taxis and how it is not sustainable to have one person in a taxi. On the issue of the eight proposed bus routes, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very supportive of any developments there and in the night-time economy sector. His Department, as well as the various transport agencies, are on the implementation group. I agree fully with the Senator. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is determined to get that done too, from a sustainability point of view.  RTÉ is not funded by the Exchequer, but by licence fee receipts. Therefore, that is a matter for RTÉ to decide on. A portion of the funds from the recent sale of land by RTÉ have been ring-fenced for digital. I think that may include the RTÉ Player. It will also go towards the paying down of debt. I think I have addressed all of the Senator’s questions. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I believe that a portion of the fund from the sale of the land has been ring-fenced by them for the digital and that will include the player.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are engaging with it all of the time. There is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow between our officials, Fáilte Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC. Although the VAT reduction applies to a wide range of businesses, no potential options should be off the table when it comes to protecting our reputation as a value for money tourism destination. That is a critical priority for the years ahead. The demand right now is slightly related to a deferral of many travel plans. It cannot be taken for granted that as we go into the shoulder season and into next year everything will be as it was this year. A lot of people postponed holidays who did not see their families and all of that is coming to a head as we approach summer 2022. We need to be cautious and my officials will be communicating that in the meeting tomorrow.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The basic income pilot for artists will not be means tested because it is not a social protection support. Instead it is a payment in recognition of the time spent in creative practice. We are trialling the basic income pilot and one of the key characteristics of it is that it is not means tested. It will be randomised but it will be proofed to make sure there is proper geographical representation and diversity of arts, population, gender and all of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy knows, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening. I welcome the fact that as we speak the chief executive is up before the Committee on Transport and Communications and a lot of those issues might be teased out there. Dublin Airport is a regulated entity and the Commission for Aviation Regulation is an independent regulator for charges at the airport. It also sets out a comprehensive range of quality standard targets, including on security times, to ensure a high quality service for passengers at the airport. The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling so far short of the service that our citizens, tourists or visitors should expect at our largest State airport. The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers. As the Deputy knows, ministerial level meetings have been held since the security delay issues first emerged at the end of March and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, met the authority earlier this week. They have requested that the DAA report back within 24 hours on solutions that can be put in place as we approach a bank holiday weekend, which is a pinch factor. Up until last weekend queue times had improved on those experienced by passengers at the end of March, with over 90% of passengers getting through security in less than 45 minutes but what we saw last weekend is not acceptable. As the Deputy said, it has a real risk of doing severe reputational damage to our tourism. I have written to the chief executive of the DAA to express my concern and I hope that the recent engagement with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will see immediate solutions put in place because we need that to happen. I am waiting to welcome with open arms the assurances of the smooth operation of Dublin Airport because that is key, as the Deputy has said. What people are seeing on social media and in our newspapers risks doing huge reputational damage to us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I see what the Deputy is saying. That would be more the remit of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, but I will bring that to their attention and suggest that they engage with the DAA on that specific issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the hop-on, hop-off bus, we have engaged with Fáilte Ireland about this. I would like to see the possibility of local transport and tourism transport working together not only for what the Deputy is suggesting but also, for example, because there is major potential at the Cliffs of Moher, too, that would serve the locality as well as providing for tourists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My initial reaction when the Deputy started the conversation by talking about car rental was to say that we need to move to more sustainable modes of transport, but that is exactly where the Deputy is going with that. Regarding car rental, my officials have written to the Car Rental Council of Ireland seeking a meeting to highlight the negative impact on tourism at present. Regarding the sea way, I understand Fáilte Ireland is aiming to complete by the end of the third quarter of this year the procurement process to engage consultants to work with the agency on this project, but I can get my officials to refer back to the Deputy with details about that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have been engaging with the stakeholders on this and I expect to have something shortly on it. We are in the final process of extensive engagement on that. I will not announce what the decision is, but that has been ongoing between the officials and the tourism agencies. Some €5 million in additional funding was secured in budget 2022 to begin the preparations for this project. I hope to bring proposals to the Government in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the basic income for artists pilot, I thank the Acting Chairman for his support for that. I share his enthusiasm for the widest possible participation in it. I also agree with his comments on TG4. I was very happy to increase its funding significantly in the past two years. On the VAT on live performances, currently, artists and live entertainment event workers benefit from a favoured VAT regime but for shows or events where food and drink are not served, VAT is not charged. A lower VAT rate is already applied to tickets for cinemas, theatres, some musical performances, museums and galleries' exhibitions. I understand one of the issues raised by some representative industries is that musicians and performers charge 23% on the fees they charge. There is push on the sector to reduce this amount. I hear their point of view on this and I will make sure I raise it with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for consideration. Regarding short-term lettings, peer-to-peer platforms like Airbnb are an important part of the tourism accommodation mix but we need a range and choice. At the end of the day Housing for All identified short-term lettings as a housing constraint in urban areas especially. Therefore, getting the balance right is key and there will also be stakeholder engagement along with the way.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá an ceart ag gach bean agus ag gach fear go gcaithfear leo le dínit agus le meas. Tá timpeallacht tuillte ag gach oibrí, ina gcaitear leo le dínit agus le meas agus nach ndéantar leithcheal orthu, is cuma faoin gcomhlacht ina n-oibríonn siad nó lena bhfuil siad ar conradh. Creidim go n-aontódh sibh go léir leis sin. Every woman and every man has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. All workers, regardless of the company they work for or who they are contracted to, deserve an environment where they are treated with dignity and respect and are not subjected to discrimination. I believe all the members would agree with that. Ensuring a safe and respectful working environment for everyone working in the arts and in the creative industries is one of the most important issues I have engaged with as Minister. Every person has the right to dignity in the workplace. Damaging behaviours such as bullying, harassment and victimisation will not be tolerated across this sector. Over the past number of years, report after report points to unacceptable behaviours in the arts and creative sector right across the spectrum from inappropriate language and insults to sexual assault and violence.The fact that similar behaviours have emerged in other sectors is cold comfort and I believe it is my responsibility, as Minister with responsibility for culture and the arts, to take action to ensure that such behaviours in the creative sectors are consigned to history. In this important area of work, my Department has partnered with the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI. I am providing funding to the ITI which to date has amounted to €400,000. The ITI has been working in this area since 2017 to undertake extensive research and analysis, assist in the drafting of that, which will respond directly to the key issues, and work with my Department to implement those policies in an effective way that will, I hope, make a real and lasting difference to anyone working in this sector. Last year, the ITI undertook a landmark survey of the arts and culture sector, the results of which led to the launch of the Speak Up: A Call for Change report in November, with five important recommendations. Each of the five recommendations has a range of actions, all of which have been progressed by my Department, in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with agencies, Screen Ireland and the Arts Council. The recommendations include short-term actions, practical initiatives and the longer term challenge of changing mindsets, behaviours and culture. Overall, in working through these recommendations and associated actions, I consider that there must be a fundamental change at a systemic level, which requires a change across society. In helping to achieve this, a comprehensive awareness campaign is under way in combination with practical initiatives, such as bystander training, to effectively tackle sexual and gender-based negative behaviours on the ground. For the past year and a half, I have funded Minding Creative Minds to provide a range of counselling and advisory services to the creative sector, free of charge. Some €530,000 has been allocated to date for this very valuable service and I will continue to fund this into the future. The Minding Creative Minds service is a 24-7 confidential mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and is delivered by Spectrum Life. Over the past six months, my officials have been working closely with Minding Creative Minds to expand its existing services and to incorporate some of the recommendations contained in the report, namely, offering specialised support for victims. Minding Creative Minds is in the process of road-testing these additional services to ensure that practices are up to the necessary standard. I expect this work will be completed shortly and that I will be in a position to make announcements soon. It is very important, in such a sensitive area, that the services are adequately tested before they are rolled out to the public as each and every case may represent a traumatised individual. Appropriate consideration for the victims of these damaging behaviours is vital. Resourcing availability of information is another key focus of the work under way and the Irish Theatre Institute has been working on developing a new website which will incorporate elements of all five recommendations, and will have relevant resources and information available, including sectoral codes of behaviour, policy documents and other toolkits for artists and arts organisations. It will also have an online register whereby organisations can formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to its implementation. This should help to build awareness and transparency across the sector. Screen Ireland is collaborating with the Arts Council to develop bystander intervention training, which should be ready to roll out next month. Screen Ireland is also developing a suite of dedicated online training tools for arts organisations, artists and arts workers. These include self-led training, free of charge, in bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias. There will be additional bespoke elements for particular areas, for example, intimacy co-ordination for stage and screen. It is intended that these will be self-led. It is planned that the basic self-led modules, such as bullying and harassment, will ultimately become compulsory for workers in all organisations receiving grant funding from the Arts Council and Screen Ireland. The Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also introducing a new condition of funding for all recipients of grant funding whereby they must confirm that they have taken all necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour on behalf of a board member or staff members. In the meantime, I continue to engage with stakeholders and all interested groups, as do officials in my Department. I have had many meetings that have been helpful to me and, in particular, I recall Fair Plé telling me that I was the first Minister to engage with it. Most recently, I had a very constructive meeting with members of Safe Arts of Ireland, some of whom gave evidence to this committee. I assured them that I would continue work to implement Speak Up: A Call for Change and would keep them updated in the coming weeks and months. I am pleased that the committee has taken a strong interest in this issue and am happy to take questions from members. Tá dul chun cinn maith déanta again. Tús maith leath na hoibre ach tá bóthar fada le siubhal againn fós. Tá súil agam go mbeidh muid ag taisteal le chéile. We have made good progress but we still have a long road to travel. I hope we will do this together.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Senator is referring to the education system.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In any context, we have to ensure there is safety in the workplace. For example, great work is being done in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, where education and tuition are being provided in traditional Irish music and Comhaltas is the main body doing that. I look forward to the return of the Fleadh in Mullingar. Following the launch, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, which is directly funded by my Department, welcomed the Speak Up: A Call for Change initiative as a timely report and Comhaltas stated its mission as being all-embracing and inclusive of everyone, regardless of race, religion or ability. Comhaltas has its Cothromaíocht: Respect, Equality, Opportunity programme, which details statistically its status in regard to gender balance throughout the organisation. It outlines the delivery of a range of training and mentoring supports, which are vital, as well as resources designed to advance a positive and lasting culture of respect and dignity throughout Comhaltas, which really is an education setting. I welcome that. Comhaltas updated me on that as recently as 13 May. It reported that it had delivered a wide range of training, including modules on a positive working environment and on its gender mainstreaming strategy, as well as reviewing and upgrading its websites and social media platforms.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is important that there should be a place where people can go to register their complaints anonymously and have a sense that they are being taken seriously. This is an initiative that Safe Arts of Ireland talked about and it referred to similar facilities being available in some of our third level institutions, as I know from my engagement with it, and UCD in particular must be noted in this regard. Safe Arts of Ireland has asked for a new independent body to which complaints can be made by non-contracted workers, contracted workers and artists. My Department has been working on this for some months now in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with Minding Creative Minds.Progress is being made, and I am hopeful I will be in a position to make an announcement on that issue in the summer. As for the matter of investigation of allegations of assault, sexual assault and rape, An Garda Síochána is the civil authority in the State for policing and investigation, and that should not change. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has reported that every Garda division in the country now has a divisional protective services unit with specially trained officers available when victims of domestic or sexual violence present to the Garda. As for a place where people can go to register complaints anonymously, I have a sense that that is being taken seriously. It is being progressed in my Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Through the helpline, we hope that experts will be there. We are working on that. As I said in my speech earlier, in anything we have to do we have to be acutely aware of the fact that we are potentially dealing with traumatised individuals, so we have to test everything before we roll it out. Everything is being considered.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Arts Council has informed my Department that recipients of funding must, as a condition of grant receipt, comply with all applicable requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. They must have in place appropriate policies dealing with workplace bullying and harassment. In line with the Arts Council equality, human rights and diversity policy, and in compliance with the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015, they must avoid any form of discriminatory practice and have regard for the need to promote equal opportunities in the area of work. In the event of any board member or member of staff having behaved illegally, wrongfully or inappropriately or in breach of relevant policies and procedures in respect of any person, or in the event of the grant recipient becoming aware of any allegation or complaint that any board member or member of staff has behaved in such a manner, the grant recipient must take all necessary actions in respect of such board member or member of staff to ensure absolutely the safety and protection of such persons and members of the public. The Arts Council will carry out the compliance checks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will have to come back to the Deputy on those exact details. As for the progress that has been made, I hope, by way of progress next month, to be able to launch a range of actions. What I can tell the Deputy about the website is that it will incorporate a code of behaviour, which I think I referred to in an earlier contribution, that organisations in the sector will be asked to adopt voluntarily. The code will include the following broad key principles: zero tolerance of the seven damaging behaviours, along with policies and procedures to maintain the code; published procedures for accepting complaints of damaging behaviour from individuals while protecting them from reprisal or retaliation; timely investigation and resolution of complaints of damaging behaviour; and awareness-raising of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace and roll-out of training using free training resources, ultimately to all workers in the organisation. In due course it will be expected that all organisations that receive or hope to receive funding from the State will adopt the code of behaviours. That is one element of the website that I can share with Deputy Munster. The dedicated website will also incorporate a dignity-at-work toolkit containing comprehensive information on supports and resources for all arts workers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The main step is that continued funding would require grantees to self-certify that they have not had an allegation of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment upheld against them for which a current disciplinary warning or sanction is in place. As Minister, I assure the committee that it is my firm policy intention that organisations that are not found to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams. Damaging behaviour is simply unacceptable. While I fully expect organisations across the sector to embrace this agenda and to respond proactively to the matters raised in the survey, I wish to be crystal clear that where that is not the case, funding is at risk - full stop.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I see what Deputy Munster is saying. That might be well worth considering. As I said, my commitment to this is crystal clear.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Deputy mean the relevant funding agency for-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If, for example, it is the Arts Council that provides the funding, that will be the body in charge. It is whichever body provides the funding. It depends on which body administers the funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Conditionality of funding and dignity at work policy are of the utmost importance. I have been engaging with the various organisations attached to my Department. I have made it crystal clear that I am very committed to this. As I said, I am making it crystal clear that funding is at risk unless this is adhered to. The vast majority of funding of the arts sector, as Deputy Munster will know, is disbursed by the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions. Both agencies have already been very clear in their approach to dignity at work and expectations that dignity at work policies are required for continued funding. They have known from their very first engagements with me early on that I am absolutely committed to this. The Irish Theatre Institute and my Department will continue to work with both agencies on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all members who have commended the work of our Department but the people who deserve credit here are the women who have spoken up so bravely. It was striking. The bravery was remarkable during my engagement with them and I commend them. Things are changing because they spoke up and engaged with us. I mention also the survey done by the Irish Theatre Institute. I want to take a moment to praise these women and commend them on their bravery. I have heard their voices as they bravely told their stories of discrimination and sexual harassment and that is why we are absolutely committed to it. It is a priority. Senator Warfield asked whether we were as rigid as the Arts Council. It is worked into our service level agreement so that absolutely is the case. I do not have the numbers here for those who accessed Minding Creative Minds services but we can come back to him on that. On further surveys, the speak up survey was really the first of its kind. It was made possible because it was funded in its entirety by the Department and carried out by the Department's partners. Since the publication of the report in November, it has been my intention that further surveys will be carried out in line with recommendation five of the report. I will provide funding accordingly. We are already discussing the next round of research. One of the issues will be the marketing of the survey. My officials will be proactive in seeking the assistance of resource organisations such as the national campaign for the arts, in encouraging as many people in the arts and creative sectors to complete the survey. I see the potential in the basic income for the arts pilot as a research project. It might throw up some interesting data on this because it will give artists the independence to say "No". That might come out of the research. They might say they were not comfortable working in a particular area. We can then delve deeper into that. There is potential in the basic income that might reach out to more people in the sector. I think they were all the issues.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus le comhaltaí an choiste as cuireadh a thabhairt dom bualadh libh inniu chun plé a dhéanamh ar an tuarascáil um Choimisiún na Meán. I again thank Professor Brian MacCraith and the other commission members for this insightful and detailed report. A diverse, vibrant and independent media sector is essential for wider society, democracy, cultural development and our social cohesion. Our media enlightens and educates us and facilitates discourse and debate. Its content is a reflection of our society. It is a showcase for our unique culture and heritage and it has the capacity to maintain community bonds. This has never been more clearly demonstrated, and needed, than it was in recent years. However, it is a sector that is undergoing profound change. The Government recognises this and it committed in the programme for Government to establish the Future of Media Commission with a remit to examine how media should serve Irish society, how well the current system meets these goals and what changes ought to be made to improve media in Ireland in the future. The commission's timely recommendations will inform the framework to help the Government to achieve this. The insights the commission's report offers and its recommendations will feed into Government policy and directly impact the future of media in Ireland for the next ten years and beyond. The Government accepted in principle 49 of the commission's 50 recommendations, demonstrating how committed the Government is to supporting the media sector as it transitions to new economic models. With regard to the recommendation to replace the TV licence with a fully Exchequer-funded model, the Government decided that in these challenging economic times, we must balance the needs of the country and economy as a whole. Our decision not to accept this recommendation was based on more than purely economic reasoning. We must also ensure the continued independence of media and it is vital that we maintain a link between the creation and consumption of media content. The Government recognises the need to reform the current funding model to ensure it provides for the new realities the sector faces and, importantly, is sustainable. I have already set up a technical working group that will report to me in November with practical steps to improve the TV licence system to make it fairer and more efficient and sustainable. A cornerstone of the commission's report and recommendations is a regulator with a wider remit to address the shift in media consumption - a media commission. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is progressing through the Oireachtas, provides for the establishment of such a new media regulator, Coimisiún na Meán. A media regulator must now go beyond broadcasting, and an coimisiún will replace the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and have a broader role in relation to media as well as online safety. It will thereby provide the regulatory and developmental framework to implement the commission's report. Two of the initial commissioner roles - the broadcasting commissioner and the media development commissioner - will play a significant role in delivering on the Government's implementation of the Future of Media Commission report. To help Coimisiún na Meán hit the ground running, I secured funding in budget 2022 to enable an early establishment of the new body and competitions to fill commissioner posts are in train. Another key recommendation from the commission is that the broadcasting fund be replaced by a new media fund, with six proposed new schemes added to the existing sound and vision and archiving schemes. While the new fund will need to be underpinned by legislation, I have asked that two schemes be prioritised for development and roll-out in 2023 on a pilot basis. These are the local democracy scheme, which will aim to ensure local media can keep the public informed on areas such as regional health forums, joint policing committees and local authorities, and the courts reporting scheme, which will enable improved reporting from local, regional and national courts. The reform of the licence fee, together with the implementation of the commission's accepted recommendations will enable RTÉ to build on its strengths as our national broadcaster.Through digital innovation and strategic planning, and with the support of NewERA and Coimisiún na Meán, RTÉ will further develop its mission to educate, entertain and enrich the lives of our people in a digital era. Tugaim tús áite don Ghaeilge chomh maith ar leibhéal pearsanta agus gairmiúil. TG4 fulfils a vital role in supporting the Irish language, sport and culture in an innovative way and I was pleased to provide TG4 with additional funding of €4.2 million in budget 2022, building on a substantial increase in 2021, and leaving TG4 better funded than ever before. This has enabled TG4 to continue its innovative approach, extend its reach, support the development of quality content, and highlight key cultural and sporting events and festivals. I very much support the commission’s recommendation that Coimisiún na Meán conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services. Coimisiún na Meán will work with stakeholders to find synergies and build co-operation throughout the sector. Coimisiún na Meán will continue and expand on BAI’s sustainability network to further promote sustainability in the wider media sector. I will also be asking an coimisiún to prioritise the development of new gender equality and equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, standards for the sector to ensure greater representation and content that reflects Irish society today. The recommended diversity and inclusion strategy for sports broadcasting and reporting will help us showcase more diverse sports across multiple platforms. I strongly welcome the commission’s recommendation to develop a national counter disinformation strategy. My Department will lead on the strategy’s development in the coming months. We will work with the Irish hub of the European Digital Media Observatory, industry stakeholders, and with the Tánaiste’s Department, which is overseeing the Digital Services Act. The commission was well briefed on the challenges facing the print sector. The expanded media fund will directly benefit the print sector, especially local media. The proposed local democracy and court reporting schemes I referred to will directly benefit the print sector, in particular local and regional outlets. The commission has also recommended a consideration of indirect taxation measures for the sector, and there will be engagement on this matter in the context of the implementation process. The commission’s recommendations will also benefit the radio sector in the years ahead, both from the widening of the sound and vision scheme to support news content, and from new media fund schemes, such as the media access and training scheme, the community media scheme and digital transformation scheme. The implementation group established by the Government has now commenced its work with the initial task of developing a detailed implementation strategy, which I intend to bring to the Government in November. I will also receive a report from the newly established technical working group on proposals to reform the TV licence system this November. Together with the establishment of Coimisiún na Meán, this will enable the Government to deliver on its commitment to develop a framework to support our media sector for the next decade and beyond. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, aithníonn an Rialtas an gá atá le hathchomhaireamh a dhéanamh ar an múnla maoinithe reatha chun a chinntiú go ndéanfaidh sé soláthar d’earnáil na meán cumarsáide amach anseo. Chuir mé meitheal theicniúil ar bun cheana féin a thuairisceoidh dom i mí na Samhna. Beidh sainchomhartha níos leithne ag Coimisiún na Meán a bhunófar faoi fhorálacha an Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta ar Líne agus na Meán atá ag dul tríd an Oireachtas faoi láthair. Soláthróidh sé an creat chun moltaí an choimisiúin a chuir i bhfeidhm. I thank the committee for its invitation and I look forward to answering members' questions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Future of Media Commission identified a range of challenges in relation to retaining the TV licence system. The commission also considered potential challenges associated with other funding models. As I said, the Government believes that maintaining a direct link between broadcasters and the public is important and reforming the TV licence fee system to make it more equitable and sustainable is the right action to take. There are two reasons; it is about keeping a distance while also considering the context of where we are right now, in challenging times. The Government is not ignoring the commission's recommendations; on the contrary, as Professor MacCraith said at the launch, we have agreed to accept and implement 49 of the 50 recommendations. We absolutely recognise the fundamental societal value of public service content. Irish media has served us extraordinarily well, which we have seen in recent years. However, all funding models are challenging, as the commissioner said, and I believe any new or reformed funding model should retain and build on existing revenues given our current situation, which is from the direct sale of TV licences. That provides an important, direct link between broadcasters and the public. It would also reduce the burden on the Exchequer compared with a model based fully on taxation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The system needs to be more equitable, and it will involve a long-term plan. The technical working group is currently working on the reform of the TV licence, which is a long-term plan. The Government was of the view that to move to an Exchequer-based funding model would raise certain concerns in respect of the independence of media funding. We need to minimise the risk of actual or even perceived political interference in media independence that could arise in a system in which public service media is fully dependent on Exchequer funding, and that was our concern. The report of the commission states that there is no perfect funding model, and that all funding models are challenging, as I said. Any new or reformed funding model should retain and build on the existing revenue available. That is what the technical group is examining and it will report to me in November.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There will be change because the technical group is examining a completely reformed model.The terms of reference look at liability, the database, collection, enforcement and implementation. That group is up and running and is due to report back to me by November. Any interim measures the Deputy is talking about outside of that will form part of the budgetary negotiations over the coming weeks. I have meetings set up and my officials have been engaging with officials in other Departments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a parallel process as well. The technical group is up and running to look at reform of the TV licence but there is also an implementation group. This is exactly what the group will be looking at. It will examine what happens now, the actions that need to be taken and the stakeholder engagement and will come back to me with a plan. The implementation group will take all of that into consideration. That group will also report back to me in November.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. Absolutely.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That report is with me for consideration at the moment. I expect to bring it to Government very shortly. It is imminent. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 is coming before the Dáil next week. That will be followed by Committee Stage a few weeks later. I am aware of the urgency to get the report to the committee. It is with me now and I hope to bring it to my Cabinet colleagues very shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will say "imminent".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would it help to send the committee the terms of reference for both groups?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When I receive the reports in November, and once they are presented to Government, I am sure I can bring them to the committee. Would that help?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. I can arrange for officials to contact the committee on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There were one or two questions in there. On the broader context, I believe that the 49 recommendations that have been accepted in principle by Government and the work that has been done on the reform of the TV licence will put us in a good place. The establishment by the Government of the Future of Media Commission was a recognition that something had to change. As the Senator has said, it has to do with how people now access media. I will point to the media fund. The commission recommended additional funding of €15 million for the new media fund. The detail of that additional funding will be agreed in the context of the budgetary negotiations. I have already engaged with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath's Department in that regard. The introduction of this new media fund will be a significant step towards the support that, as the Senator has said, is needed to allow the media to continue in their vital role, which we all recognise. This is also very true at local and regional levels as well. I refer to local radio and local newspapers. I have asked that priority be given to the roll-out of two of the schemes, the local democracy and court reporting schemes. All of us, and especially those of us who come from rural Ireland, know how important such reporting is, whether on radio or in print. I have asked that work be done on that. I expect that the new Coimisiún na Meán will be in a position to commence these schemes in 2023. The work will start with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. That will ensure reporting on the joint policing committees, the regional health forums, our local authorities and so on. The existing-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Like the commission, I am concerned that RTÉ's financial situation needs to be stabilised. The Government is absolutely committed to our national broadcaster and to helping it operate on a more secure financial footing. NewERA and my Department will continue to engage with RTÉ on its financial situation and the commitment to deliver savings and efficiencies under the revised strategy for 2020 to 2024. I support the commission's recommendation to designate RTÉ as a body to be supported by NewERA under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990. This will guarantee independent oversight of RTÉ's finances. The Future of Media Commission also saw an enhanced role for Coimisiún na Meán in setting targets for RTÉ and monitoring how well RTÉ achieves these targets. I also welcome the commission's recommendation that RTÉ institute a strategic capital asset management plan.This will help RTÉ focus on optimum use of available resources in the medium and long term. Having carefully considered the commission's analysis and recommendations on reforming the public funding model, we agree with its conclusion that the funding model should be reformed. However, we are of the clear view that a move to fully Exchequer-based funding raises certain concerns. That is why we believe that any reformed funding model should retain and build on existing revenue from the direct sale of TV licences. It should minimise the risk of actual or perceived interference and should reduce the burden on the Exchequer. It should be future-proofed, such that revenues will increase-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Much of this will be addressed when I forward the terms of reference of that technical group to the committee but liability in the terms of reference means the extension of liability beyond owning a non-portable television set. It takes into account public possession, burden of proof, enforcement challenges and legal issues. It includes the revenue-generation potential of different options and an assessment of those issues and any issues arising. It covers collection, enforcement and implementation. No decisions have been taken on the database. The technical group is just up and running, is meeting and will come back to me in November. However, I asked for an examination of the data sets necessary to effectively implement that. That means legal obstacles to the sharing of data and potential solutions in this regard as well as the technical and cost requirements for the development and maintenance of an appropriate database and the timescale. I will forward the terms of reference to the committee. The points the Senator has raised there are exactly what we hope this technical group will forensically examine and report back to me.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We also have a meeting scheduled with NewsBrands Ireland next week ahead of the budget. Ultimately, VAT is a matter for the Minister for Finance but I have raised it with him and ongoing budgetary negotiations are happening on those issues and others. We mentioned local democracy and we looked at the court reporting scheme but it is by supporting content we will be supporting print. We looked at the other schemes such as the support for digital transformation and running those schemes. The support for access and training is intended to develop bursaries, internships, diversity training and that presents opportunities for new and existing staff. I believe that will help. The reason this commission was set up was that I could see the crisis that was happening because of the change in access. What has been recommended here will make the difference.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Senator made the comparison of the current funding model of RTÉ and TG4. Both broadcasters receive a mix of public funding and commercially generated revenue. RTÉ receives 37% of its revenues from advertising but TG4 got 10% from this source. As the Senator said, RTÉ's funding comes mainly from the television licence, but TG4 is now funded directly by the Exchequer. TG4 gets its news content directly from RTÉ and that is a slight difference regarding his point about interference. The technical group is working on closing that gap as much as possible. That is its goal in reforming this model.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is a commercial matter outside the recommendations of the commission. I am aware of one broadcaster that is working on that issue with the big tech company. That is outside what we are discussing on the commission. The report recommends an assessment of the impact of the copyright directive. The second group, the implementation group, will look at that. That copyright directive comes under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It recommends that it be implemented as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I seem to recall the Senator raising the RTÉ Player last year. RTÉ has acknowledged publicly that there is room for improvement with that. RTÉ operates in a different environment. The growth of streaming services and on-demand content means that traditional broadcasters need to catch up quickly and meet viewers' expectations. The Future of Media Commission report acknowledged the requirement for increased investment in digital and technological innovation. I agree that RTÉ needs to complete its digital transformation by investing in and improving its technology, particularly streaming services such as the RTÉ Player. To support a number of key strategic initiatives, the organisation disposed of some land at its Donnybrook campus in 2017. The net proceeds of this are ring-fenced for specific purposes, including investment in digital. This will be progressed with RTÉ in the context of implementing the commission's report. Anything else will be met by whatever is already there from our point of view.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The existing archiving fund will remain. The other funds are being added to it. I have not yet met the Minister of State. Today is the first day of the Dáil term. I am sure we will meet; I will probably bump into him today. I can get officials from the arts side of the Department to follow up with the Senator on the other issues he has raised.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The issue the Senator raised regarding the Houses of the Oireachtas reporters is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service. It may be something he could ask a colleague on the commission to raise. I take his point on distribution, although that is probably for the businesses to engage on. He referred to salaries in RTÉ. That is an operational matter and, therefore, it would not be inappropriate for me to say anything on that. Has RTÉ not engaged with the committee on this issue? The Senator raised the recommendation on sport, which I know he has a genuine interest in from our engagement in the Seanad. There are some fantastic recommendations to take away the traditional focus and exploit modern technology to showcase a greater variety of sports across multiple formats and feature people with disabilities or minority sports. Coimisiún na meán, when it is set up, will work with the media organisations, Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport to develop a strategy to promote diversity and gender equality, and examine making sport-related equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, standards a condition of receiving grants from public funding. I strongly believe we need to create more opportunities to showcase greater diversity in sport in Ireland. I am in full agreement with the Senator on that. Again, this is something on which the commission has made recommendations. The setting up of coimisiún na meán will be the perfect enabler of that. The implementation group I have set up will hopefully come back to me in November with the plan for implementation and timeline on how it will be done.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Chairman. As I said earlier, that diverse independent media sector is essential for the wider society and, as she said, our democracy, cultural development, well-being and social cohesion. Its content is a reflection of us as a society.Never have we felt that more than in the last few years. What the Chairman is really talking about is disinformation and I agree with her that it is one of the major challenges to democracy in our era.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have the national counter-disinformation strategy and we have a well of expertise and staff. That is why I welcome the commission's recommendations to develop the national counter-disinformation strategy. The implementation group will consider the strategy because it is examining all of the recommendations, the timelines and the action of that, and I await its report.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In terms of how the two interact with each other, I perceive Coimisiún na Meán as being the body that will help drive the implementation of the recommendations. For example, one of the posts being advertised for Coimisiún na Meán is the media development officer, so he or she will drive the media funding and new initiatives.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Earlier the same question was asked and I said that that is exactly why we have the two working groups of the technical group and the implementation group. The implementation group has been set up in the full knowledge that the technical group is examining how to reform the model. It has taken on board the impact of reform and that decision that was made by Government. That work has been done and is ongoing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, and it will be supplied with the terms of reference.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the terms of reference and liability are being examined by the technical group.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus fáiltím roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an Seanad inniu faoi earnáil na turasóireachta agus faoi na dúshláin atá roimpi faoi láthair mar thoradh ar phaindéim Covid-19. I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad today to speak about the tourism sector and the challenges it is facing as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is right and proper that the primary focus of the Government is on the public health crisis response. Nevertheless, we must ensure that we do our utmost to help our economy to recover from the worst short-term economic shock in the history of the State. The tourism sector has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years and played a leading role in driving the recovery from the last economic downturn. Tourism plays a pivotal role, particularly in rural and regional Ireland, with most earnings retained within the country. Heretofore, as a labour-intensive sector directly contributing to over 11% of employment, tourism has been a leading job creator, supporting 260,000 jobs in 2019 - Ireland's largest indigenous sector. In normal circumstances, tourism provides diverse employment opportunities, including for those unable to work full-time. Tourism also provides employment in rural communities and other economically disadvantaged locations where alternative opportunities can be limited. Approximately 70% of tourism jobs are located in regional and rural areas outside of Dublin. Tourism is a significant exporting sector, with the majority of tourism spending being generated by overseas tourists. In 2019, international tourists spent more than €5 billion in Ireland compared with approximately €2.4 billion spent by residents of Ireland, North and South. Tourism is one of the most directly affected sectors in this current crisis. The impact of Covid-19 on tourism globally has been overwhelming and immediate, with unprecedented consequences for Ireland's tourism industry. Over the past four months, the Irish tourism industry has been decimated. The devastation being experienced in the sector is unprecedented, and I sincerely empathise with those who have lost their jobs or livelihood as a result. Both international and domestic tourism has been very severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. International tourism has collapsed, and the OECD estimates that the impact of the crisis on the tourism industry could result in a 60% to 80% decline in international tourism in 2020, depending on the duration of the crisis and the speed with which travel and tourism rebounds. Ireland's tourism sector is deeply dependent on overseas visitors, who account for 75% of overall tourism revenue. While increased domestic tourism will undoubtedly help make up for some of this, only a proportion of this activity could be expected to be offset by domestic tourism. Fáilte Ireland estimates that a write-down of 2020 overseas tourism business would mean an overall loss to the economy of €2.1 billion this year, with associated job losses of up to 180,000. The July stimulus measures agreed at Cabinet last Thursday are a significant part of our response to the Covid-19 crisis and will help ensure Ireland's businesses get back on their feet and that as many people as possible can return to work when it is safe to do so. The Government is working on a longer-term national economic plan to be finalised in October, but the new supports are critical for the sustainability of the tourism sector and for the Irish economy as a whole over the coming months. They provide vital supports for businesses to retain existing jobs and to create new jobs, and they will help build confidence in consumers and communities throughout Ireland. I worked very closely with my ministerial colleagues in Cabinet, and the measures announced provide much-needed supports to the tourism sector. The new employment wage support scheme will greatly benefit tourism enterprises, especially due to the labour-intensive nature of the sector. Both the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the new employment wage support scheme will run in parallel from 31 July until the temporary wage subsidy scheme concludes at the end of August. This will provide additional flexibility for employers with new hires and seasonal workers who were not previously eligible. The inclusion of seasonal staff and new employees is particularly welcome for the sector, which provides employment to thousands of seasonal staff, especially in rural areas. To help businesses stabilise, reopen and redeploy their staff, enhanced direct grants will be provided from a revised restart grant. This grant was increased and extended, with an additional €300 million in funding being provided. These changes mean that a grant of up to €25,000 is available to more enterprises in the tourism sector. A number of businesses, such as bed and breakfast premises not previously included in the scheme, are also now eligible.I am pleased that the Government found a way to assist the hard-hit bed and breakfast sector. Combined with Fáilte Ireland's adaptation fund, the restart grant will now greatly assist many more tourism businesses. Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on tourism demand. The stay and spend initiative will help stimulate demand in the very challenging shoulder and off-peak seasons. This incentive, which will run for the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021, will incentivise taxpayers to support domestic providers of accommodation, food or both during the off-season, providing much-needed support to a particularly impacted sector. Revenue will provide an income tax credit of up to €125 per taxpayer, or up to €250 for a jointly-assessed married couple for spending on accommodation, food, and non-alcoholic drinks. The tourism and hospitality sector depends on high footfall and businesses are highly aware of the importance of implementing public health measures in preventing the spread of Covid-19. However, the social nature of the businesses means that adapting premises is another expense in a sector that has already suffered more than most. I was therefore very pleased to announce an adaptation fund of €26 million to help tourism and hospitality businesses to cover the costs of adapting their premises to meet public health requirements and make them safer for customers. I am aware of how badly the coach tourism sector has been impacted by the crisis. These businesses are a vital part of Irish tourism and we will need them when our overseas visitors return. That is why I have asked Fáilte Ireland to develop a business continuity scheme to help these businesses through this very difficult period. Fáilte Ireland will now engage with the sector to develop this scheme, which has been allocated €10 million in funding. Further measures which will benefit the tourism sector include the €2 billion Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, the package of liquidity and enterprise investment measures to support small companies and microenterprises, the corporation tax refund, the income tax relief for the self-employed, the warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension of the waiver of commercial rates for a further three months. These measures will supplement the other supports already in place and the excellent work being undertaken by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in supporting the tourism sector in its time of greatest need. The overall package of direct employment supports, cash grants, demand stimulation measures and tax reliefs will make a real difference to the bottom line of tourism businesses right now. I know that the tourism industry has called for other longer-term supports such as a change in the VAT rate. These will be considered as part of the work on the national economic plan in October.  As Senators are aware, the tourism recovery task force is preparing a tourism recovery plan which will include a set of recommendations on how the Irish tourism sector can best adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period from 2020 to 2023. Since it first met at the end of May, the task force has undertaken a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby any sectors and parties with an interest in tourism have been able to provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this economically vital sector can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way. Furthermore, the task force has heard directly from several stakeholders in the past two weeks with a view to informing its deliberations as it works towards a final report. I expect the final report from the task force in the autumn and will carefully consider its recommendations at that time. Fáilte Ireland recently unveiled its new national domestic marketing campaign, Ireland, make a break for it, to the tourism and hospitality industry and it has since gone live across all media. This is a major drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks this summer. I will be taking my family holiday in Ireland in the coming weeks and I encourage anyone who can to take the opportunity to enjoy our excellent tourism offerings. Fáilte Ireland research shows almost nine in ten people want to ensure that the appropriate safety measures are in place if they are to consider taking a domestic break in Ireland this year. Responding to these insights on safety, Fáilte Ireland recently launched a new Covid-19 safety charter, designed to stimulate demand and boost public confidence in the safety of tourism businesses. The charter, which is based on operational guidelines for tourism businesses, is now available to applicants on the Fáilte Ireland website. More than 1,000 businesses have signed up to it so far.According to Fáilte Ireland's research, 60% of people are now planning breaks in Ireland in the next six months. Many intend to extend their short breaks from two or three nights to four nights, and 40% of those who intend to take short breaks booked them in the past two weeks, which is a significant increase on previous numbers. Tourism Ireland is undertaking an extensive Covid-19 programme of research in our major markets to identify when consumers are ready to consider holidaying again and which of our markets offer us the best short-term prospects. This research is considering potential source markets and will then analyse when promotion of the island of Ireland should begin and where marketing should be targeted. The insights gained will ensure that Tourism Ireland's promotional plan is as targeted and motivational as it possibly can be in order to drive a strong recovery for tourism to the island of Ireland as quickly as it is possible to realise it. With regard to international tourism into Ireland, the tourism agencies are guided in all their decisions by public health advice. In line with the advice on non-essential travel, there are currently no paid advertising campaigns by Tourism Ireland in overseas markets about coming on holiday to Ireland. The incidence of Covid-19 has been rising in Ireland over the past two to three weeks. This is aligned with the experience internationally. It is difficult to keep the virus suppressed while also easing restrictions. Overseas travel increases the risk of importing a higher incidence of the virus into the country. In order not to lose the gains we have worked so hard to make, now more than ever we need to stay vigilant and follow public health advice. Everything we are asking people to do is aimed at protecting the vulnerable and ensuring we can get to a point where schools can reopen and vital health services can be resumed. We cannot completely ban overseas travel because we are a small open economy and many people depend on trade for their livelihood. Many people need to travel to and from Ireland to carry out essential functions. There are also essential supply chains from overseas relying on these routes and connectivity to bring food, medicines and other products to Ireland that are critical to our health and for economic activity. Travel is also necessary to allow people to perform essential work, care for family members overseas and return to the country. For that reason, international travel must continue. The agreement reached recently on the €750 billion European Union recovery package represents a very positive step. The package will consist of €390 billion in grants, with €360 billion to be distributed as loans to member states. The eligibility criteria for these funds include objectives that will provide supports for small businesses, tourism, culture and natural heritage, among a range of other areas. I am under no illusions as to the difficulty of the task ahead, particularly with so many competing priorities. At the same time, given the importance of the sector, especially in regional and rural locations, I realise it is critical that we save as many of these jobs and businesses as we can. The July jobs stimulus measures agreed at Cabinet last week, the other supports already in place, together with the assistance being provided by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland will, I have no doubt, save many tourism and hospitality jobs and businesses all around the country. Together with the industry, the tourism agencies and the Department, I look forward to building on our natural advantages and working to ensure the sustainable development of tourism in the coming years.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Seanad Members for allowing me an opportunity to speak today on such an important matter. I thank them for their contributions. I will follow up on as many of the questions raised as is possible. If I do not manage to get back to every query, I will ask my officials to write to the Senators. As I said earlier, the tourism industry in its entirety has been decimated by the Covid-19 crisis. The sector will take the longest to recover. Senator Keogan raised that issue. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by Ireland's tourism industry. I am mindful of its complete loss of earnings, jobs and businesses. I assure Senator Keogan that I am taking this matter seriously. Senator Cassells asked about ancillary job losses. Approximately 260,000 people are employed in the tourism and hospitality sector. I do not have exact figures on the indirect impact of their spending on other jobs. I certainly know that many regions are very dependent on that income. As sports Minister, I understand the desire for larger crowds and attendances at GAA and other grounds. The Government must put health first with everything that comes with Covid-19. If we are ever to reach a point where we can open everything up, then we must act with caution at all times. We have to adhere to the current public advice.If it is at all possible to mitigate the risk to life with bigger crowds, then I am sure NPHET will consider that. My Department will assist NPHET and co-operate with it in that process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senators Gavan, Dooley, Garvey and Conway raised the Shannon Heritage issue. Like many tourism attractions, I am aware of the massive challenges it faces. As it is a subsidiary of Shannon Airport, it is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I will work closely with him on this. He is looking at financial issues with Shannon Airport and will bring recommendations to the Government with regard to these in due course. Fáilte Ireland will be assisting tourism attractions through the adaptation grant. I am aware of the impact this is having on the entire region, as well as how critical it is to it. I will do what I can under my remit to assist with the reopening of these sites. Senator McGreehan spoke about beautiful Louth. She was like an advertisement for the county. I am a frequent visitor to Slieve Gullion and Carlingford Lough. I will be there in the next few weeks, as I often am with my family and friends. Border tourism has already been threatened by Brexit and was a focus for Fáilte Ireland before the Covid crisis. I grew up on the Border. I will be attending the North-South Ministerial Council and liaising with the Minister, Diane Dodds. I will be collaborating and co-ordinating every which way possible. It is a priority. Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are working on joining up initiatives such as the Causeway Coast and the Wild Atlantic Way. I would like to see much more of this. On the Gaeltacht areas to which Senator Ó Donnghaile referred, I have a grá for Gaeilge myself. Last week, I provided €8 million in capital funding to Údarás na Gaeltachta. I want see factories and buildings repurposed and supported to encourage people to stay and work in Gaeltacht areas, helping to build them up. I provided funding under arts to Ealaín na Gaeltachta. I will do whatever I can to support our beautiful language, our native tongue and the Gaeltacht areas. Many Senators brought up the issue of VAT and the voucher scheme. We saw stay-and-spend as the quickest way to get a scheme up and running. It is also more efficient and less costly for a business to administer compared with a redeeming voucher. It has a wide application with up to 2.8 million people being able to avail of it. It is about encouraging demand. The reason that specific timeframe from October to April was targeted was because it is off-season. When I engaged with stakeholders, they said that was when they really needed the support to get them through Christmas. The scheme will not be administratively cumbersome. Some Senators referred to the filing of paperwork involved in the scheme. It will actually be operated through a downloadable Revenue mobile phone app. We envisage one goes to a restaurant or a hotel and one takes a photograph there and then. That is how easy it will be. It was about making it as easy as possible to support our restaurants, coffee shops and hotels. At the level of individual taxpayer, the relief on accommodation and food, including soft drinks but not alcohol, it is a minimum spend of €25 per person per time with a maximum spend limit of €625 over the lifetime of the scheme. The taxpayer will take the photograph. One will get 20% of the voucher costs through the income tax maximum credit of €125 per person. The tax credit may be set against a claimant's USC liability where he or she does not have a sufficient income tax liability to fully absorb the tax credit in the year of assessment.Senators Garvey and Conway spoke of the lights of the Banner county. I can let Senator Garvey know that my family will be going there in the next few weeks. We will go to Clare and are looking forward to it. We intend to spend a lot of time there, we are walkers and my husband and I look forward to exploring the Burren with our three children. I look forward to meeting the Senator in person when I am there.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senators Martin, Wall and O'Loughlin mentioned Kildare. With family there, I am a frequent visitor to Kildare. I have friends and colleagues there also. I enjoyed working closely with Senator O'Loughlin and I look forward to a tour of Kildare. On the bogs and stud farms and if they should be opened up, Fáilte Ireland has a tourism capital fund that has developed many similar attractions, for example, in the Lough Boora park in the midlands. Senator Boyhan commented on Carrickmacross. I am happy to meet him for a coffee and recommend the sights and thrills of my native home town. Senator Blaney referred to North-South tourism. The national maritime park is part of the brief of my colleague in transport, but I will bring that to his attention. Senators Conway, Dolan, O'Reilly and D'Arcy referred to greenways. An investment of €23 million has been allocated this year for tourism-focused greenways. Senator D'Arcy spoke on a specific project. Anything we can do to encourage cycling and to make cycling safe in this regard, is of course a priority for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Senator Wall referred to coach tourism. I have asked Fáilte Ireland to develop a business continuity scheme to help these businesses through this difficult period and €10 million has been made available under the July stimulus programme for this purpose.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to VAT, all options were considered for the July stimulus package but we were trying to focus really quickly - we had three weeks - on the jobs and getting people safe and secure, such as with the wage subsidy scheme, and making sure that seasonal workers were brought in. We did that. All options were considered with regard to VAT and all options will be reviewed as we come into the October package. If there are any other issues I have not addressed here, as a lot were raised, my officials will get back to the Senators. With the tourism-specific and wider economic measures announced in the July stimulus programme I really hope I worked hard with my ministerial colleagues to prioritise this sector. I understand the concerns of those who want more longer-term measures, and that is what I will focus on now. This is just the start. Last week's July stimulus package and the longer-term national economic plan will be launched in October. I will work on ensuring the tourism sector's voice is heard loudly and clearly in the deliberations on that plan. Working together with Government and the industry I am confident in our ability to overcome the difficult challenges that lie ahead.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for raising this important matter in a period when Covid-19 has effectively closed down the arts and culture sector. The restrictions have severely affected the livelihoods of many artists and creative workers. The limitations on indoor and outdoor events, social distancing and travel restrictions have had a severe impact on the arts, culture, live entertainment and events, with grave consequences for those working in these sectors. Many careers that have taken decades to build are now threatened and in serious jeopardy. At a broad level, the Government has already responded to the challenges facing the sector through a number of recent measures, which the Senator mentioned. Considerable additional funding was secured for the sector in the context of the July stimulus, culminating in such events as the stunning performance this weekend of Happy Days by Landmark Productions at the Olympia Theatre. I do not know whether the Senator saw it. Further significant additional funding was announced in budget 2021, with €130 million added to the Arts Council budget for 2021 and €50 million made available for supports for live performance. Tens of millions of euro in support has been provided to those impacted in the arts, culture, performance and events sector through the pandemic unemployment scheme and various wage subsidy schemes. The arts and culture recovery task force report to which the Senator referred, entitled Life Worth Living, outlines ten recommendations for the sector. These include a proposed mechanism for the rolling out of the universal basic income, UBI, through the establishment of a pilot project that would last three years. In addition to the recommendation of the task force, there is, as the Senator said, a prior commitment in the programme for Government to assess a pilot UBI — one that is informed by a review of previous international models. This matter is now being considered in the context of the national economic plan being developed by the Department of the Taoiseach, and it will ultimately be a matter for consideration by the Low Pay Commission. The rationale behind the recommendation to introduce a basic income pilot is to create a more stable social protection mechanism to allow artists and events workers to sustain themselves during the pandemic and to take up work when it arises without losing existing social protection supports. Many creative practitioners and allied workers are freelance, moving frequently between self-employment, PAYE employment and periods of no employment at all. The pattern of low-paid and insecure employment has been exacerbated by the inevitable changes and uncertainties arising from the implementation of the recommendations in Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. The pilot UBI could act to keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits, social, economic, local and national. UBI encourages entrepreneurship as people who are in receipt of it can take on work and earn additional taxable income on top of it. The arts sector represents an appropriate area for a UBI pilot scheme for the following reasons. It is characterised by low and precarious income. It involves significant positive externalities. It includes a broad mix of employment types, and it has been chosen for UBI pilots in other jurisdictions, allowing international comparisons to be drawn, just as the Senator referred to what happens in France. The task force also recommended an interim extension of the professional artists on jobseeker's allowance scheme. The current scheme acknowledges the status of self-employed artists as professionals, giving them a 12-month window to focus on building up their work before becoming subject to labour market activation.They are exempted for a year from the activation process which is mandatory for most jobseeker's allowance recipients. This scheme gives important support to professional artists who lose their employment and serves a different purpose from the UBI. On a personal level, after a considerable amount of time and energy from the Green Party's negotiating team, I was delighted to secure a commitment in the programme for Government to a pilot UBI initiative. UBI has been a core policy of the Green Party since the party's foundation. The Government obviously involves three political parties. Needless to say, the Senator is very much pushing an open door with me when it comes to the introduction of UBI in Ireland. Perhaps he could assist to ensure his focused enthusiasm for the UBI is replicated across the other parties in government, and delivery of this programme for Government commitment is not only realised but strengthened.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I would love to be able to pursue this issue, it will not come from my Department. My role is to advocate for it strongly. I know the sector and the arts community are aware I am doing that. The recommendation for a pilot universal basic income is a very exciting proposal. UBI was never to be seen as a handout and I definitely do not see it as such. That goes against the very nature of a UBI. As I said, this pilot UBI reflects the commitment in the programme for Government. I want to see it thoroughly examined. That will happen in the context of the national economic plan. The proposal is now being considered in that context. It is being developed by the Department of the Taoiseach and will ultimately be a matter for consideration by the Low Pay Commission. There are, however, clear reasons that the arts and culture sector would be the right sector for such a pilot. Financial stress can impede creativity. The unconditional nature of a universal basic income is one of the key features that supports creativity and innovation. As the Senator knows, the scheme has been well received and has been the subject of much positive commentary both nationally and internationally. We are working now to see how it can be enhanced. I will also shortly establish the oversight group for the implementation of the recommendations of the task force. It, too, can have a role to play.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith leis na Comhaltaí inniu mar Aire Turasóireachta, Cultúir, Ealaíon, Gaeltachta, Spóirt agus Meán chun clabhsúr a chur leis an díospóireacht seo. Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú chun labhairt faoi Lá Idirnáisiúnta na mBan inniu. Tá sé mar phríomhsprioc agam, mar bhall den Rialtas, comhionannas inscne a chur chun cinn i ngach réimse faoi mo chúramsa. Táim tiomanta do chumasú na mban. Tuigim gur féidir liom cabhrú le glórtha na mban a ardú agus tacú le comhionannas in earnálacha cosúil leis an spórt, leis an gcraoltóireacht, leis na healaíona, leis an scannánaíocht agus ar ndóigh, sa Ghaeltacht.Agus muid ag ceiliúradh Lá Idirnáisiúnta na mBan i mbliana, ba mhaith liom gealltanas a thabhairt arís go nglacfaidh mé go fonnmhar le mná i róil cheannaireachta i ngach réimse, agus go dtabharfaidh mé tacaíocht dóibh sna róil sin. Tá sraith thionscnaimh ghníomhacha ar siúl ag mo Roinn agus a cuid gníomhaireachtaí, lena n-áirítear comhpháirtíochtaí sa cheol, sa spórt, sa scannánaíocht, sa chraoltóireacht agus sa Ghaeltacht. Le déanaí, d’ainmnigh mé féin agus an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, ceathrar ban do bhord Fhoras na Gaeilge, mar shampla. Bhí beirt cheapaithe nua, Neasa Ní Chiaráin agus Ola Majekodunmi, i measc na gceapaithe seo. Níos déanaí an mhí seo, labhróidh mé ag ceardlann a reáchtálfaidh an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí. Tá sé mar aidhm ag an imeacht seo pobal imirceach na hÉireann a spreagadh chun cur isteach ar cheapacháin bhoird. Táimid tar éis dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh i mo Roinn maidir le comhionannas inscne a chinntiú ar bhoird i réimse an chultúir. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an comhionannas seo ar fud na Roinne agus ina cuid gníomhaireachtaí. Go deimhin, is í an Ghaeilge ceann de na rudaí is sainiúla faoinár gcultúr. Táim ag obair leis an Roinn chun saibhreas na Gaeilge a léiriú inár gcuid gníomhaíochtaí cultúrtha go léir. Sa chomhthéacs sin, ba mhaith liom an deis a thapú labhairt leis na Baill faoi chuid de na forbairtí spreagúla atá ag tarlú faoi láthair i saol na n-ealaíon Gaeilge a bhfuil baint ag mo Roinn leo. Léiríonn pobalbhreith i ndiaidh pobalbhreithe sa tír seo go bhfuil grá ag tromlach phobal na hÉireann, agus mise ina measc, don Ghaeilge. Le linn m’óige, chaith mé bliain i gColáiste na Rinne agus tréimhse eile i Ros Muc ag foghlaim na teanga, agus ag titim i ngrá léi. Thug sé seo léargas agus tuiscint dom ar an nGaeilge mar theanga bheo i measc na bpobal Gaeltachta seo. Cuireann sé díomá orm nár éirigh liom dul ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht i mo ról mar Aire fós de bharr na paindéime ach tá sé i gceist agam é sin a chur ina cheart a luaithe is a bheidh an dianghlasáil thart. Is linne uile an teanga agus tá an spéis atá ag pobal na tíre inti ag fás an t-am ar fad. Tá sé seo le feiceáil san éileamh atá ar an oideachas lán-Ghaeilge faoi láthair. Tá sé le feiceáil chomh maith sa mhéadú ar líon na seirbhíseach poiblí atá ag tabhairt faoi ranganna Gaeilge leis an gcomhlacht Gaelchultúr le cúpla bliain anuas. Ar ndóigh, ní leor dea-mhéin chun caomhnú na teanga a chinntiú. Tá gníomh ag teastáil agus, mar Aire, tá mise tar éis cúpla gníomh simplí a thógáil le haitheantas a thabhairt don bhorradh atá faoin teanga faoi láthair. D'iarr mé ar oifigigh mo Roinne an Ghaeilge a chur san áireamh mar inniúlacht inmhianaithe agus ceapacháin do gach bord Stáit faoi chúram na Roinne á mbreithniú. Anuas air sin, agus muid ag ullmhú ráiteas straitéise nua na Roinne faoi láthair, d’iarr mé go mbeidh forbairt na Gaeilge sa státchóras mar chuspóir trasghearrtha sa cháipéis. Is soiléir go bhfuil borradh tagtha ar an bpleanáil teanga le roinnt blianta anuas agus tá na healaíona lárnach sa phróiseas sin. Is í Ealaín na Gaeltachta an eagraíocht is mó a luaitear le cúrsaí ealaíon sa Ghaeltacht. Aithníonn siad na healaíona traidisiúnta, go háirithe an drámaíocht, an scríbhneoireacht, an ceol agus na healaíona béil, mar bhealaí chun an Ghaeilge a spreagadh agus a chur chun cinn. Tá láithreacht náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta ag an eagraíocht agus naisc aici le heagraíochtaí ealaíon ar fud na tíre agus le heagraíochtaí atá ag feidhmiú i dtíortha eile ina bhfuil mionteangacha á labhairt. Is comhpháirtíocht í Ealaín na Gaeltachta idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an Chomhairle Ealaíon agus déanann an dá eagraíocht an comhlacht a cómhaoiniú. Tá áthas orm go bhfuair mo Roinn deis tacaíocht a chur ar fáil don togra Fighting Words a bhunaigh Roddy Doyle chun leagan Gaeilge de a chur ar bun. Is tionscadal teagaisc agus meantóireachta don scríbhneoireacht chruthaitheach saor in aisce é atá á fhorbairt ar fud na tíre do dhaoine óga. Bunaíodh Fighting Words trí Ghaeilge i gConamara in 2019 agus tá sé lonnaithe in Ionad Cultúrtha an Phiarsaigh i Ros Muc. Cuireann an tacaíocht bhreise atá curtha ar fáil ag mo Roinn ar chumas na heagraíochta ceardlanna agus cláir Ghaeilge a fhorbairt atá tairbheach do dhaltaí na Gaeltachta. Mar cheanneagraíocht de chuid Fhoras na Gaeilge, tá Oireachtas na Gaeilge freagrach as deiseanna a fhorbairt a thacaíonn le húsáid na Gaeilge. Is é Oireachtas na Samhna mórfhéile na heagraíochta, agus mar is eol dúinn, ar an drochuair, níor tionóladh Oireachtas na Samhna i nGaillimh anuraidh de bharr na pandéime.Ba mhór an trua é nach raibh deis againn teacht le chéile agus ár dteanga, ár gceol, ár ndamhsa agus ár siamsaíocht a chleachtadh agus a cheiliúradh ach rinneadh sárobair chun clár leathan imeachtaí a eagrú go fíorúil. Tá súil agam nach fada go mbeidh an fhéile spraíúil seo ar ais ar an bhfód arís mar is é is mó a spreagann muintir na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge le teacht le chéile gach uile bhliain ar mhaithe leis na healaíona teangabhunaithe a léiriú don tír uile. Tá obair na gcapall déanta ag an gCumann Scoildrámaíochta thar na blianta le páistí a spreagadh ar fud na tíre agus iad ag glacadh páirte sa drámaíocht trí Ghaeilge. Eagraíonn an cumann féilte drámaíochta ar fud na tíre agus tugtar cuireadh do bhunscoileanna, d’iar-bhunscoileanna agus do chlubanna óige ar fud an oileáin, Thuaidh agus Theas, páirt a ghlacadh iontu.  Mar a fheictear, tá céimeanna dearfacha tógtha chun saol na Gaeilge a neartú agus a shaibhriú ó thaobh na n-ealaíon de. Tá acmhainní suntasacha á gcur ar fáil ag an Rialtas don Ghaeilge ar bhonn leanúnach tríd mo Roinn agus trí Ranna agus comhlachtaí poiblí eile agus tá pobail ó cheann ceann na tíre ag obair go dian dícheallach leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn ina gceantair féin. De bharr brú ama inniu, níl luaite anseo agam ach roinnt de na bearta atá ar bun. Níor cheart dom dearmad a dhéanamh, mar shampla, ar an obair iontach atá á déanamh ag Foras na Gaeilge chun léamh na Gaeilge a spreagadh agus a fhorbairt. Ní nach ionadh go mbeadh léamh na Gaeilge chomh tarraingteach sin leis an móroidhreacht litríochta atá fágtha ag a leithéid de Mháirtín Ó Cadhain, Máirtín Ó Direáin, Johnny Chóil Mhaidhc Ó Coistealbha, Seosamh Mac Grianna agus Joe Steve Ó Neachtain, a d’imigh ar shlí na fírinne díreach breis agus bliain ó shin.  Tá obair ar bun ag mo Roinn le tamall anois i dtreo straitéis do na healaíona teangabhunaithe a fhoilsiú, straitéis atá á hullmhú ag mo Roinn i gcomhar le páirtithe leasmhara. Táimid ag tabhairt faoin obair seo chun go mbeifear in ann pleanáil níos fearr a dhéanamh chun tús a chur leis na bealaí a d’fhéadfaí breis tacaíochta a thabhairt do na healaíona teangabhunaithe amach anseo.  Cé go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta a bhfuil ar ár gcumas a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, tá todhchaí na teanga ag brath go mór ar an bpobal. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga. Tá orainn timpeallacht a chothú ina mbraitheann daoine muiníneach as a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid, is cuma cén leibhéal cumais atá acu inti. Is de réir a chéile a thógtar na caisleáin ach tá mé cinnte de go bhfuilimid ag dul sa treo ceart. Níl ansin ach blaiseadh d’obair mo Roinne agus eagraíochtaí eile chun an teanga a fhorbairt agus a chur chun cinn in earnáil na n-ealaíon. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teach arís as an deis a thabhairt dom labhairt anseo agus leis na Seanadóirí uile a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht inniu: na Seanadóirí Mullen, Clifford-Lee, O'Loughlin, Ward, Sherlock, Ó Donnghaile, Ardagh, Murphy, Buttimer, O'Reilly, Conway agus Garvey. Ardaíodh an iliomad cásanna le linn na díospóireachta, ina measc cúrsaí oideachais, an Ghaeilge sa Tuaisceart, cúrsaí craolacháin, na coláistí samhraidh, Údarás na Gaeltachta, cúrsaí baincéireachta, Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2019 agus ceisteanna eile nach iad. Pléifidh mé iad le mo chuid oifigeach agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuig na Seanadóirí áit gur cuí.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim an-sásta a bheith anseo inniu ag labhairt leis an Teach faoin turasóireacht. I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad about the plans for supports and incentives for the tourism and hospitality industry for 2021. In 2019, before the pandemic had wrought its affects on Irish society, tourism was worth more than €9 billion in total to our economy from overseas tourists and the fares they generated together with domestic tourism. The industry supported 260,000 jobs across the country both in remote rural areas as well as in our towns and cities. Since the advent of Covid-19, and the consequential and necessary public health measures, many of these jobs have been lost or are surviving with State support and income from the sector is a fraction of what it was in 2019. I am very aware of the toll that the pandemic and the restrictions are continuing to take across the sector and, most importantly, on the people working in the industry. It was critical, therefore, that the Government recently extended the economy-wide supports for businesses and employees until the end of June. As Senators will be aware, the Government has also committed that there will not be a cliff-edge end to the supports that are currently in place. We remain committed to supporting tourism through this difficult period, and to working towards reopening and recovery. In that regard, the Government will soon publish a national economic recovery plan, which will outline how we will help people return to work, support sectors that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and how emergency supports will be phased out. Crucially, as part of that plan, along with my colleagues in government, we will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors such as tourism that will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. While we collectively continue to experience the dreadful impact of this pandemic on life, society and the economy, there is cause for cautious optimism as the roll-out of the vaccination programme gathers pace. Reopening tourism businesses and managing the recovery in a way that is economically viable, safe and attractive for tourists and local communities will require co-ordination at a level not seen previously. The roadmap to recovery will require flexibility, agility, investment, innovation, and a commitment to a strong collaboration with the industry. Horizontal support schemes such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and rates waiver have been worth hundreds of millions of euro to the broader tourism and hospitality sectors. Outside of that, I have allocated a record level of funding to tourism, which has allowed me to introduce measures specifically aimed at assisting the tourism sector, such as the €55 million business continuity scheme launched on 1 February by Fáilte Ireland to help strategic tourism businesses survive the pandemic and drive recovery. This scheme will contribute to the fixed costs of identified tourism businesses that are not eligible for the CRSS to support their survival. It will provide an equitable level of payment to the CRSS for qualifying businesses and the first phase will cover businesses such as tourism attractions, activity providers and caravan and camping sites. The VAT rate for the sector was reduced to 9% to help improve the competitiveness and viability of businesses. Two separate funds of €10 million each were introduced for coach tourism operators and the Ireland based inbound agents business continuity scheme in the last quarter of 2020. In addition, €8 million in restart grant funding was provided for bed and breakfast premises. Funding of €5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence. A €26 million adaptation fund has been provided for the tourism sector to adapt their premises to meet Covid-19 safety requirements. Survival is the first part of the Government's response for tourism. Recovery must come next. I will continue to keep all options open for supporting the recovery. Last September, the tourism recovery task force submitted a recovery plan to me which set out a number of recommendations aimed at helping the tourism sector to survive and recover from the pandemic. The plan has been a very important input into my thinking on the sector and has influenced a number of the measures I have adopted.  I subsequently appointed the recovery oversight group in December to monitor the implementation of the recovery plan. The oversight group was ably chaired by Nóirín Hegarty and she presented the group's first report to me on 15 February. The report highlights a number of areas on which it recommends the Government should focus its attention. I brought this report to the attention of my colleagues in government to ensure they are fully up to date with the position on tourism as we prepare the national economic recovery plan. A number of the areas highlighted by the group have already been addressed in our new Covid plan, The Path Ahead. In addition, my officials will continue to engage with tourism agencies and colleagues across government in pursuing progress on specific recommendations. I will keep the content of the report under review, together with the initial recovery plan produced by the tourism recovery task force, as the situation evolves. Last October, the Tánaiste and I convened the hospitality and tourism forum to provide a platform for structured engagement between the hospitality and tourism sector, the tourism agencies and relevant Departments. The forum enables the Tánaiste and me to engage with a wide spectrum of industry stakeholders to assess the continuing impact of the pandemic, help improve understanding and responses to the crisis and discuss ideas for recovery measures, thus assisting the Government in formulating its ongoing response to the crisis. I was pleased that the Taoiseach also attended the most recent meeting of the forum earlier this month to hear at first hand of the devastation this pandemic has brought to our tourism sector and the many challenges the industry now faces. I am committed to mapping a pathway for the recovery of the sector and I will continue to work with all stakeholders in that regard. It is recognised that during periods of closure the tourism and hospitality sector is losing skilled staff to other sectors. The tourism recovery task force identified that retaining tourism jobs and skills will be vital to tourism's recovery and implementing an upskilling and reskilling programme can mitigate the significant damage the crisis is having on the sector. In this regard, supporting the retention will be assisted by measures such as the funding of €5 million provided in budget 2021 for upskilling training and to improve digital presence. The tourism and hospitality careers oversight group is a collaborative approach by stakeholders, including industry bodies, education providers, Departments and State agencies, to addressing skills shortages in the tourism sector. The group is finalising a new plan which includes input from members and a review of its collaborative framework, and takes into account recommendations from the tourism recovery task force. The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State with responsibility for skills, Deputy Niall Collins, recently announced two new skills programmes to assist the hospitality and tourism sectors with Covid-19 challenges and ensuring they are ready for reopening. Looking ahead to the summer, indications are that there will be a strong domestic demand for tourism services when it is safe to open up.Recent CSO figures show that almost 70% of people intend to take a holiday in the Republic of Ireland in 2021. While this news is encouraging, I am very conscious that the tourism sector relies heavily on international tourism. The industry wants certainty around when international visitors can visit, but it is not helpful to speculate on specific dates at this point. The path ahead makes clear the criteria which are most important when considering the easing of travel restrictions. These are the prevalence of the disease and the attendant reproductive rate, reducing hospital and critical care occupancy to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-Covid-19 care, ongoing and steady progress in the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination, and emerging information on variants of concern. International travel is critical for tourism, with overseas visitors accounting for 75% of the revenue generated by the sector prior to the pandemic. At this point, the Government’s overarching and primary policy objective on inbound international travel is to minimise the introduction of new cases of Covid-19 to the State from other locations. A senior officials group continues to review the situation fortnightly. This group, having regard to the developing epidemiological in the State and internationally, the evolution of tests and technologies, and progress been made in the vaccination programme, will make every effort to reopen international travel at the earliest possible opportunity. Unfortunately, inbound international tourism is not possible at present given how the pandemic has evolved. It is too early to say when it might resume, but I look forward to seeing people back visiting our country when it is safe to do so. At a meeting of EU tourism ministers on 1 March I urged the European Commission to consider initiatives to facilitate the resumption of safe international travel. In that regard the proposal for a regulation on digital green certificates announced by the EU last week is a welcome development. It is vital, however, not to raise hopes about a quick return to international tourism. Most EU member states are still working hard on their domestic messaging to encourage citizens to stay the course with restrictive measures, many of which remain necessary pending the roll-out of the vaccination programmes. The priority in Ireland is on regaining and maintaining control over the disease and preventing a further wave of infection later in the year until vaccination can offer a widespread population level of protection. The EU’s proposal of a common framework for the issuance verification and acceptance of certificates relating to vaccination, testing and recovery requires careful consideration. The proposal is expected to be discussed at the European Council meeting of leaders later this week and will be examined in detail by relevant Government Departments. It is too early, therefore, to comment in detail on that proposed framework. I wish to assure the Seanad that I am fully aware of the great challenges faced in tourism and that I will continue to work with my colleagues in Government to ensure the sector is given every possible support to enable it to emerge intact from the pandemic and to build back in a more resilient, digitalised, greener and sustainable way. We will do that as we have done since I became Minister, which is in constant consultation with the stakeholders.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their statements today and the passionate support demonstrated for the tourism industry. As Minister with responsibility for tourism, allow me to re-emphasise that I am acutely aware of the devastation that Covid-19 is inflicting on the sector. I am also very aware of the havoc it has caused for the hundreds of businesses and thousands of workers in one of our most valuable indigenous industries. In my many engagements with tourism stakeholders we continue to focus on key supports for survival and recovery. My colleagues and I across the Government have reiterated there will not be a cliff-edge end to the supports currently in place. I will do my best in the time allocated to answer as many specific questions but if I do not get to one, Senators should feel free to contact me and I will get answers to any Senator making that request. Senators Garvey and McGahon raised the question of sustainable tourism. My immediate focus is on the survival of our tourism sector but we must begin planning for recovery and rebuilding when the time is right. I absolutely agree with Senators that there is an opportunity here to address sustainable tourism development in a much more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following this crisis. Sustainable development is about using without exploitation our natural, cultural and other tourism resources, preserving them for use by future generations. It also means tourism should be a positive for local communities, as Senator Garvey mentioned, tapping into and supporting local food producers. It makes sense, as well as being economically sustainable. With that in mind we must seek to realise Ireland's ambition to be among the world leaders in sustainable tourism practices. As Senator Garvey indicates, biodiversity can play a significant part in tourism. A sustainable tourism working group was established prior to the Covid-19 outbreak and it produced a set of guiding principles for sustainable tourism development in Ireland. I have now charged this group with the development of a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices. The implementation of these actions, along with the guiding principles we have produced, will underpin the advancement of a new tourism policy that will mainstream sustainability. In due course and when the time is right, officials in my Department will initiate the development of this new national tourism policy. Senator Keogan asked what progress has been made in supports and I outlined earlier some of those supports, including: the €55 million business continuity scheme; the reduction of the VAT rate to 9%; two separate funds of €10 million for coach tourism operators and the Ireland-based inbound agents business continuity scheme; an €8 million restart grant; €5 million for upskilling; and a €26 million adaptation fund. There are also horizontal supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme and rates waivers worth millions of euro to the broader tourism and hospitality sectors. The tourism recovery oversight group presented its report to me early this year but the tourism recovery task force included representatives from the hotel and hospitality sectors. Senators Casey and Wall mentioned the stay and spend scheme, which was set up late last summer to provide targeted supports to accommodation and hospitality businesses most affected by continued restrictions. At the time the scheme was devised and launched, there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that at the very least there would be a partial reopening of the sector that could be sustained. It was set up by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and it was an innovative approach to incentivising spending on the tourism and hospitality sectors. Public health conditions that were beyond our control have clearly prevented that and the stop and start nature of the pandemic, along with its unpredictable consequences, resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised.There are effective supports in place. I mentioned the CRSS and the €55 million for strategic tourism businesses. This specific scheme should be reviewed, as provided for when it was launched. The review of the scheme was a recommendation of the recovery oversight group and I have urged Cabinet colleagues to give serious consideration to this and other recommendations of the report to facilitate the reopening of the sector. Senators Cassells, Blaney and Burke mentioned the pathway and when sectors will be able to open and have that information. I am conscious that the hospitality and tourism sector wants certainty around this but I cannot give specific dates at this point. Covid-19 Resilience & Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, which we published recently, makes clear the criteria which are most important to consider regarding the easing of restrictions. Those criteria are: the prevalence of disease and the attendant reproductive rate; reducing the hospital and critical care occupancy to low levels to protect the health service and to allow for resumption of non-Covid care; the ongoing and steady progress of the vaccination programme; and emerging information on variants of concern. I will continue to engage with sectoral stakeholders on this as we move towards the summer. I want the sectors to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so. The Government is absolutely committed to developing a clear roadmap for return and we will meet in advance of 5 April to review the restrictions. Senator Keogan mentioned the vaccination roll-out. We are prioritising that roll-out. We are only constrained by supply and are working to increase that supply. Projected deliveries in April to June give us some optimism that we should be able to hugely expand the programme. I am sure everyone here would agree that would be very welcome. The Senator also asked what exactly has been implemented from the report. There has been the extension of EWSS, the introduction of CRSS, the Fáilte Ireland inbound agents and coach tourism operators schemes, the tourism business continuity scheme, the rates waiver, tax warehousing and, as I said, the 9% VAT which was agreed in the last budget. Senators Carrigy, Cassells and Wall mentioned the outdoor scheme with Fáilte Ireland working with assistance from local authorities to help this industry. The pandemic has triggered discussions around reimagining our cities and towns as better places to live, work and visit. Local authorities and State agencies have been responding to this promptly and thoroughly. Public health guidance is likely to place restrictions on capacity across tourism and hospitality for the foreseeable future, with a much greater focus on utilising outdoor settings and public spaces to best advantage. That is something I am doing within the arts and culture sector as well. Fáilte Ireland is considering how best it can support outdoor dining experiences in consultation with local authorities. This includes proposed outdoor dining and urban animation schemes. The subject has got a lot of attention. No final decisions have been made regarding the outdoor dining scheme. With further regard to the infrastructure, licensing and planning challenges that exist with the use of outdoor spaces, Fáilte Ireland is exploring options for combining funding for individual businesses with support for local authority-led initiatives. Details have yet to be finalised. I assure Senator Dooley that I am fighting my corner for the tourism and hospitality sector. On businesses seeking the extension of closing dates of certain schemes, I ask the Senator to provide me with the details. I was interested to hear Senator Casey's reports from times past and the 200 years of his hotel. As I said recently to the industry, tourism has seen many challenges but nothing on the scale of this pandemic. It is unprecedented and is the most difficult period ever. We are committed to supporting the sector through reopening and beyond. We will do all we can to get international tourists back again when it is safe to do so.  Senator Mullen referred to State aid. Tourism and hospitality businesses are the main beneficiaries of CRSS, with roughly 60% of the total going to that sector. There are many other supports, as I set out earlier, and Government will continue to review those supports to allow businesses to trade when it is safe to do so. Senators Casey and Mullen mentioned international travel, and I have covered that. Senator Dolan spoke of cycleways and greenways. Obviously, as I am from the Green Party it makes absolute sense to me. As I responded earlier to Senators McGahon and Garvey, this is the kind of low-impact sustainable tourism that makes sense and which we need to develop for the future, for international and domestic tourism. On the query about tourism officers' funding and other queries, I will come back to the Senator on that. I agree with Senator Conway on the need to extend the season and to disperse business across the country, and to extend that regional and seasonal tourism. This will be a key part of sustainable tourism. With regard to the successor to The Gathering, the Senators will be aware the programme for Government incudes a commitment to the Year of the Invitation initiative, which could play a really important role in rebooting tourism. It needs to be done at the right time. My officials are looking at how best to do that. Senator O'Loughlin spelled out very clearly so many of the appeals of Kildare. As the Senator said, I am very familiar with north Kildare as I have family there, and I am somewhat familiar with south Kildare. The Senator has whetted my appetite to get there as soon as possible and I look forward to that. On Senator Blaney's comments, as a proud Ulster woman I have had the pleasure of visiting Donegal. What a beautiful county it is. I will happily take the Senator up on his offer and take my family with me. My children have not yet visited Donegal and I look forward to bringing them there. I am a frequent visitor to Sligo, where I have family, so it is just a hop over to Donegal. Reference was made to Shannon Heritage. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is well aware of the challenges faced by Shannon Heritage, which is part of the Shannon Group. I understand that his Department has been able to provide some supports to them. In addition they are eligible for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS. As with other attractions I am aware that Shannon Heritage wants to open as soon as possible and I want that for it too. I absolutely agree with Senator Blaney on the need to invest in areas of great beauty such as Donegal. It has massive tourism potential and it just needs that investment, such as the investment in Sliabh Liag, Malin Head and the Wild Atlantic Way. We will look at the potential of future projects. With both of us having served on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I know only too well of the many amenities that Senator Ward has talked about. In marketing Dublin pre-pandemic, Tourism Ireland drew attention to its proximity to nature in the many villages and communities the Senator has outlined, in north and south Dublin. It will be even more appealing in the future. Senator Crowe suggested a great idea for online training for chefs. The skills shortage, as I outlined in my speech earlier, is a massive issue. I know this from my engagement with the sector. This is why funding of €5 million was provided in the budget in 2021 for upskilling and training, and to improve the digital presence. With regard to Senator Burke's comments on the connectivity right across my sector, it is often said that there are so many sectors under my remit. To me it makes perfect sense and culture, arts and tourism are a really good fit. On Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, I have a mini comhaltas ceoltóirí in my house every Thursday when my children do harp, mandolin and button accordion by Zoom. It works. I am very aware of the rich heritage of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and tapping into that. Indeed, when I speak of the connectivity right across my sectors, I will be making that connectivity part of my upcoming Department strategy.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Is cúis áthais dom í a bheith anseo sa Seanad an tráthnóna dorcha Nollaig seo chun labhairt faoi na healaíona agus faoin chultúr, go háirithe an earnáil cheol beo agus an earnáil siamsaíochta. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Baill as an deis seo labhairt leo maidir leis na tacaíochtaí atá curtha i bhfeidhm agam don earnáil fíorthábhachtach seo. I am fully aware of the severe difficulties being faced by live performers and all artists as a result of the pandemic and my Department and I have engaged extensively with stakeholders to understand these challenges and put in place supports for the sector. From 7 December, new necessary measures to protect public health were introduced and included restrictions on capacities for live indoor performance. In response to this, the Government agreed to a €25 million increase in funding, bringing the provision for the live performance sector to €50 million in 2022. In addition, I have provided €4 million for the night-time economy in 2022. Restrictions impact very particularly on the viability of live performances and therefore, the Government has increased and expanded horizontal supports from across the Departments including the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and extended the local authority rates waiver to the end of March next year. The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has been amended and reopened to support people who lose their employment from 7 December as a result of the new restrictions. These areas are the responsibility of the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Humphreys, Darragh O'Brien and the Tánaiste, whom I have also engaged with extensively on behalf of the hard-hit sectors I represent. This evening, I intend to give the House details of the supports provided by my Department. The epidemiological situation is such that we are not where we expected to be at this point. We as a Government have had to take the very difficult decision to introduce restrictions by limiting capacity on the live performance sector to 50% of seated capacity, as well as the closure of nightclubs. In 2020 and 2021, the live performance support scheme, LPSS, and the local live performance support scheme, LLPSS, operated by local authorities on behalf of the Department, were instrumental in making it possible for thousands of artists, crew and workers in the arts, culture, live music and entertainment sector to engage in thousands of days of paid work, when it would have not otherwise been economically viable. This support has been far-reaching across the country and across the sector. I will share some results with the House now. The pilot live performance support scheme in 2020 provided support to 59 separate promoters and producers, totalling more than €5 million. The live performance support scheme in 2021 supported 239 promoters, venues and producers in every corner of Ireland. My officials are currently gathering information on activity generated to provide a final report. However, based on information provided today, we can say that more than 32,000 people have been employed through this scheme, with more than 53,000 employment days created. Under the local live performance support scheme, grants were awarded to all 31 local authorities. Senators will probably be aware of this scheme but may not know that it is an initiative of my Department. It has proved incredibly popular and my Department has received very positive feedback on phase 1 of the scheme and the launch of phase 2 was very much welcomed. Its popularity stems in part from the fact that it reaches local musicians, artists and performers that may not have benefited from the LPSS itself. Based on the feedback gathered so far, more than 4,000 people have been employed during phase 1, with more than 6,000 days of employment created. Under the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, a total of 88 grants of up to €25,000 each have been awarded to venues, performance facilities and private sector classes throughout the country for Covid adaptation improvements, including ventilation. These grants have been paid out this week and will undoubtedly be welcomed by a sector which strives to make venues and performance spaces the safest possible for audiences. Under phases 1 and 2 of the event sector Covid support scheme, 480 grants of up to €50,000 each were awarded in 2021. This is targeted support for SMEs operating in the events sector, including event managers, service providers in lighting, sound, stage equipment, fencing equipment, security and catering. Funding for this scheme amounts to €11.5 million and was provided via transfer from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Under the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, which comprised of MEBAS I, MEBAS II and MEBAS phase 2, more than 1,000 grants were approved during 2021, with amounts ranging from €1,500 to €5,000. This scheme supports sole traders, partnerships or incorporated businesses in the sector to include musicians, bands, DJs, sound, lighting, audio engineers, stage managers, and stage technicians. The sum of €1 million was allocated to the St. Patrick's Festival 2021 for arts programming, supporting more than 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. My Department opened up stream D of the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 in July 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is open to not-for-profit arts and culture organisations. Stream D is specifically for any capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in reopening safely after Covid-19 and to help prevent its spread. To date, €977,000 has been allocated to 104 arts and culture organisations with €818,000 of this paid to 100 organisations. The outdoor public space scheme was introduced to help local authorities open up and create public spaces and facilities dedicated to the arts, culture and festivals. The scheme was developed in consultation with the County and City Management Association and with input from Fáilte Ireland. Projects must demonstrate how they will support the night-time economy. Each local authority can apply for up to €250,000 under the scheme. To date, 18 local authorities have been awarded funding of more than €4.4 million under this scheme. I also provided a very important support for well-being in the sector. There is no doubt but that the mental health of the nation is taking a battering under Covid-19. If anything, this is much more acute for artists who have a compelling need to perform their art. I provided €230,000 to Minding Creative Minds, a free counselling service available to every individual in the creative sectors. The package of supports for €50 million that I announced last week included a reactive support for events that were due to take place in December and January to minimise cancellations and to provide support where these are unavoidable. The new supports for the sector include €5 million for the seasonal musical theatre and pantomime scheme. This fund will increase from €2 million to €5 million and the turnover requirement is being reduced to €100,000 from €300,000 with applications being accepted until the end of January 2022. This scheme is now open for applications. Funding has already begun to be paid out to the successful applicants this week. A total of €20 million has been provided for another strand of the live performance support scheme, LPSS 3, specifically to support performances in December and January which may need to be cancelled, curtailed or rescheduled. This non-competitive scheme will open for applications tomorrow, 17 December. Venues, including nightclubs that stage live performances, producers and promoters can apply for up to 50% of their eligible costs. A minimum of €14 million is being provided for another strand of the live performance support scheme, LPSS 4, to support performances being staged from February 2022 to June 2022. This scheme will open in January 2022, and gives venues and promoters some certainty that they can continue to run financially viable live performances with our support across the sector for the first half of the year. With this money, they can continue to employ musicians and the people who help behind the scenes. Further assessments will take place as we continue through to the new year. The sum of €5 million is being provided for local authorities to support local artists and performances through the local live performance support scheme. This will include funding for community and local pantomimes. A total of €5 million is being provided to continue the capital supports scheme, the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, CECGS, to venues, including for ventilation upgrades and other Covid adaptations. Stream D of the cultural capital scheme for not-for-profits will continue as long as the pandemic restrictions are extant. The sum of €1 million will again be provided to the Saint Patrick's Festival 2022 to employ artists and arts workers. A further extension of MEBAS, which supports businesses in the music sector, will be announced in January. The current phase 2 of this scheme has provided grant support to businesses to cover costs up to the end of December. The Minding Creative Minds well-being initiative will continue to be funded. The rationale behind these schemes is to provide employment opportunities for artists, musicians and crew. Thousands of days of employment were generated by the schemes over the summer and autumn when other activity was restricted due to public health measures. I am confident that the new strands of the schemes will give much needed employment to musicians, artists and arts workers again, including in the nightclub sector. I am committed to supporting the live performance and the nightclub sector as it journeys through this really difficult phase. The schemes aim to be as flexible, responsive and timely as possible in that regard. In 2021, I allocated a record €130 million to the Arts Council. The council has been doing extraordinary work in getting this funding to artists and arts organisations across the State.It would take many hours to elaborate and itemise the interventions made by the Arts Council with this money but here is a flavour. The council provided funding for 12 organisations that protected them from closure, with €1.7 million from the emergency stability fund, with over €8 million awarded through the agility award to over 1,800 individual artists, and with €4.3 million in capacity building support scheme funding for 248 organisations. It enabled artists to better reach the public with a series of digital skills webinars and a toolkit. Maureen Gaffney chaired Surviving or Thriving well-being webinars, which was and is a particularly important intervention. The Arts Council also oversaw a 239% increase in approved bursaries and an increase of 412% in the value of the bursaries in 2021. Some 189 new schools joined the Creative Schools programme in 2021, alongside 164 schools which are continuing their second year of the programme. Over 265 creative artists, practitioners and associates are engaged in the initiative. As a former music teacher, a singer and as someone who has busked many a time in Dublin's Grafton Street, like so many musicians and music lovers in this House, I have been distraught at the damage done to our arts during the pandemic. This is just a snapshot of the work my Department and the Arts Council have done to support the sector throughout this Covid-19 crisis. I guarantee that it is support that will continue unabated so long as the sector needs it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A separate scheme was rolled out.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank everyone for their contributions. I understand and appreciate the passion with which each Senator spoke and acknowledge how difficult these restrictions have been and continue to be, how cruel they are and the havoc Covid-19 has wrought on the live performance sector. I want to make it clear that I have nothing but respect for the musicians of this country. I respect the passion each Senator has and their contributions, but I have nothing but passion and respect for musicians. Unfortunately, Ireland remains vulnerable to a further deterioration in the disease profile, depending on a number of factors, including the levels of social contact in the coming weeks and over the festive period. That is why, unfortunately, we had to introduce these additional measures to protect public health. Many Senators raised issues relating to the PUP and they have also been raised by the stakeholders I have engaged with. My Department officials have in turn flagged them with the Department of Social Protection. In the Dáil earlier, the Tánaiste said he would engage directly with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, today, which I welcome, to see if there could be flexibility. We do not want to see people facing this at Christmastime. I welcome that recognition from the Tánaiste and, if Senator Black was not already aware of it, I am sure she will too. Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about planning for what will happen after 9 January. That was on my mind when that restriction was put in place until 9 January and that is why I have said the money for the cancelling and curtailing of events goes through to the end of January. I signal now that there will be a minimum of €14 million so people can plan right through to June. There is a Covid contingency fund which, with the help of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, I have tapped into to get this extra money. I will not be found wanting and will look for more money if the industry needs it. It is so the industry can plan, if there are restrictions. Please God there will not be. I keep hoping the industry will open, our theatres will be full and we will all enjoy music in every corner of Ireland. However, if we cannot, I am saying they should plan because we will help them. My Department will make it viable for them to plan until June so I urge them to plan and employ musicians. We are stepping in. That is critical to the next phase after 9 January. I and my Department will continue to engage meaningfully with stakeholders. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I met with the live performance stakeholders last week. Senator Murphy referred to people being left behind but we are strict that every one gets the same time. No one gets to speak for ten minutes while others speak for two. It is timed so each is treated with equality. We met them all and stakeholder engagement has been at the heart of everything I have done as a Minister. As recently as Monday, my officials and advisers met with representatives of the music and live entertainment sector again. Yesterday, we hosted a historic engagement with over 150 artists, arts workers and representative bodies because it is important that they shape the basic income for the arts pilot. Senator Warfield asked if are we doing the right thing here. I am following what artists asked for. This was the number one recommendation from them. I thought it was important that they shape it. Nothing is set in stone yet because I want the artists to shape this basic income. This is their demand to me through the arts and culture recovery task force and I am responding because it is about time we started valuing the arts by giving them this basic income. Many speakers referenced the MEAI. My Department has had consistent engagement with that group. I have engaged with it on eight separate occasions since the pandemic began and there have been 21 departmental engagements on top of that.That is not to mention the numerous phone calls and messages that take place out of hours and over the weekends. To say that I am not listening or not engaging is simply incorrect. I am fiercely supportive of musicians, local artists and arts workers. Their sector is large and there are many representative groups with which I frequently engage to hear their feedback first hand. That includes the MEAI, the Live Venue Collective, the Events Industry Alliance, the Large Venue Association, the National Campaign for the Arts, the Independent Producers Forum, EPIC, and the Wedding Bands Association which Senator Currie mentioned. We have engaged with them and they received money from the live performance support scheme, LPSS. They were quick to say thank you. We have engaged with the Wedding Bands Association and continue to do so.  The music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, was developed in close consultation with the MEAI because it said it needed it to reach its members. It was launched in June 2021. Initially €14 million was reserved to deliver the scheme. That was over-estimated by those involved. I am grateful for the advocacy groups such as MEAI which endeavour to represent workers in its sector. More than 1,000 recipients have received €3 million in business supports through each of the three variations of the MEBAS initiative. Since its launch 628 freelancers, sole traders, musicians, businesses, bands and crew were awarded the business expense support grants ranging from €2,500 to €5,000. The scheme, in consultation after meeting with the MEAI, was adjusted again in August at its request to allow for businesses with a turnover of €15,000 to €20,000 to come within the threshold. That allowed an additional 74 businesses and sole traders to meet the limits. No demonstration of costs was required. They just had to say that they had costs to get the MEBAS grant. That was following consultation with the MEAI. I recognise that even this lower level intervention is important for musicians survival to meet their business costs. Some 386 grants have been awarded in the latest phase. That covers business costs up to the end of December. Payments are continuing. I am delighted to confirm that another round will be delivered in January 2022.  The LPSS announced last week is a non-competitive scheme. The previous LPSS supported more than 50,000 musicians. It is not the case that the supports I announced last week are all for ticketed events. They cover non-ticketed events too. We are clear that the Government introducing these restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the most economically important time of the year for live performance and pantomime, is disappointing. It is beyond a bitter disappointment that we have arrived again at this point. This industry has been asked countless times to shoulder the burden of protecting society and those around them to the detriment of their livelihoods and mental health. At all times I am trying to support them in every possible way through engaging with them. I am profoundly grateful to their sacrifice. We are thankful for the joy that they bring to our lives and their incredible work. I want them back singing again. With every scheme we devise, we in the Department ask ourselves, "How can we help them and how can we help them get the money?" I am constantly thinking about the musicians, their livelihoods and putting food on the table.  We had hoped not to take the backwards step in the lengthy process of reopening all parts of society and the economy but the path of the pandemic has not proved to be predictably linear and that is why the €50 million was announced last week. As I said, a Covid contingency fund of €4 billion is there. That is where I got the extra €25 million from last week. If necessary, we will return to that fund if our musicians and artists need it. The fund is to provide certainty and flexibility for the public finances should the situation around the virus deteriorate further. If further funding is required, I will seek additional support from the fund and the sector can be certain that we will not be found wanting. I hope I have reassured Senators of the vast depth of support, respect and commitment that I have for the arts, culture, music and entertainment sector. That goes to the core of everything I do.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Dlí ceannródaíoch is ea é an Bille um Rialáil Sabháilteachta ar Líne agus na Meán, 2022 agus tá áthas orm é a chur faoi bhráid an Tí. The main aim of this legislation is to jump-start modernisation of Ireland's approach to the regulation of content, both for traditional editorial media and the landscape of newer online services fuelled by user-generated content.This is driven by changes in the way we consume media and the growth of the online world. Streaming services are now a key feature of everyday life. They are on our phones, laptops and televisions. However, regulation of these editorially controlled services has not kept pace with the regulation of broadcasting services. This Bill will change that and ensure that streaming services are subject to up-to-date rules. While the fact the Internet is a key part of our lives has become increasingly apparent, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought sharp focus to this reality. From working from home to schooling from home, the Internet has enabled us to weather this pandemic in ways that have surprised us all. While the Internet has had a broadly positive impact, there are risks, however, especially to children. Some of these risks are online extensions of existing problems, such as bullying. Others represent new challenges in our digital age, such as image-based abuse. While we have updated our criminal law for the online age, there has not yet been a way to hold online services to account. These are key matters this Bill will begin to tackle for the first time. As such, the Bill's scope is ambitious and includes updates to the regulation of broadcasting services, including radio, television and streaming services. It also provides for the creation of a new regulatory framework for online safety to tackle the availability of the most serious forms of harmful online content. This will be done by providing for risk-based regulation of services that facilitate access to user-generated content. In doing this, the Bill also provides for the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive into Irish law. The foundations for achieving this ambition are those elements of the Bill that provide for the creation of a new regulatory body, coimisiún na meán, the media commission, which will implement and enforce these new and updated rules. In order to do so, an coimisiún will have a robust and modern suite of regulatory functions and powers and, in line with EU law and best practice, will be wholly independent in its exercise of those functions and powers. Regulatory independence is key to effective regulation, especially for content regulation, where fundamental rights are so important. In some parts of Europe, this independence is being eroded. It is vital that Ireland leads on this issue. The powers of an coimisiún include the power to fund its operations by levying the services it regulates; to create legally binding regulatory codes; to gather information and appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations; and to seek the imposition of sanctions for failures of compliance, including financial sanctions of up to €20 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is higher. In the most serious cases, an coimisiún may seek criminal prosecution of senior executives of non-compliant services and seek court orders to block access to a service in Ireland. In respect of broadcasters, an coimisiún will retain the power to revoke broadcasting contracts for serious breaches. An coimisiún will also take over the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. The staff of the BAI, approximately 40 people, will transfer to an coimisiún. I envisage that an coimisiún will need to scale quickly up to a staffing level of at least 160 and in the longer term may require staffing of up to 300. The Government has approved the establishment of an coimisiún on an administrative basis, including recruitment of key personnel, prior to the enactment of this Bill. Work on this is ongoing between my officials, the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. While the functions of an coimisiún primarily relate to the regulation of services, it will also have wider roles relating to the protection of children, research, education, media literacy, and journalistic and creative supports. In carrying out these roles, an coimisiún will support and promote an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment. There is a widespread problem with the availability of harmful and criminal content on widely used online services. It is clear that self-regulation in online safety is not working and that oversight and accountability is required. As regards online safety, the Bill requires an coimisiún to regulate video-sharing platform services in line with the directive. In addition, the Bill provides an coimisiún with the power to designate further online services for regulation from a pool of relevant online services.In this context, an online service is relevant if it facilitates access to user-generated content. This covers a very wide range of services, including social media services, many gaming services and online messaging and storage services. In order to designate an online service, an coimisiún is required to conduct a risk assessment of the service, including regarding the prevalence of harmful online content available through the service and the nature and scale of the service. This approach will enable an coimisiún to direct its energies to the areas where they are most needed. Once an online service is designated, an coimisiún can require it to comply with binding online safety codes. These codes can require online services to adapt their systems and processes in three key areas which are rules for content moderation and complaints handling; rules regarding the design of the service and how and why it displays certain content to users; and rules about advertising. With regard to video-sharing platform services, an coimisiún is required to apply the provisions of the directive to those services through these codes. The main aim of the online safety codes is to tackle and progressively reduce the availability of harmful online content on designated online services. In this regard, the Bill clearly defines harmful online content. Online content is harmful where it either relates to one of 40 criminal offences listed in the Bill, or is cyberbullying, the promotion or encouragement of eating disorders, self-harm or suicide, or makes available knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide. The schedule of criminal offences includes the offences under Coco's Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, with regard to image-based abuse, abusive communications and harassment. For harmful online content which is not criminal in nature, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful. This includes whether the online content gives rise to any risk to a person's life or a reasonably-foreseeable risk to a person's mental or physical health. The Bill also provides for a mechanism for future categories of harmful online content, both criminal and non-criminal, to be added to this list, subject to Oireachtas oversight. The Bill also requires an coimisiún to create a super-complaints scheme, under which nominated bodies such as expert NGOs can formally notify an coimisiún of a range of online safety issues. In addition, the Bill empowers an coimisiún to audit the handling of complaints by designated online services. In summary, the online safety elements of this Bill will ensure that an individual person will be exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made. In this regard, an coimisiún will have significant powers of compliance and sanction to hold these services to account. As the Members will be aware, I have established an expert group to examine providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. The role of the expert group is to examine whether it is practicable to do this and, if so, how it may be done. The group has 90 days from the date of its first meeting, which was on 31 January 2022, to examine this matter and to report back to me with its recommendations. Following this, I will then consider tabling an amendment as the Bill passes through the Oireachtas. If an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for, I would like to ensure that it is. In this regard, any proposals that I bring forward must be workable and legally robust. In terms of the regulation of broadcasting and streaming services, this will for the most part be done through media codes and rules. Media codes are mostly about the content of programming, including rules for programme standards and advertising. Media rules, on the other hand, are mostly about the presentation and structure of the service, including rules regarding the time given to advertising, accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities and quotas for European works. In order to ensure the uninterrupted regulation of broadcasters, provision is made for the existing broadcasting codes and rules to be carried over and become media codes and rules. The Bill also provides for the mandatory registration of streaming services to ensure that, in line with the directive, all streaming services established in Ireland are subject to appropriate regulation. Broadcasters will remain regulated on a contractual basis. The Bill also provides for the transposition of an optional provision in the directive to empower an coimisiún to levy broadcasters and streaming services, including those established elsewhere in the EU, in respect of any revenues that they may make in Ireland in order to fund the production of European works, including Irish-produced works.Provision is made so that the money collected could be dispersed by an coimisiún through a content production scheme. The Bill does not set the amounts of any such levy as this would be inflexible but enables an coimisiún to design and implement a levy having regard to relevant economic factors. There are potential risks and benefits to a levy, including for consumers, and it is intended that an coimisiún would thoroughly examine these matters before these provisions are commenced. Turning to a more detailed overview of the provisions of the Bill, it is first important to note that it amends the Broadcasting Act 2009. Part 1 addresses preliminary and general matters. Part 2 amends the 2009 Act to insert and amend a number of definitions, including key definitions such as the definition of a "relevant online service". Furthermore, sections 4 and 5 under this part provide for the relevant jurisdiction rules from the directive. Part 3 amends Part 2 of the 2009 Act to provide for the establishment of coimisiún na meán. Key provisions under this part include provision for the independence of an coimisiún, the appointment of commissioners, including a chairperson, an coimisiún to impose levies on regulated services - not including community broadcasters - to fund its operations, an coimisiún to report on its operations and the accountability of the chairperson to the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairperson and other commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees. Part 3 also provides for the general powers and functions of an coimisiún. It is important to note that this provision does not contain every power and function to be exercised by an coimisiún but does set out, at a high-level, certain powers and functions that an coimisiún shall exercise and matters that it shall take into account when exercising its powers. This includes upholding Ireland's democratic values, protecting the interests of the public, in particular children, ensuring the diverse needs of the people of this island are served by our media, stimulating content production, particularly in respect of the Irish language and climate matters and sustaining independent and impartial journalism. In particular, an coimisiún is provided with a strong education and research role. Part 4 provides for matters related to the registration of providers of streaming services through the insertion of a new Part 3A into the 2009 Act. Part 5 concerns the duties, codes and rules applicable to radio and television broadcasters and streaming services and provides for these through the insertion of a new part 3B into the 2009 Act. Chapter 2 of this new Part concerns duties, including in relation to privacy, news and current affairs and advertising. Chapters 3 and 5 of this new part concern media codes and rules. Chapter 3 of this Part also provides that existing broadcasting codes and rules made by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, such as access rules, will continue in force following the enactment of the Bill. Part 6 amends Part 4 of the 2009 Act and primarily concerns changes to take into account the establishment of an coimisiún and the statutory regulation of streaming services in respect of redress mechanisms. Part 9 amends Part 7 of the 2009 Act to take into account the establishment of an coimisiún in regard to public service broadcasting, allow for the part-funding of the broadcasting functions of an coimisiún from television licence receipts, provide for changes to the calculation of total advertising time for broadcasters and insert a new chapter 7 regarding the availability and prominence of public service programmes and services. Part 11 inserts a new Part 8A into the 2009 Act concerning online safety regulation. Chapter 1 of this new part concerns the definitions of harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content, which I have already detailed. Chapter 2 concerns the process for designating relevant online services for regulation. Chapter 3 concerns the making of online safety codes, the matters which they can address and matters which need to be taken into account when the codes are being drawn up, including the protection of children, fundamental rights, the nature and scale of online services and the impact of automated decision-making or algorithms. Chapter 4 concerns the making of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices. Chapter 5 concerns an obligation on an coimisiún to establish a super-complaints scheme for nominated bodies, and a number of other matters. Part 11 also inserts a new Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act containing the list of offence specific categories of harmful online content. Part 12 inserts a new Part 8B into the 2009 Act concerning investigations and sanctions. Chapter 2 and of this new Part provides an coimisiún with the power to appoint authorised officers and concerns the procedure for investigations by those officers and decisions by an coimisiún following investigations. Chapter 4 concerns the imposition of administrative financial sanctions. Chapter 5 of this new Part provides an coimisiún with the power to issue notices to end a contravention and provides for secondary criminal liability for senior executives linked to these. Chapter 6 provides an coimisiún with the power to seek court orders to block access to non-compliant online services in Ireland. Chapter 7 provides an coimisiún with the power to issue content limitation notices in respect of individual items of harmful online content. Chapter 8 provides for three categories of summary offences under the Bill and provides an coimisiún with the power to prosecute these offences. This part also inserts a new Schedule 4 into the 2009 Act concerning oral hearings. Parts 7, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 17 amend various Parts of the 2009 Act and other relevant Acts to take into account the dissolution of the BAI and the establishment of an coimisiún. Part 14 inserts a new Part 10A in the 2009 Act concerning European works. This Part provides for the requirements of the directive for European works quotas and prominence and provides an coimisiún with the power to introduce a European works levy and European works scheme. Lastly, Part 16 provides for transitional matters. As can be seen, given its subject matter, this Bill is necessarily complex and far-reaching. It deals with a wide range of important issues from modernising media regulation to introducing, for the first time, online safety regulation to tackle the availability of serious forms of harmful online content. I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work undertaken by the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media on the general scheme of the Bill as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process. The report of the committee demonstrated the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny to the democratic process. I was pleased to address a significant number of the recommendations made by the joint committee through the Bill. As we now progress through the next phase of parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill, I look forward to the Senators' contributions.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their valuable contributions. The constructive approach demonstrated during the debate reflects our shared determination to put in place an effective regulatory framework for online safety and audiovisual on-demand services. It builds on the intensive scrutiny the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media gave to the general scheme of the Bill last year. The diverse range of issues raised on the floor in the past few hours highlights both the scale of the Bill and the fact it will break new ground regulating sectors that have so far not been subject to oversight. As such, it represents an important step into a new frontier of lawmaking. I agree with Senator McGahon that this Bill is not the final word when it comes to legislation in respect of the online world but rather the first of many in the coming years as more legislation comes from Europe. I reiterate the core contents and objectives of the Bill. It will ensure we are all exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to, and robustly deal with, complaints when they are made. While the Bill will not and cannot address every issue of concern arising from the online world, it will create a robust and adaptable framework for accountability that can be amended and expanded over time to match the pace at which, as Senator McGahon mentioned, the tech world moves. This framework will be enforced by Coimisiún na Meán, which will include an online safety commissioner and have one of the most modern and robust suites of regulatory powers in Irish law. In providing a basis and starting point for the regulation of harmful online content, the establishment of Coimisiún na Meán is the most vital part of the Bill. In regard to broadcasters and streaming services, the Bill is fundamentally about the modernisation of the regulatory environment, enabling the commission to deal with the continuing changes in how we engage with and support our media in Ireland. The Bill has a critical EU law dimension, given it will transpose the revised audiovisual media service directive, which has strongly informed the underpinnings of the coimisiún. As Senators will be aware, given the complexity of this legislation, we missed the transposition deadline for the directive, which is one reason I am especially keen to see the legislation progress through the Houses to enactment as soon as possible. Having said that, I am committed to comprehensive debate in this House on Committee and Report Stages, which will provide opportunities for us to discuss each section of the Bill and any amendments in further detail. In the time that remains, I will endeavour to address the issues raised by various Senators. I thank Senators Martin, Cassells, McGahon, Warfield, Sherlock and Higgins for raising the individual complaints mechanism, a matter I have been considering closely for some time. The issue of providing for avenues of redress against individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the Bill as published is to provide Coimisiún na Meán with the power, through the making of binding online safety codes, to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanism in place, with powers of audit and investigation in that respect. In addition, the Bill provides that the coimisiún shall establish a super-complaints scheme under which bodies such as NGOs or other expert groups may be nominated to notify the commission of matters relating to online safety, including in respect of the availability of harmful online content. There are practical issues with providing the online safety commissioner with an almost ombudsman-like role in this regard, including the volume of content online, the fact it will regulate some services on an EU-wide basis, issues of due process and questions of how quickly decisions could reasonably be made. However, in light of the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Bill, I am examining how these issues can be addressed. As I set out at the start of the debate, this is why I established an expert group to report to me within 90 days on these matters, with recommendations I may use as the basis for an amendment to introduce an individual complaints mechanism. The terms of reference of the expert group are very much focused on the practicalities of whether the individual complaints mechanism can work. Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the Australian e-safety commissioner, and this group will engage with that commissioner. I had hoped the Australian e-safety commissioner could be a member of the group but she was not available. Instead, she has committed to engaging with the expert group, which is important. As I have said on many occasions, if an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for in the Bill, I will ensure that is done. I met the expert advisory group and made clear at our first meeting that that was my intention. Given the timeline set out in the terms of reference for the group, I expect to receive the report at the end of April and then consider whether and what amendments will be required in the context of Committee Stage in the Dáil. Taking account of the work of the expert groups under way, I do not want to pre-empt or prejudge any recommendations it may make, although I reiterate I am committed to a full and open discussion of any Government amendments made in the Dáil when the Bill, as amended, is returned to this House. Senator Keogan raised the issue of the commission being funded from the licence fee. The Bill will enable this but not require it. It is carried over from the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 and will allow the broadcasting levy to be reduced for broadcasters, including independent radio. To clarify, TG4 is not funded from the licence fee. Senators Keogan and Pauline O'Reilly spoke about how a rights-based approach has been taken in the Bill, which will underpin the work of Coimisiún na Meán. This means there will be a careful balance between the need to safeguard freedom of expression while taking into account that children and other members of the public need to be safeguarded. Their rights matter too. Senators Martin, McGahon, Warfield, Kyne, O'Loughlin and Murphy raised the issue of disinformation. This is, of course, a significant and complex issue that requires a distinct and targeted response. The EU is reviewing the code of practice on disinformation in order to strengthen it and to link it to the forthcoming Digital Services Act, which will set out the standards for platforms in dealing with these issues. The code of practice, a European Commission imitative, has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation.The commission intends that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. In addition, the European Commission has established the European Digital Media Observatory, including a hub in Dublin City University, which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. Senator Sherlock asked about specifying the role of the online safety commissioner. This is primarily a drafting issue. During the drafting process, legal advice was given that explicitly carving out specific roles within the multi-commissioner model could create difficulties if, for example, a commissioner was ill or if we wanted to appoint more than one online safety commissioner to an coimisiún. I am looking at how these issues can be overcome and will table an amendment to the Bill to address this matter. In any case, it is my intention, and that of the Government, to advertise for, and recruit, an online safety commissioner this year through an open, transparent and effective process managed by the Public Appointments Service. Work is under way in this regard.  Senator Kyne questioned why this would be a commission and not a board. This is the model for many regulators. For example, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has an executive chair and a number of commissioners, while ComReg and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities also have a multi-person commission model. Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of youth advisory groups. The Bill, I am glad, provides for advisory committees to coimisiún na meán to be established. Senator O'Loughlin asked about the educational role of the media commission. The online safety commissioner will have a role in carrying out educational initiatives such as public information campaigns and I will work with existing educational bodies such as the Department of Education, webwise.ie and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on this. The commissioner will also be able to endorse third-party providers of online safety educational materials, which will help schools source appropriate and robust online safety materials for students. Senators Cassells and Warfield raised the Future of Media Commission report. The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, provided for the establishment of the commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media. This was in recognition of the challenges facing the media sector, such as falling advertising revenue arising from the shift in consumption patterns due to evolving technology. The commission was tasked with making recommendations to the Taoiseach and myself to ensure that the future funding of public service broadcasting could be sustainable, give security of funding, ensure independent editorial oversight and deliver value for money to the public. The commission completed its work last autumn and submitted its report to the Taoiseach and me. As Senators can imagine, the report's recommendations are far-reaching and will inform media and broadcasting policy in the coming years. The commission's recommendations require careful and detailed consideration, particularly in light of a range of other complex and interrelated issues that will require decisions by the Government in the wider media and digital space. It is intended that the report be brought to Government for consideration shortly. Senators Cassells, McGahon and Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of staffing. Some €5.5 million was secured as part of budget 2022 to establish the media commission on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. This funding will help in the recruitment of key personnel. I previously stated that staffing of approximately 120 will be required during the start-up phase of the media commission. In the longer term, I estimate that the commission will require in excess of the 300 I mentioned at the beginning of the debate to fully operationalise its envisaged functions. I anticipate the need for additional staff, should the commission be assigned further functions in the future, including in respect of upcoming EU legislation. Of course these staff would need to have specific expertise. That goes without saying. With regard to the data tracking issue raised by Senator Sherlock, that is a different matter from content regulation and lies with the Data Protection Commissioner. However, the Bill provides for co-operation between the online safety commissioner, coimisiún na meán and other regulators.  Senators Cassells, Warfield, Sherlock, Higgins, Currie and Pauline O'Reilly raised bans on the advertising of gambling, alcohol, foods high in fat, salt or sugar, or HFSS foods, and infant formula, particularly with regard to advertising to children. It is not a question of bravery. These are significant and cross-cutting matters that bring together a range of different policy areas under different Ministers. For example, the regulation of gambling advertising is set out in the recently published general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill, which comes under the Department of Justice. Infant formula, food and alcohol advertising are policy areas under the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health and are already subject to extensive regulation through, for example, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018. While my officials are engaging with officials from other relevant Departments on these matters, it is clear that the functions and expertise for these policy areas lies more appropriately with those Departments. The online safety commissioner will have a role in regulating commercial advertising on certain online services through its online safety codes. Just as the BAI does currently, the commissioner will engage with health experts and others in developing these codes and will reflect public policy in this regard. This will also be the case in respect of media codes and rules that will apply to broadcasters and video on-demand services. Senator Higgins raised section 30 of the Data Protection Act, which banned processing of children's data but was never commenced. This confirms that the issue has a strong data protection dimension. The regulators will collaborate. The Senator also raised the potential overreach. The powers have been scrutinised by our legal advisers but I am open to listening to concerns in that regard. The Bill provides for measures to ensure the prominence and findability of public service content. I agree with Senator Warfield that this is an important matter as the volume of content and services expands. On the matter of data and access for researchers, this will be provided for in the Digital Services Act. Senator Conway raised age verification for children online. There is a real issue with young children accessing online services that simply were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue of which I am particularly aware, both as a parent of young children and as chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety. We need to find workable solutions to the negative uses of online spaces. Anonymity raises a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented. In this regard, an EU-funded pilot programme called euCONSENT is in development. That pilot aims to deliver a system for online age verification and parental consent that balances the rights of children with the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content. The outcome of this pilot will inform any approach taken to this issue at EU and national level. I will ask an coimisiún to look at this issue as a priority and to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. As I said previously, not everything can be dealt with in a single Bill but what matters now is that we have the framework in place. Senators Cassells, Warfield, Malcolm Byrne and Kyne raised the issue of the content production levy. The revised AVMSD provides member states with the option of introducing a levy on television broadcasting and video on-demand services to fund audiovisual content production. To exercise this option, section 53 of the legislation provides that coimisiún na meán may introduce a content production levy and a content production scheme to fund the production of European works, including Irish works. The proceeds of any such levy would go into a content production scheme, which producers could apply for funding from. It would be similar to the sound and vision fund. It is intended that this levy would be introduced by the comisiún, subject to an assessment of its viability and whether it would have negative effects. As I said earlier, there are risks as well as benefits here for the Irish audiovisual sector. In line with EU law, any levy introduced under the Bill must be imposed equally on all services targeting the Irish market, including Irish services and those based outside Ireland. That means that Irish media service providers such as RTÉ or Virgin Media Television would also be subject to this levy. In addition, both Irish services and those based in other member states of any size will then be eligible to apply for the content production fund established as a result of the levy. Any levy will only apply to income earned within this State. For example, for a provider such as Netflix, which earns 2% of its overall EU revenues in this State, the levy can only apply to that 2%. The aforementioned factors could significantly constrain the overall positive impact on the potential level of additional funding for Irish content. I was asked if I would set out the exact percentages and the process involved with the levy in the legislation. That approach would be inflexible and an coimisiún, as an independent body, should have the power to design and enforce the levy and change it over time. I expect that an examination of the content levy will be among the priorities of an coimisiún upon its establishment. I am almost out of time. I apologise to those who raised issues I did not address.I look forward to a constructive and detailed debate. As I said, I am committed to that debate. The interest Senators have shown, their attendance and their varied contributions show how important this legislation is to many Senators. I look forward to debating it further.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Mar Aire Turasóireachta, Cultúir, Ealaíon, Gaeltachta, Spóirt agus Meán, fáiltím roimh an deis labhairt leis na Seanadóirí inniu i Seanad Éireann le linn Sheachtain na Gaeilge 2022. Nuair a bhímid ag caint ar theangacha, labhraímid ar an máthairtheanga. Is iad ár máithreacha agus ár seanmháithreacha a labhair ár dteanga, an Ghaeilge, linn le cinntiú go mbeadh sí againn inniu le roinnt ar ár leanaí féin agus ar na glúnta atá le teacht. Rinneamar ceiliúradh inné ar Lá Idirnáisiúnta na mBan. Bhí mná an domhain ag ceiliúradh ar lámh amháin agus ag fulaingt ar lámh eile.Táim ag cuimhneamh go háirithe ar mhná na hÚcráine. Ní féidir linn a chur i bhfocail an sléacht atá ag tarlú inniu in oirthear na hEorpa sa bhliain 2022. Mar bhean, goileann sé orm na tuairiscí atá ag teacht amach as an Úcráin. Tá mná ag teitheadh agus iad ag iarraidh a leanaí a chosaint. Tá mná eile ag fanacht agus ag seasamh ar son an daonlathais, ar son na héagsúlachta agus ar son na síochána. Mar dhuine daonna agus mar bhean, is tuar dóchais dom an daonnacht atá á léiriú ag pobail, go háirithe sna tíortha sin ar theorainn oirthear na hÚcráine agus anseo ag an mbaile. Leanaimis lenár n-iarrachtaí gach tacaíocht ar féidir linn a thabhairt do phobal na hÚcráine agus pobail trí chéile atá ag fulaingt de bharr na sléachta seo. Táimid ar fad ag súil go mór le filleadh na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge ó cheann ceann na tíre go dtí an Ghaeltacht an samhradh seo. Tá tábhacht faoi leith ag scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge de chuid mo Roinne don Ghaeilge agus do gheilleagar na Gaeltachta araon agus í 50 bliain ar an bhfód i mbliana. Ag croílár an scéil, tá na mná tí Ghaeltachta a chuireann lóistín ar fáil do na mílte scoláirí bliain i ndiaidh bliana. Is é cuspóir scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, atá ar an scéim is sine atá á riar ag an Roinn, tacú le deiseanna breise sealbhaithe agus saibhrithe teanga a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht do lucht freastail iar-bhunscoileanna agus tríú leibhéal na tíre. Ceaptar go bhfuil tuairim is 1 milliún foghlaimeoir tar éis leas a bhaint as an scéim ó bunaíodh í 50 bliain ó shin in 1972. Tá moladh mór ag dul do mhná na Gaeltachta dá bharr inniu, lá tar éis Lá Idirnáisiúnta na mBan. Tuigim gur labhair Linda Ervine sa Teach seo an tseachtain seo caite maidir leis an obair atá ar bun aici in oirthear Bhéal Feirste. Is léir go bhfeiceann Linda, agus a cuid oibre cheannródaíochta ar bun aici, gur linne uile ar an oileán seo an Ghaeilge. Molaim í dá bharr agus tapaím an deis seo tréaslú léi as an dul chun cinn atá déanta aici. Tá an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge agus an plean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge ann, in éindí lé polasaí an Stáit don Ghaeilge agus do na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá úinéireacht tras-Rialtais ar an straitéis agus ar an bplean gníomhaíochta a thacaíonn léi. Dá réir sin, tá sé de chúram ar Ranna Rialtais, ar fhorais agus ar eagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta an plean a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá sé de chúram ar mo Roinn an obair sin a chomhordú chomh maith, dar ndóigh. Foilsíodh an dara tuairisc ar fheidhmiú an phlean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge roimh an Nollaig in 2021. De thoradh na comhpháirtíochta agus na comhúinéireachta a bhaineann leis seo uile, is údar sásaimh é domsa go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach le sonrú sa dara tuairisc seo. Den 185 gníomh sa phlean, atá á bhforbairt ag thart ar 60 páirtí leasmhar, bhí 51 gníomh le cur i bhfeidhm idir 2018 agus deireadh 2020. Bhí 27 gníomh curtha i bhfeidhm ag deireadh 2020 agus tá 16 eile idir lámha. Bhain moill le hocht gcinn acu. Tá an tAcht teanga nua achtaithe agus deireadh curtha leis an maolú ar úsáid na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach ó shin. Is péire de na bearta polasaí is mó i saol na Gaeilge a cuireadh i bhfeidhm le fada an lá iad. Gan amhras, bhí sé dúshlánach feidhmiú le linn na paindéime le cúpla bliain anuas ach, mar sin féin, tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta in ainneoin na ndúshlán a chuir an phaindéim romhainn. Anuraidh, d'fhoilsigh an eagraíocht Státmhaoinithe Gaeltachta, Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta, taighde nua ar theaghlaigh atá ag tógáil a gclann le Gaeilge laistigh de na limistéir oifigiúla Gaeltachta. Gan dabht, is píosa tábhachtach taighde atá anseo a bheidh ina áis do mo Roinn agus d'eagraíochtaí eile atá ag feidhmiú san earnáil Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Is sampla é den tsárobair atá ar siúl ag Tuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht. Bhí muidne sa Roinn an-sásta go raibh ar ár gcumas allúntas suas le €1.6 milliún thar an tréimhse 2021 go 2023 a cheadú don eagraíocht. Cuirfidh an t-allúntas seo ar chumas na heagraíochta, a bhfuil seisear feidhmeannach fostaithe aige anois, cur leis an raon gníomhaíochtaí agus tacaíochtaí atá á riar aige sna ceantair Ghaeltachta éagsúla mar thaca breise d'fheidhmiú an phróisis pleanála teanga agus an pholasaí don oideachas Gaeltachta araon. Is léir go bhfuil dúshláin againn maidir le staid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, mar a aithnítear sa tuarascáil. Ní féidir le haon duine a shéanadh go bhfuil géarchéim ann sna ceantair Ghaeltachta is laige. Is í an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge bunchloch pholasaí an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge. Mar a cuireadh in iúl roimhe seo, tá raon moltaí á gcur i bhfeidhm i láthair na huaire sa straitéis a bhaineann leis na naoi réimse seo a leanas: oideachas; an Ghaeltacht; an teaghlach; riarachán; seirbhísí agus pobal; na meáin agus an teicneolaíocht; foclóirí; reachtaíocht agus stádas; agus saol eacnamaíochta agus tionscnaimh leathana. Is tríd an obair sna réimsí éagsúla seo a thabharfaimid aghaidh ar na dúshláin sa Ghaeltacht a shárú. Ar ndóigh, tá réimse na fostaíochta ar cheann de na réimsí is tábhachtaí ó thaobh na teanga de, agus go háirithe fostaíocht sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Anuraidh, cruthaíodh 825 post nua lánaimseartha i gcomhlachtaí Gaeltachta de chuid an údaráis. Is é seo an líon is airde post a cruthaíodh in aon bhliain amháin ó bhí 2008 ann. Mar chuid lárnach den phleanáil teanga sa Ghaeltacht, tá sé tugtha le fios ag Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil athbhreithniú idir lámha aige ar na córais agus an cur chuige atá in áit ag an eagraíocht maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ina gcliantchomhlachtaí. Tá trí chéim aitheanta ag an údarás san obair athbhreithnithe inmheánach seo atá ar siúl agus ar cuireadh tús leis anuraidh. Bhain an chéad chéim le athbhreithniú ar riachtanais na heagraíochta mar a bhaineann sé le cothú na teanga i gcliantchomhlachtaí agus ar na córais riaracháin agus tuairiscithe inmheánacha atá i bhfeidhm le pleananna teanga a aontú agus le monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm na bpleananna teanga sin. Fostaíodh an comhlacht comhairleoireachta Meas Media le tabhairt faoin obair seo i gcomhair le feidhmeannaigh an údaráis. Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an chéad chéim den athbhreithniú críochnaithe agus go bhfuil céimeanna tógtha chun tús a chur le moltaí an athbhreithnithe a chur i bhfeidhm. I measc na moltaí a tháinig as an gcéad chuid den athbhreithniú bhí: an gá atá le pleananna teanga a aontú ag tabhairt san áireamh riachtanais an chliaint féin, an ceantar ina bhfuil siad lonnaithe, an margadh ar a bhfuil siad dírithe agus an earnáil ina bhfuil siad ag feidhmiú; agus an gá atá le tacaíochtaí breise agus nuálaíoch a thairiscint chun na cliantchomhlachtaí a spreagadh agus a mhealladh leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa ghnó go hinmheánach agus go seachtrach. Tá tús curtha leis an dara gné den obair le roinnt seachtainí anuas. Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an comhlacht taighde Brioclage fostaithe agus ag tabhairt faoi thaighde a dhéanamh ar na cliantchomhlachtaí féin agus a gcuid fostaithe. Baileofar eolas agus tuairimí uathu a bheidh mar bhunús do chlár tacaíochta nua a bheidh le forbairt. Beidh an clár seo dírithe ar na cliaint a mhealladh agus a spreagadh chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus a chur chun cinn ina ngnólachtaí go hinmheánach agus go seachtrach. Bainfidh an tríú gné den obair athbhreithnithe seo le cur i bhfeidhm na moltaí a thiocfaidh ón obair thaighde seo ar na cliantchomhlachtaí agus le forbairt ábhair agus tacaíochtaí breise a bheidh mar chuidiú leis na spriocanna thuas a bhaint amach. Agus an obair seo uile curtha i gcrích ag an údarás, tacaíodh sé leis an obair den scoth atá ar bun ag na pobail Ghaeltachta ar mhaithe leis an teanga a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile. Tá an próiseas pleanála teanga faoi bhláth sa Ghaeltacht anois de bharr obair mo Roinne, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Fhoras na Gaeilge agus na bpobal Gaeltachta ach go háirithe. Mar atá léirithe in obair an údaráis, osclóidh an próiseas deiseanna eile chun an teanga a fhorbairt i réimsí agus earnálacha nua. Tá muidne sa Roinn ag súil leis an deis tógáil ar an obair atá déanta go nuige seo ar mhaithe leis an leas is mó don Ghaeltacht a fháscadh amach as an bpróiseas. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh siad sult as Seachtain na Gaeilge.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is é sin an suim atá againn sa Ghaeilge.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad this evening to speak on tourism. Sular bhuail ráig Covid-19 an domhan bhí turasóireacht ar cheann de na hearnálacha ba mhó agus ba thapúla fás sa gheilleagar domhanda agus chuir sí go mór le cúrsaí eacnamaíocha agus sóisialta in go leor tíortha, cathracha agus réigiún. Tourism has proven to be a vital industry in Ireland that sustains communities and drives regional development in a manner that other sectors cannot match. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad, generating a positive impression of Irish people, our landscape and culture for our visitors. The tourism landscape has changed drastically in the past two years. The outbreak and spread of Covid-19 have had a devastating impact on the tourism industry in Ireland and across the world. The pandemic struck Irish tourism towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 by which stage only 10% to 15% of annual overseas spending would have accrued. After the first quarter, there was a collapse in overseas travel and the OECD estimates that international tourism worldwide fell by 80% overall that year. During this time, the Government committed to providing supports for the sectors worst affected by the crisis, including tourism. A tourism recovery task force was established in May 2020 and delivered a tourism recovery plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector could adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment. Later that year, I appointed a recovery oversight group to oversee the implementation of this plan. This group has reported regularly to me and has provided valuable inputs to the Government on the measures required to assist the sector. The recovery oversight group is continuing its work and will continue to report with updates on the implementation of the recovery plan and recovery in the sector more generally. In 2020, more than €44 million was allocated to deliver business continuity supports and adaptation grants for the tourism sector to adapt premises to meet Covid-19 safety requirements. In 2021, we saw a short and successful summer season from a domestic tourism point of view, but given the consequential and necessary public health measures that were put in place, many of the jobs supported by tourism were either lost or their survival hinged on State support. A full recovery in the sector was further hampered by the fact that inbound overseas tourism could not fully recommence. In budget 2021, I secured a record level of funding for tourism overall that included €55 million for a dedicated tourism business continuity scheme to help strategic tourism businesses survive the pandemic and drive recovery. This funding was supplemented by the outdoor dining scheme 2021 and the urban animation scheme 2021, which allowed Fáilte Ireland to deliver a number of targeted capital grant schemes to help tourism businesses adapt to the changed operating environment. A further €50 million was secured from budget 2022 for additional business continuity supports and a €35 million increase to the tourism marketing fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. This current investment is complemented by significant capital investment and I was very pleased to have been able to secure a large capital allocation of €36.5 million to Fáilte Ireland for tourism product development in budget 2022. I am continuing to engage closely with the wider tourism and hospitality sector, in close consultation with the Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. Throughout the pandemic, tourism enterprises have also benefited from wider horizontal supports such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, restart grants, the €2 billion Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme and the €16 million support package for pubs, bars and nightclubs, as well as the warehousing of tax liabilities. There is no doubt that the past two years have proven to be extremely difficult for all involved in tourism but hopefully the worst effects of the pandemic are behind us. While the outlook is certainly better now, we must remain conscious of the further challenges that lie ahead. Like many sectors of the economy, recruitment is a significant challenge for the tourism and hospitality sectors, with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages. In February, Fáilte Ireland published its most comprehensive research to date on the tourism and hospitality labour market. This robust and wide-ranging research programme covers the views of 1,000 employers and 3,500 workers with tourism and hospitality experience as well as international benchmarking, a review of education provision and consultation with recruitment agencies. This research is shaping Fáilte Ireland's work programmes for this year which will focus on providing support to the industry to address the immediate labour and skills supply challenges which will be critical to the short-term recovery of the sector; supporting businesses and the wider industry to work together to drive the long-term repositioning of the industry as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace, and ensuring a future pipeline of talent; and building the capability of individual employees to help businesses to bridge the skills gaps they are experiencing and also drive greater employee retention by improving the quality of training across the business. Fáilte Ireland also chairs the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, which will continue to work closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives, as well as focusing on the long-term repositioning of the industry as a career choice. The tragic events in Ukraine also have the potential to impede the recovery of overseas tourism to Ireland. The recent spike in oil prices and rising inflation are making accommodation and transport services more expensive, adding extra pressure on businesses, consumer purchasing power and savings. It is important to remember, however, that our research tells us that Ireland's reputation as a safe, friendly and welcoming country will be a valuable asset in the short, medium and long term. With specific regard to the ensuing refugee crisis, Ireland has welcomed more than 18,000 Ukrainian refugees to date. Planning and preparatory work is being ramped up across government to provide supports to those who have arrived here already, as well as the large numbers of further people expected to arrive. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are continuing to work with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to identify longer term accommodation options beyond the hotel sector. As Senators know, President Zelenskyy will address this House and the Dáil tomorrow morning. I look forward to hearing his historic address and I have no doubt that Irish people will continue to play their part in the humanitarian response to this horrific and unjust war. Ireland firmly stands in solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. As we enter the recovery phase for tourism, the competition globally to attract tourists will be more challenging than ever and I am more than confident that Tourism Ireland is equally equipped for and up for the challenge. To this end, Tourism Ireland has started to roll out the green carpet and welcome back international visitors as they work to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept revolves around creating a commitment to travel, by pressing the "Green Button" - green being the universal colour signifying "go" and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new Green Button campaign in the United Kingdom, the United States and the United Arab Emirates in recent months when I travelled to all three markets to engage with our industry partners and reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors. During those trade missions, I saw at first-hand the excellent work undertaken by Tourism Ireland in highlighting Ireland's world-class tourism experience to international tour operators. The importance of tourism to the economy on both sides of the Border and the clear logic in taking a joint approach to the promotion and development of the sector led to tourism being one of the areas chosen for formal North-South co-operation, through the structures created by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. That co-operation has been hugely beneficial, with the tourism sector now an exemplar of what can be achieved when we work together on this island with a shared purpose and for clear mutual benefit. In January, I took part in a shared island dialogue event hosted by the Department of An Taoiseach, which focused on all-island tourism.More than 160 tourism and civil society stakeholders from across the island joined the event online to discuss the success of tourism co-operation on the island of Ireland over the past 20 years, and explore how best to enhance opportunities for domestic and international visitors in the years ahead. Over the course of the dialogue a number of key themes emerged, including the opportunity for greater alignment and linkages between tourism initiatives on the island, and further developing on a cross-Border basis the on-island tourism that has grown in response to the pandemic travel restrictions. My Department will continue to work with the Department of An Taoiseach on implementing our commitments to the North-South development of tourism as included in the shared island chapter of the renewed national development plan. This includes supporting Tourism Ireland in its mission to grow tourism into the island of Ireland; promoting the recovery of the sector post pandemic; and working with the Northern Ireland Executive, when it is restored, on developing large scale North-South tourism initiatives which will support the sustainable growth of the sector, including cross-Border walking and cycling trails, as well as new marketing opportunities. As part of its marketing strategy this year, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to restart, rebuild and, ultimately, redesign demand. Over €80 million will be invested in the programme in 2022, which will allow Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets. Fáilte Ireland is doubling its domestic marketing investment in 2022 to drive domestic demand, including short breaks all year round. In that regard, it has embarked on extensive marketing and communications campaigns, including its Keep Discovering campaign, which continues to encourage domestic holidaymakers to take vacations in Ireland, particularly during quieter shoulder seasons. With specific regard to capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a sustainable tourism sector from an environmental, social and economic perspective. The new NDP provides for the delivery of enhanced amenity through investment in tourism product development. Priority areas for tourism capital investment include the development and enhancement of tourist attractions, and activity-based tourism, to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors seek. Air access is a good measure of recovery and an indicator of future international tourism demand. As things currently stand, inbound air access from almost all overseas tourism markets is back close to where it stood pre pandemic. Last week, I visited Meitheal in Killarney, Ireland's biggest business-to-business international travel trade fair, and witnessed firsthand the pent-up demand in the inbound tourism sector. Closer to home domestic tourism is set to return to pre-pandemic levels this year. As we begin to regrow our tourism sector, it has never been more important that we ensure the sector's future development is based on a sustainable and balanced approach. Environmental protection, economic competitiveness, community and visitor awareness and involvement all play a part in successfully achieving and benefiting from this approach. Both public bodies and private enterprises must continue to ensure that these principles are central to our tourism offering in order to maximise the future competitiveness of Ireland as a leading sustainable tourism destination. Late last year I brought to Government a report developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group that identifies key actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices in the short term. This year our tourism agencies will focus on the delivery of this interim action plan which will enhance evidence-based decision-making for effective reduction of the tourism carbon footprint. The successful implementation of this plan will lay the foundations for a green transition of the tourism industry, and our destinations by providing better access to information and tools for visitors to practise responsible tourism and give tourism businesses and destinations the ability to measure the impact that tourism has on the environment. In line with the programme for Government commitments, officials in my Department have commenced the development of a new national tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve consultation to help set out a path for the coming years, which will support a sustainable recovery and enhance the resilience of this vital sector. It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing. The development of this new national tourism policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want in the years ahead. Overall, we are returning to a good place with tourism in Ireland. The outlook has changed considerably after some very difficult times over the last two years. While I am conscious of the further challenges we face, I am confident that, with the ongoing support of Government, we will regrow and reshape our tourism ecosystem in a smart way that will ensure resilience and sustainability as tourism reinforces itself once again as one of our most important indigenous economic sectors. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as a gcuid ama inniu. Ba mhaith liom mo thiomantas do chur chun cinn an chláir oibre turasóireachta inbhuanaithe a athdhearbhú agus táim ag tnúth le haistriú glas ár n-earnáil agus ár n-áiteanna turasóireachta.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their comments and kind words on the launch of the pilot basic income scheme for the arts today. I will address as many matters as possible in the time given to me. If I do not reach a specific question, my officials will follow up with the relevant Senators. Senators Garvey and Conway asked about the plan for the Cliffs of Moher and I will speak with Fáilte Ireland about that before following up with the Senators. Senator Garvey asked about ferries access and I will liaise with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the matter because it comes under his remit. The Senator also mentioned the sustainable tourism working group and one of the matters being progressed with that is evidence-based targets. Senator Keogan spoke about visas and Senator Byrne may have touched on the issue as well. That comes under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but it is relevant to my sector and I will continue to liaise with the Tánaiste on the matter. Senator Keogan also spoke about business and tourism and I fully support Fáilte Ireland's efforts in that area. I am attending a conference on it this Friday to lend my support to such efforts in a visible way. Senator Keogan also mentioned Dublin Airport and I know the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has been holding daily briefings with the chief executive officer of the airport and other senior DAA staff. It has implemented a number of measures recently and informed the Minister of State that these have improved the immediate position significantly. It appears that queue times at the weekend, for example, were substantially shorter than the previous weekend, with 95% of passengers through terminal 2 on Sunday having to queue for less than 35 minutes and 100% queued for less than 45 minutes. At terminal 1, 87% queued for less than 35 minutes and 92% queued for less than 45 minutes. The Minister of State will, of course, continue to monitor the position. Senators Conway, Keogan, Byrne, Cassells, Carrigy and Murphy spoke about skills shortages. On the question of staffing, my Department and Fáilte Ireland continue to collaborate with the industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages. The additional fund I have obtained for tourism in the 2022 budget will allow for targeted investment in human capital, skills development and education to help address particular employment challenges faced by tourism. It is about tracking talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. Fáilte Ireland has an extensive plan in place to support the tourism industry and address both its immediate and longer term recruitment challenges to ensure businesses can recover. I will continue to support the industry alongside the Fáilte Ireland agency to address that immediate crisis in skills supply. There are included initiatives, such as a marketing campaign to drive up awareness of jobs in the sector, a range of supports to build the industry's recruitment capabilities and the new transition year work placement programme to provide tourism and hospitality businesses with a direct link to students looking for work experience. There is also a programme to support businesses in accessing people on the live register via the Government's new Pathways to Work strategy. Businesses will also be linked with local third level students and in co-operation with the industry, there will be an effort to link with industry to identify the international markets with the best potential for pools of talent, as well as the most effective labour access points. Senator Keogan mentioned sustainable tourism. Under the arts section of the Department, we are working on the arts and festival piece. It was mentioned in the recommendations of the arts and culture recovery task force. There is a real desire in the arts sector to "green" the festivals. On the tourism aspect, we have measures that we hope will shine a light on areas and destinations at home that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools. The tourism industry needs tools to help visitors to practise responsible tourism and I see real potential in how we reshape and reimagine tourism post-Covid. We see how the domestic market will thrive and there is a yearning for the outdoors. Tourism Ireland had done great work on this and we need tourists to leave the cities and go into the hidden heartlands to use our blueways, cycleways and walkways. The potential is massive, particularly when we take in our food industry. Everything is there for the taking when it comes to sustainable tourism and we will work on that in our new plan. As I said, our officials have already commenced development of the new national tourism policy that will mainstream such sustainability. I absolutely share Senator Warfield's enthusiasm for and interest in breathing new life into the night-time economy. I see tourism and cultural benefits in doing that and in all the Senator suggests, including the opening of spaces for arts and culture. As he knows, we are doing substantial work on the night-time economy area and I have a great working relationship with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who is very supportive of that. I will share with her the specific suggestions the Senator made today about the licensing system because it is under her remit. I was delighted to support the outdoor dining measures that were mentioned by Senator Wall, along with the tourism projects he mentioned in Kildare. To respond to Senator Ward, I will speak with Fáilte Ireland as I know it has plans to promote the wider Dublin region. There is much to offer in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, although I noticed he only mentioned what is in his own part of the locality. He is not here but I will mention the facilities in my part of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, from Glencullen, Dundrum and Stepaside to Goatstown, Stillorgan and Churchtown. The list may be endless. We have promotions and sights to see there as well. I will mention his comments to Fáilte Ireland and speak with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about a cycleway. I will also speak to the Minister about Senator Lombard's query about Dublin Port. Senator Lombard mentioned Airbnb in reference to Housing for All. Overall responsibility for delivery of that plan rests with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage but we have a lead role in the implementation of Action 20.4, relating to the new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with Fáilte Ireland. I have engaged with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the matter and Fáilte Ireland has had significant engagement with the Residential Tenancies Board in the final quarter of 2021. My officials meet on an ongoing basis with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as Fáilte Ireland. Funding was allocated in the 2022 budget to Fáilte Ireland, which is being tasked with the design and implementation of the short-term lettings registration system and the agency is currently recruiting staff to work on the project with the project lead in place. My officials are also working on scoping the legislative provisions that will be required to underpin the system with a view to these provisions being enacted this year. Senators Carrigy, Conway, Murphy and O'Loughlin raised the question of VAT. I know the sector is concerned about the matter and is seeking an extension of the reduced VAT rate. I have pressed for an extension of the reduction of the VAT rate beyond August 2022 but the very strong support package I secured in the 2022 budget is already assisting the tourism sector to get firmly back on its feet in the summer. Taxation is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and he has commented that the extension provides support for those eight months to the end of the 2022 summer season, allowing a longer period of recovery for tourism. Should the economic position on tourism demand alter, he has said the VAT rate applicable to tourism will be reviewed as part of the budgetary cycle. I was glad to hear Senator O'Loughlin's report of the positive outlook for key Kildare tourism destinations, especially with the Great Britain market, which is one of our most important tourism markets.I see the huge potential of the bank holiday of St. Brigid from a spiritual and a feminist point of view. Our officials are working on how best to celebrate that bank holiday and drive the tourism market as well.  Senators Conway and Carrigy raised the issue of Fáilte Ireland board appointments. There are currently four vacancies on the board of Fáilte Ireland. The previous chairperson resigned on 15 August, with three further board resignations in September 2020, November 2020 and November 2021, respectively. Mr. Paul Carty, a previous ordinary board member, was appointed chairperson in February 2022, which has resulted in a further ordinary board member vacancy. The terms of office for four further ordinary board members were due to expire on 27 May 2022 but all four have been reappointed for a second term of two years' duration after 27 May. The process for filling the four existing vacancies has now commenced. It could not proceed until the chairperson vacancy was filled and the four reappointments were confirmed. It is open to anybody from any sector to apply for appointment to the board. Senators Byrne, Murphy and Carrigy raised the issue of domestic marketing. Fáilte Ireland is doubling its domestic marketing target in 2022 to drive domestic demand for short breaks all year around. It will also delivery four new regional tourism strategies, setting out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for each vision. It aims to ensure that tourism businesses are visible, searchable and most importantly bookable through its digital that delivers programme. It remains focused on helping businesses to promote Ireland as an international destination but it is domestic tourism that is the focus. Fáilte Ireland estimates that domestic tourism will be back to 2019 levels this summer. Overall, I think we can agree that tourism has turned a corner, thankfully. When I was at the trade event, Meitheal, in Killarney last week, the interest arising from that pent-up demand was phenomenal. We can expect a very good summer and bookings for next year. I was very proud of the various regions that were on display at Meitheal. Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland did a stellar job, as they always do. I believe that with the right support and direction, we can begin to reshape and regrow our tourism sector. However, we have to be careful not to grow just for the sake of growing. We have seen in the recent past that such growth can be unsustainable. We must grow in a way that means that future generations will also benefit from Ireland as a tourist destination, whether as visitors or as part of the industry.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for tabling the amendments. In respect of amendment No. 1, section 9D(1) of the Official Languages Act 2003 as amended provides that the name of a statutory body established on and from the commencement of section 4 of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 shall be in the Irish language. In advance of the commencement in section 4 of the 2021 Act, I decided that what was previously to be known as the media commission should be known as Coimisiún na Meán. This is given effect in section 6(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of this Bill and reflects Government policy regarding the title of new statutory bodies. That section of the Act also provides that throughout the Act coimisiún na meán is referred to as "the Commission". This is an interpretative provision rather than a substantive one.However, I absolutely understand the intention behind amendment No. 1, namely, to delete all references to "Commission" and substitute the term "Coimisiún". Given the amendment as drafted may not give effect to that intention, I do not intend to accept the amendment. However, I am willing to consider the intention further in the context of Report Stage. Similarly, amendment No. 6 would delete the term "Commissioner", as the Senator said, and replace it with the term "Coimisinéir" in section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 3 of this Bill. Again, I understand the intention of the amendment is to require a commissioner to be known as a coimisinéir but am not sure the amendment as drafted would achieve that intention and, therefore, will not accept the amendment. I am willing to consider the intention further in the context of Report Stage. The issue is fundamentally a technical drafting issue and I am willing to bring it back on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will make a general point first. I empathise with Senator Ruane on the groupings, which I also received quite late this afternoon. That is because of the interest in this groundbreaking legislation and how there are more than 200 amendments. If it is of any help, I will say that I was under the same stress as the Senator this afternoon when preparing for this debate because I was also waiting for the groupings. We were in it together. I will first speak to the Bill in general terms. The main aim of the legislation is to jump-start the modernisation of Ireland's approach to the regulation of content in traditional editorial media as well as in the landscape of newer online services fuelled by user-generated content. This is driven by the changes in the way we consume media and the growth of the online world. In terms of online safety, the Bill will ensure that we are all exposed to far less harmful online content and will require by law that online services respond to and robustly deal with complaints. While the Bill does not, and cannot, address every issue of concern arising from the online world, it creates a robust and adaptable framework for accountability that can be amended and expanded over time. This framework will be enforced by coimisiún na meán, which will include the online safety commissioner and have one of the most modern and robust suites of regulatory power in Irish law. It will be the starting point for the regulation of harmful online content. The establishment of coimisiún na meán is the most vital part of the Bill. Regarding broadcasters and streaming services, the Bill is fundamentally about modernising the regulatory environment and enabling an coimisiún to deal with the continuing changes in how we engage with and support our media. It has critical EU law dimensions, as it transposes the revised audiovisual and media services directive, AVMSD, which strongly informs an coimisiún's underpinnings. As Senators will be aware, given the complexity of this legislation, we have missed the deadline's transposition deadline. That is one of the reasons I am keen to see this Bill progress through the Houses to enactment as soon as possible. Reference was made to the EU's Digital Services Act. That Act and this Bill are complementary. One of the Bill's key drivers is the implementation of the revised AVMSD into law. That implementation in respect of online services, specifically video sharing platforms, is provided for under the Bill's regulatory framework on online safety. In this regard, the directive is explicitly recognised by the Digital Services Act as a distinct and complementary law to the proposed regulation. Regarding the regulation of other online services, the Bill provides for a regulatory framework for online safety that is designed to be adaptable and responsive to changes in Irish and EU law. Political agreement on the Digital Services Act was reached on 22 April. While the final text of the agreed legislation is not yet available, it is clear that legislation in addition to the Bill before us will be necessary to ensure appropriate alignment of our regulatory systems – coimisiún na meán and other regulators – with the proposed regulation. Ireland and other member states will have 15 months from when the regulation comes into effect – that will likely happen this summer – to ensure that its measures are provided for and supported by Irish law where necessary. In this regard, the Government has decided that coimisiún na meán, which is to be established by this Bill, will act as the primary regulator and digital services co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act. The Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the Act, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise in implementation and enforcement. It is important to note that the Digital Services Act is not sector-specific legislation, but a horizontal instrument that aims to set baseline regulatory standards across a wide range of issues, including legal liability, consumer protection in legal products, copyright, certain law enforcement matters etc. As such, it will overlap with a number of laws and activities of a number of regulatory bodies. These matters will need to be teased out during the implementation period. A programme of work in this regard already is under way between my officials and the officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Regarding the amendments, I thank the Senators for addressing the Bill's provisions on the prohibition of broadcasting or making available on the catalogues of video-on-demand services advertising that is directed towards a political end, has any relation to an industrial dispute or addresses the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation. These provisions have been carried over from existing provisions set out in sections 41(3) and 41(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which in turn carried over similar provisions from the Radio and Television Act 1988. This Bill extends those provisions to video-on-demand services. I thank Senators Ruane and Higgins for tabling amendments Nos. 2, 101 and 106. These amendments propose to replace the term "political end" with "political purposes" and set out a definition of "political purposes". I recognise the work that Senator Ruane has done on this matter, including by introducing the Electoral (Civil Society Freedom) (Amendment) Bill 2019. The effect of amendments Nos. 2, 101 and 106 would be to prohibit the broadcasting or making available of an advertisement towards political purposes rather than the current wording of an advertisement "towards a political end". The phrase "political end" was queried.That term, "an advertisement towards a political end", has been in defined in the 1998 High Court judgment, Colgan v. Independent Radio and Television Commission. This case involved an appeal against the decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC, to prohibit broadcasters from broadcasting an anti-abortion advertisement prepared by the organisation Youth Defence. The definition used in Colgan v. IRTC is currently used by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. I note that the definition of "political purposes" stems from the centre’s proposal to amend section 22(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997. Given that the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which will regulate online political advertisements during electoral periods, uses the term "political purposes" to define such advertisements, I will need to consult with my colleagues and the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform. This substantive impact of the proposed impacts in opening up political advertisement on broadcasting or video on-demand services would need to be carefully considered, particularly as regard to any unintended effects it may have in terms of potentially allowing extremists to advertise.  On amendments Nos. 2, 101 and 106, I would like to have the opportunity to consider them further and consult with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, with a view to discussing the matter again on Report Stage, so the Senators may wish to raise the amendments then. Amendment No. 100, as proposed by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, would have the effect of deleting section 46(2) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which would appear to have the effect of allowing all political advertising or religious advertisements to be broadcast or shown on a video on-demand service. I would have concerns that this may have the inadvertent effect of allowing political parties to advertise outside of election periods on television and certain video on-demand services. As we have seen in other jurisdictions, allowing political parties to advertise freely can actually have the effect of handing the airwaves over to the political parties that have the most resources. At its most dangerous, this would have the potential to undermine the democratic process.  On lifting the ban on industrial disputes, the employer may have a higher level of resources to influence public opinion. Therefore, I would be inclined to agree with Senator Sherlock on the risks that she outlined. The amendment as proposed would remove the prohibition of broadcasting political advertisements, but not put the rules in place. Therefore, it would not be a level playing pitch. There would be rules for online advertising under the Electoral Reform Bill in the election period, but not for broadcasting. I would be afraid we are actually moving beyond the core function of the commission. Therefore, I cannot accept amendment No. 100.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 establishes the regulator, which the Government has decided will also enforce the DSA. I am advised that it is important to have that regulator in place at an early stage and that is why we are doing that now. The Bill also creates a regulatory framework for online safety, which is designed to be future-proofed and adaptable to EU law. This framework will help the implementation of the DSA, not hinder it. Senator Higgins mentioned the online safety commissioner. There are later amendments that will provide an opportunity to discuss that point. I wish to tell Senators Higgins and Ruane that I have given serious consideration to amendments Nos. 101 and 106 and to returning to them on Report Stage in consultation with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. On amendment No. 100, I have concerns about the risks that there would be unintentional consequences to deleting section 46M(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended, and so I cannot accept it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the amendments brought by Senators Higgins and Ruane. The Senators have identified a potential ambiguity in the text of the Bill. Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete an existing definition and to insert a new definition stating that commercial communications shall be interpreted as including advertisements. Amendments Nos. 99, 119, 121, 122 and 172 seek to ensure that media service rules, media service codes and online safety codes address both advertisements and commercial communications. Section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 3 of the Bill, already incorporates a definition of commercial communication. I can confirm that the term "commercial communication" used within the Bill is intended to be an encompassing one, including advertising, sponsorship, teleshopping and product placement. I do understand that the intention of the Senators' amendments is to ensure that the media service codes, the media service rules and the online safety codes address all commercial communications, including advertisements. That is also the intention of the Bill as initiated. I understand the concerns of Senators that this is not immediately clear in the draft of the Bill is initiated. I will not accept the amendments today but I will ask my officials to examine Bill, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to returning to consider this on Report Stage. I again thank the Senators for their amendments. They have shown the value of parliamentary scrutiny and the importance of our legislative process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Just to say-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Senators have recognised I do not make the decision in regard to what is ruled out of order. I am happy for my officials to engage with Members between now and the next Stage of the Bill. I will also say that the Bill was written in a tech-neutral fashion, that was the advice we were given from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in regard to helping to future-proof the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. Amendment No. 9 is intended to provide the power to an coimisiún to compel any technology company to produce data or reports when questioned. I note this amendment is drafted quite broadly without specifying any framework by which an coimisiún would compel technology companies to produce such reports. I believe the power to compel the provision of information from regulated entities is adequately assigned to an coimisiún through the Bill as published. An coimisiún has the power to compel information from video-on-demand services. Part 3A of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides for the establishment of a register of video-on-demand services established in the State, which is a requirement of the revised audiovisual media service directive. Section 46D of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may request further information from a media service provider where the provider notifies an coimisiún that it should be entered onto the register or where the provider is required to change its details on the register. Under section 46F of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, if the media service provider does not provide the information requested, an coimisiún may direct the media service provider to comply with the request. If the media service provider fails to comply with a direction, it shall be deemed guilty of an offence under the Broadcasting Act. An coimisiún has the power to require information from a relevant online service. Under the Bill, a relevant online service may be any information society service, which covers a vast array of technology companies, from Internet service providers to social media services. The regulatory structure for online safety in the Bill operates by providing an coimisiún the power to designate relevant online services and subject them to online safety codes. To facilitate an coimisiún making the decision to designate an online service, section 139F of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 44 of the Bill, provides an coimisiún with the power to require the provider of a relevant online service to provide an coimisiún with any information necessary to designate the provider for regulation. Where a provider fails to comply with such a requirement to provide information, it shall be deemed guilty of an offence under the Broadcasting Act. When a relevant online service is designated for regulation, it is known as a designated online service under the Bill. Section 139O of the Broadcasting Act 2009, inserted by section 44 of this Bill, allows the commission to require a provider of a designated online service to provide the commission with information relating to the provider's compliance with an online safety code. Under this section, the commission may require the information to be provided within seven days, rather than one calendar month, as the amendment suggests. Moreover, this section provides that it is an offence if the provider fails without reasonable excuse to comply or provides false information knowing that it is false or being reckless as to whether it is false. Section 139O provides that the commission may exercise this power following notification by a member of the super complaints scheme provided by section 139U of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 44 of the Bill. Accordingly, the provisions sought by this amendment are already covered in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. Amendment No. 10 amends section 7(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of this Bill, to insert specific reference to the role of an coimisiún in protecting rights to privacy and reputation. The purpose of section 7(2) is to set out the various matters an coimisiún shall seek to ensure in the performance of its functions. I have some concerns regarding a specific reference to the role of an coimisiún in upholding rights to privacy and reputation. These rights are protected through the Constitution in the form of the requirement of the State to protect the good name of every citizen in the form of judgments of our courts and the recognition that the right to privacy is inherent in the personal rights set out in the Constitution. These rights are also protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. I am somewhat wary of inserting language in the Bill that would imply that any of the specific personal rights contained in the Constitution, the charter or the convention on human rights were pre-eminent in some way on other personal rights provisions. I also note that protection and vindication of the right to privacy and reputation are set out in other legislative instruments, specifically the Data Protection Act 2018 and the general data protection regulation in respect of privacy, and the Defamation Act 2009 regarding reputation. A reference to the rights to privacy and reputation may give rise to the expectation that vindicating or protecting these rights is a specific function of the commission and that these rights should have a greater importance than other rights, including others set out in the Constitution, charter and convention. While I will not accept amendment No. 10, I commit to reflecting further on its intent, with a view to considering it further in the context of Report Stage. Amendment No. 11 proposes to amend section 7(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to provide that the interests of the public and, in particular, children would be promoted as well as protected. The question is whether amendment No. 11 would substantially affect the manner in which an coimisiún performs its duties. I absolutely understand the intent of the Senator in seeking to expand the language. However, I am advised that the term "protection", which is already provided for in the Bill in the context of the interests of the public and children, may also encompass the term "promotion" in this context. Again, I do not propose to accept the amendment today, but instead I commit to giving it further consideration in the context of Report Stage. Amendment No. 12 would also amend subsection 2 to provide for a separate paragraph on the protection of the interests and safety of children. The protection of the rights and interests of children is an objective that all of us in these Houses share. It will be a key component of the work of an coimisiún, particularly in the context of making online safety codes to tackle the prevalence of harmful online content. The key consideration is also whether the amendment would substantially affect the manner in which an coimisiún performs its duties, in particular with regard to the protection of children. Amendment No. 12 is another proposal that I wish to have more time to examine further with a view to returning to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have agreed to reflect seriously and further on these three amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator. I see the value of adding "inclusive" in there and ensuring broadcast and video-on-demand services are not only open and pluralistic but are open, inclusive and pluralistic. As the Minister with responsibility for culture as well as for media, I have always sought to open up participation in our cultural life to all our citizens in all their diversity. I am therefore happy to accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for his amendments. Amendment No. 14 to the new section 7(2)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 proposed in section 7 of the Bill deletes a reference to the languages and traditions of the people of the island and Ireland and replaces it with a reference to "the duty not only to satisfy existing demand but to stimulate increased demand for Irish language programming and content, in line with the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language nationwide". I am not sure that was the intended effect of the amendment. It may have been intended to amend the new section 7(2)(d), which provides that an coimisiún shall, in performing its functions, endeavour to ensure that regulatory arrangements address various matters. I am not in favour of deleting the reference to the languages and traditions of the people of the island of Ireland. That is an important provision in the new section 7(2)(c) as it is important that the policies of an coimisiún in relation to broadcasting and video on-demand services bear in mind all of the diverse languages and traditions on our island. I cannot accept amendment No. 14. Amendment No. 22 amends section 7(3)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill. This section currently provides that an coimisiún shall:promote and stimulate the development of—(i) programmes in the Irish language, and(ii) programmes relating to climate change and environmental sustainabilityThe amendment would change the words "promote and stimulate" to "ensure and increase the development and provision of" such programmes. I am strongly in favour of increasing the availability of Irish language programming. That is why I allocated additional funding to TG4. In budget 2021, I secured an additional €3.5 million and, in budget 2022, I secured an additional €4.2 million for TG4. As regards the role of an coimisiún, I am satisfied that the language of promoting and encouraging is sufficient to ensure the production of programming in the Irish language. I am worried that the replacing the term "promote and stimulate" with "ensure and increase" would imply that an coimisiún, as regulator, could impinge on the editorial independence of a broadcaster or video on-demand service in a manner not set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. I do not propose to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 23 amends section 7(3)(e) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to require an coimisiún to promote and encourage increased use of the Irish language in the policies and practices of broadcasting, video on-demand and relevant online services. I am conscious that the amendment would apply not only to broadcasting and video on-demand services, but also to relevant online services. As set out in section 3(2)(t) of the Bill, a relevant online service may be any information society service. This covers a vast array of technology companies from Internet service providers to social media services. Relevant online services are effectively the pool of services that, following an appropriate risk analysis, an coimisiún may designate for regulation and the application of online safety codes. I am concerned about the impact of this amendment on services whose content is primarily user-generated and on relevant online services that may be less likely to be designated for regulation, such as Internet service providers. I do not think the impact of this amendment is clear, although I understand its intention. I do not propose to accept it today but I will ask my officials to reflect further on it.  Amendment No. 30 has the effect of providing that an coimisiún may undertake strategic reviews of the sectors it regulates in respect of broadcasting in the Irish language. I again propose not to accept the amendment today but to consider it in the context of Report Stage. Amendment No. 228 proposes to amend the Title of the Bill to insert the words “to increase the visibility and use of Irish as a spoken language in media and public life and ensure a diversity of content for the Irish-speaking community;”.The amendment amends the Title, stating that an objective of the Bill is “to increase the visibility and use of Irish as a spoken language in media and public life and ensure a diversity of content for the Irish-speaking community;”. Any proposals to amend the Title of a Bill must be considered carefully. For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment today but will return to it on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. I wish to bring to their attention, in terms of issues that I raised about these amendments and the previous group, that section 460 refers to media service rules that enable the media commission to make rules regarding accessibility, including regarding sign language service provision. It also gives effect to the provision of the AV media services to increase accessibility to media services for persons with disabilities. Amendment No. 15 would add linguistic diversity to other areas of the diversity of the people of the island of Ireland that is set out in the section. This is an important potential addition to the Bill as it recognises the role not only of Irish and English on the island but of all other languages that are spoken and written here, and which now form part of our cultural life. I have concerns about the second part of the amendment as it seeks to change the term to "their diversity of traditions and identities". While I recognise the intent of the amendment, it may have the opposite effect to that intended by restricting the term "diversity" to that of "diversity of traditions and identities" rather than all of the other forms of diversity of the people of the island of Ireland.For that reason, I will not accept the amendment today, but I propose to return to it on Report Stage. Amendment No. 16 seeks to amendment section 7(2)(c)(iii) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, by adding an additional form of diversity. In this case, it would add socioeconomic diversity to the forms of diversity. As the Senators will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination based on socioeconomic disadvantaged status to the employment, equality and equal status legislation. My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, launched a review of the Equality Acts on foot of this commitment. I propose not to accept the amendment today, but I believe it could be a valuable amendment to the Bill. To ensure consistency with the work of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I will ask my officials to engage with his officials with a view to allowing further examination on Report Stage. Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 both amendment section 7(2)(c)(iv) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill. Amendment No. 17 inserts a reference to the visible representative of people with disabilities in the broadcasting and on-demand services available in the State. Amendment No. 18 inserts a reference to the right to and importance of cultural participation of people with disabilities. Both amendments would form valuable additions to the Bill. I would like further time to consider the amendments. I propose not to accept them today, but to return to them on Report Stage. Amendment No. 19 requires that the commission shall endeavour to ensure the regulatory arrangements to support equality, human rights and participation in cultural life. I agree that these are important principles in guiding the work of the commission. I thank the Senators for their amendment. I will not make the amendment today, but I will take it away for further consideration and discussion on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have given that commitment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for tabling amendments Nos. 20 and 21, which would have the effect of requiring the commission to endeavour to ensure that regulators take account of societal and environmental matters. Addressing climate change and environmental degradation is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It will impact not only the media sector, but our entire society. It is important for the commission to consider these matters. That is why section 7(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, requires the commission to consider "policies of the Government and of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of climate change and environmental sustainability." Would amendments Nos. 20 and 21 have a similar effect to the existing provisions? I ask the Senator for more time to reflect on this. I will return to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. Section 7(3)(f) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, is designed to ensure that the commission will play a strong role in encouraging research and in promoting or endorsing education initiatives, including by co-operation for that purpose with education bodies and in promoting public awareness, knowledge and understanding to matters connected to its functions. This section is designed to ensure that an coimisiún and specifically the online safety commissioner will have a role in carrying out education initiatives such as public information campaigns and will also work with existing education bodies such as the Department of Education, Webwise.ie and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The commissioner will also be able to endorse third-party providers for online safety education materials which will help schools to source appropriate and robust online safety materials. Amendment No. 24 seeks to amend section 7(3)(f) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, to extend the requirement of an coimisiún to encourage, promote and endorse education initiatives to cover the evaluation and approval of education initiatives and community awareness programmes and activities. While I understand the intention of the amendment, I have concerns about providing for any role for an coimisiún to evaluate or approve education initiatives, as that would imply a role for it in accreditation. It is not intended that an coimisiún would act as a professional accreditation body for educators similar to the Teaching Council or the Medical Council. I fear it would be an over-step into an area already led by existing educational bodies.  In considering any amendments that might expand or be seen to expand the functions of an coimisiún, I am conscious of not unduly expanding its scope into other areas of policy or other bodies or regulators with the effect that its core functions might suffer. The core functions are to enforce the new regulatory framework for online safety and the updated frameworks for video on-demand services. In that regard, it will play a very strong role in supporting education initiatives. The Bill as published sets out a very significant expansion of the role of an coimisiún in education as against the role fulfilled by the BAI. Therefore I do not intend to accept the amendment. I recognise the intention of amendment no. 25. I am of the view that the provisions of the Bill as initiated and as read at Second Stage already encompass the role envisaged by the amendment for the commission in respect of media literacy, I can see the merit in specifying the role. However, I do not think that it is appropriate to specify a role for digital literacy. That is primarily the responsibility of the Ministers for Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. They are advancing strategies such as that on the ten-year adult literacy for life and through the early years in school system. I am happy to arrange for my officials to engage with the Departments so while I reject the amendment, I welcome further discussion on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I understand the intention but my fear, particularly in the context of the phrase "evaluate and approve", was that what is envisaged in the current wording would hugely expand the role of an coimisiún and take it away from its core functions. If the Senator is willing to withdraw the amendment, I am happy to see how she might rework the wording. As already stated, we will engage between with the officials between now and Report Stage. I am happy to arrange that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Carrigy for tabling amendment No. 26. We are all aware that sportspeople are being targeted from the side of the pitch, on the athletic ground and in the stadium or arena. The problem has been particularly abhorrent in certain sports. I am acutely conscious that social media has made it much easier to target abuse at our sportspeople. That is why it would be important for Coimisiún na Meán to be established as soon as possible to allow it to begin to make binding online safety codes to tackle the prevalence of harmful online content such as cyberbullying on social media platforms. I am aware, however, that the issuance of the codes is only one part of the solution to the abuse of sportspeople. As the Senator's amendment indicates, it will be vital that an coimisiún works with bodies across different sectors such as sports, education and culture to promote online safety. It is because of the wide array of bodies with which an coimisiún will be required to work that I would be cautious about specifying any one particular body with which it must engage. Section 7 of the Bill inserts section 32 into the Broadcast Act 2009, which provides that an coimisiún may enter into co-operation agreements with a body established in the State. This section will enable the commission to engage with bodies such as the Federation of Irish Sport and, indeed, a singular national governing body, NGV, such as the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU or the Camogie Association. It would also allow for engagement with Sport Ireland as the statutory body charged with developing sport in the country. I am aware that Sport Ireland is already carrying out work in this area and has produced a staying safe online resource. Ultimately, I am reluctant to specify a role for a specific body in the Bill. As a result, I cannot accept this amendment today. Rather, I would like to see an coimisiún in a position to exercise its capacity to co-operate with bodies across multiple sectors. I propose to reject this amendment for now but to return to the matter at Report Stage, if the Senator is agreeable, and we can liaise regarding an alternative and perhaps less specific form of wording.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 7(2) of the Act, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, states the commission shall ensure the interests are protected, although I do understand the intention of the Senators' amendment. While I will not accept it, I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth regarding the wording of the proposed amendment, with a view to returning to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Senators that addiction, and in particular gambling addiction, poses a major challenge to our society, not least when it involves young people and children. That is why the establishment of a gambling regulator, focused on public safety and well-being and with the power to regulate gambling advertising on websites and apps, was a commitment in the programme for Government. As Senators will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, published the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill in October, which will establish a new gambling authority. The general scheme indicates the Bill will include a specific definition of "gambling", an exclusionary register by which persons may voluntarily exclude themselves from accessing gambling activities and provisions that will allow the gambling authority to make codes regulating the advertising of gambling. While I intend not to accept the amendment, I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Departments of Justice and Health with regard to its wording, with a view to returning to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	This amends section 7(5)(d) of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill. It provides that the commission may undertake strategic reviews of the sectors regulated by the commission in respect of the protection of workers' rights. I cannot accept the amendment for the following reasons: in the first instance, policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation. The amendment is also straying into matters that may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. In particular, section 11(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides the WRC shall conduct reviews and monitor developments as respects workplace relations. I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the commission. I understand the intention of the amendment. The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors regulated by the Bill. I acknowledge the concerns raised by the Senator regarding working conditions in the technology sector. Last May, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade union experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions. The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms. In particular, one of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved and the types of distressing content she was required to view as part of the role. The Tánaiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment. The Tánaiste also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again. It is important to stress the protection of workers' rights is not a core function of the Department or its agencies. It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy. Moving responsibility for workers' rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors. In this regard, the role will of an coimisiún as an independent regulatory body is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video on demand and designated online services. It is not intended to regulate employment relations or to assess working conditions. As a general principle in considering any amendment that might expand the functions of an coimisiún, I am conscious of not unduly expanding its scope to other areas of policy with the effect that its core functions might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have addressed these issues. I have said I cannot accept the amendment because I believe the policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I also stated I believe the amendment is straying into matters that may be more appropriate to the functions of the WRC. I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating its work. The idea of moving responsibility for workers' rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors. I will not accept the amendment today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not my intention to come back to this on Report Stage because of the reasons I have outlined. Perhaps I said "today" but I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for proposing these important amendments. The coverage by broadcasters of our democratic process, particularly during electoral periods, can have a profound impact on the outcome of the process. That is why broadcasting legislation has for many years sought to ensure fairness, objectivity and impartiality in both news coverage and the coverage of elections. This Bill will extend those provisions to the video-on-demand services, reflecting the changing way in which citizens access new media. As regards amendment No. 104, the party-political broadcast has played an important role in the democratic process by allowing political parties uncontested airtime to carry their message to the public. For that reason, these broadcasts have been exempted from the general prohibition against the broadcasting or making available of advertisements directed towards a political end. It is the intention of the Bill to continue this exemption in respect of party-political broadcasts. However, I acknowledge that the use of the term “party political programmes” in section 9 of the Bill – inserting section 46M(4) into the Broadcasting Act 2009 – rather than “party political broadcasts” may give rise to some interpretive confusion if it is not clarified. The term “party political programmes” was used in lieu of “party political broadcasts” to ensure the section covered both broadcasting services and video-on-demand services that would not be considered to make broadcasts. I have asked my officials to examine this issue with a view to returning to this House on Report Stage. I cannot promise Senators that I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage but I will certainly seek to set out any plans I have to address this issue. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 104 at this time but acknowledge the matter needs to be scrutinised closely. Amendments Nos. 31 and 96 also address an issue that goes to the heart of our democratic process, namely, the coverage by broadcasters of political parties and the methodology for determining the allocation of that coverage. Given that the allocation of coverage may play a role in determining the outcome of an election, I acknowledge that this is a contentious and controversial issue. As amendment No. 31 recognises, the BAI, under section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, has issued a code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs – rule 27 – which deals with the coverage of elections by broadcasters. Under the Bill, this code will continue in force upon the dissolution of the BAI and the establishment of the coimisiún until such time as it is replaced by a media service code, which will apply not only to broadcasters but also to certain video-on-demand services. At present, rule 27 places responsibility on broadcasters to develop mechanisms to fairly allocate coverage during elections rather than being prescriptive. This is in contrast with the current situation in Britain, where Ofcom, as the audiovisual service regulator, issues prescriptive rules to broadcasters. We have seen a transformation in the political landscape in this country over the past 12 years. I recognise that this is posing a challenge for broadcasters, particularly RTÉ in its role as our largest public service broadcaster, especially regarding the allocation of coverage during elections. Given the complexity of this issue and the difficulty in arriving at a consensus, it is preferable that any common set of requirements for broadcasters in respect of party-political broadcasts or the editorial coverage of elections and referendums be made by the coimisiún through media-service codes rather than through prescription by legislation, as suggested in amendment No. 31, which covers the election period, and amendment No. 96, which focuses on coverage across the board. On that basis, I have asked my officials to further scrutinise the provisions of section 9 of the Bill, with which we insert subsections 46L(1) to (3) and the relevant measure in 46N into the Broadcasting Act to be sure that nothing in the text of the Bill would prevent the coimisiún from setting such a common set of requirements through the media service codes. I intend to request that an coimisiún review the code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality governing news and current affairs with a view to addressing the issue of fairly allocating coverage of political parties in broadcasts and video-on-demand services, particularly during elections. In doing so, I emphasise that under this legislation an coimisiún will make any decisions concerning such codes independently of the Oireachtas and myself as Minister. Similar to the situation with amendment No. 31, although I cannot accept these amendments, I will return to the House on Report Stage to allow us to discuss this matter further.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On those two amendments just mentioned, and starting with Senator Ruane's amendment No. 107, it is similar to amendment No. 2, so I am happy to come back to that on Report Stage. I reject it today, but I am happy to come back to it on Report Stage. Regarding Senator Sherlock’s amendment No. 105, it is similar to what amendment No. 104 is seeking to do in a slightly different approach. I reject the amendment today, but we will come back to it on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I recognise that amendments Nos. 32 and 33 aim to achieve gender equality within the commission and I thank the Senators for those amendments. One of my key goals since becoming a member of Government has been to further gender equality within every sector under my remit. I am absolutely committed to empowering women and using my position to help raise women's voices and drive greater gender equality. Of particular relevance to these benefits have been my actions to ensure gender equality in the appointment to the State boards of bodies under the aegis of my Department. Senators will appreciate that I understand the objectives that the amendments seek to achieve. However, there is a difference between ensuring a gender balance in sports bodies where typically a number of board positions are filled at the same time as opposed to advertising individual commissioner posts for full-time employment where the provisions of employment law apply. There would be some risks there. Before considering the amendments further, I wish to seek legal advice as to the compatibility of the proposed amendments with the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 and 2015, particularly the provisions of the Acts that prohibit the treatment of people less favourably if one is a woman and one is a man. I do not want to insert anything in the Bill that would be contrary to employment law and, therefore, I would like to get legal advice. While I do not accept these amendments, I hope to return to this issue on Report Stage following that consultation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators. I am feeling the love in the Chamber today, among Senators themselves anyway. Taken together, I can see that the proposed amendments seek to provide a legislative underpinning for the position of an online safety commissioner with responsibility for the functions of an comisiúin relating to online safety. That, as Senators have said today, is the core point being addressed in these amendments. Section 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides for the delegation of the performance of some of the functions of an coimisiún to an individual commissioner. As such, there is nothing in the Bill to preclude an coimisiún from delegating the functions relating to online safety set out in Part 8A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to a commissioner who shall be responsible for online safety. Indeed, the delegation of the online safety functions to a dedicated online safety commissioner has actually always been the intention.  As Senators have stated, it was one of the key recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media. That report recommended an explicit legislative provision for an online safety commissioner within the Bill. This provision was not included in the Bill as initiated in this House but I do intend to provide for it by way of a Government amendment as the Bill passes through the Houses. I am pleased to advise this House that good progress has been made on the drafting of such an amendment in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. I am conscious of the feeling in the House that a Government amendment addressing this issue should, if time permits, be introduced in the Seanad. Therefore, I propose to introduce a Government amendment on Report Stage in this House explicitly providing for the position of online safety commissioner within the Bill. This would provide the Seanad with sufficient opportunity to debate and scrutinise said amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators for their amendments. It is important to note that these are not board positions but full-time regulators who will go through a rigorous process to ensure their suitability similar to the Data Protection Commissioner or ComReg. Amendment No. 37 amends section 11 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to provide that I, as Minister, would agree the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy on the commission. I believe this amendment might duplicate provisions set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, in particular section 34, which sets out the functions of the Public Appointments Service. Section 11(3) of the Broadcasting Acting 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides that the chairperson and commissioners shall be appointed by me, as Minister, on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service. One of the reasons for specifying this in the Bill is to ensure that the codes and practices, set out under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, applied to the recruitment process. The recruitment and selection processes will be closely guided by the code of practice on appointments to positions in the Civil and Public Service, which set out the application of the principles of probity, merit, best practice, fairness and transparency to the recruitment of public servants. This will ensure that the process is open, transparent and fair. My officials are working with the Public Appointments Service to develop the selection criteria for the appointment of the commissioners. I anticipate that this will involve an executive search process given the specific skillset and expertise required, which Senators have mentioned, that commissioners and particularly the online safety commissioner may require. I, as Minister, will ultimately agree the selection criteria for the post as set out in the recruitment booklet that will contain the job description and selection criteria for the role of commissioner. Given that I believe the intention set out in the amendment is already provided for in legislation, and in practice, I do not propose to accept it. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 describe some areas of knowledge, expertise and experience that both I, as Minister, and the Public Appointments Service shall seek to ensure that an coimisiún has. I agree that it would be desirable that commissioners would have collectively, or individually, some or all of the knowledge and expertise described in the amendments. However, while I recognise the intention of these amendments, I would be concerned that there is a danger in being overly prescriptive as to the knowledge and experience that members of the commission should have. So I am not persuaded of the merits of amendments Nos. 38 and 39 and, therefore, cannot accept them. Amendment No. 40 would appear to duplicate provisions already in law. I understand that section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún will already be subject to the provisions of that Act. I expect that an coimisiún would not only comply with section 42 of the Act but also, in accordance with the spirit of the Act, demonstrate a culture and practice of respect of human rights. I understand that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by the State and entered into force in 2018. I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth about the status of the convention. So while I do not propose to accept amendment No. 40 today I propose to return to the matter on Report Stage. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will return to amendment No. 40. As I stated in my contribution,I know that the convention has been ratified by the State. I do, however, want to have that engagement with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 37, 38 or 39.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe the provisions in amendments Nos. 42 and 45 are largely addressed by the Bill as published. Section 37 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, requires that a commissioner or other relevant person should not be party to a consideration of matter by an coimisiún where they, or a connected person such as a family member, may derive a benefit from that consideration or where they have an interest in a business or organisation which might also derive a benefit from that consideration. Section 37 also requires them to disclose to the commission that they may benefit from the consideration. The provisions of section 37 are designed to prevent any conflicts of interest that may arise in the course of the work of an coimisiún and to ensure the independence of an coimisiún in its consideration of matters particularly those pertaining to its regulatory functions. Amendment No. 42 would provide that a commissioner may be removed from office by the Government if he or she failed to comply with the requirements of section 37. Amendment No. 45 would provide that a commissioner would cease to hold office, were he or she to breach section 37. As I said, I believe the Bill already addresses the intentions of the amendments. Section 12(5)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, provides that the Government may remove a commissioner where he or she has a conflict of interest of such significance that he or she should cease to hold that office. Such a conflict of interest might include, for example, failure to disclose a relevant interest, such as acquiring shares in a provider of communications media with a value greater than €5,000 under section 37. If the Government does not seek to remove a commissioner for a breach of section 37, there is also provision for ministerial measures to be taken.Section 37(3) provides that where a commissioner fails to comply with section 37 by, for example, failing to disclose a relevant interest in an organisation that may benefit from a decision of an coimisiún in which the commissioner is involved then I, as Minister, shall decide the appropriate action to take. I believe that the Bill as published addresses the issues raised by the amendments. Accordingly, I do not accept amendments Nos. 42 and 45.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I have indicated already, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 42 and 45 because I believe the Bill, as published, addresses the issues raised in the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendment. Section 12 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, sets out the conditions of office of a commissioner. The section also provides, as we discussed in relation to the preceding amendments, that the Government may remove a commissioner in very specific circumstances. Given the gravity of such a decision and to meet the requirements of natural justice, this section sets out very clear steps for removing a commissioner.The Government must give a notice in writing of a statement proposing to remove a commissioner to that commissioner, setting out very clearly the reasons for the proposed removal and providing an opportunity for the commissioner to make representations to the Government. Section 12(10) provides that should the Government decide to remove a commissioner following the issuance of a notice, the Government must lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the decision and the reasons for it. Amendment No. 43 would require the Government to also provide the relevant Oireachtas committee with a statement. Given section 12(10) already provides that a statement should be laid before the Oireachtas, I am advised that this would fundamentally be a duplicate provision and I do not propose to accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the intentions that underpin amendments Nos. 44 and 52, which would have the effect of allowing a commissioner or member of staff of an coimisiún to also hold office as a member of local authority. As general principle, I do not wish to put any obstacles in the path of those who are seeking election to local authorities. As a former councillor - I served with Senator Ward, as he mentioned - I know the important work undertaken by local authorities and the vital role councillors play in holding local authority executives to account and in making and influencing policy, particularly planning policy. However, it is a long-standing principle that holders of positions in the civil and public service are prohibited from taking up political appointments. This is the consistent approach taken across legislation underpinning regulatory bodies, such as the Data Protection Commission, ComReg, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. The purpose of the prohibition on local authority membership is to ensure that a commissioner does not do anything that could give rise even to a perception that his or her official actions are in any way influenced, or are capable of being influenced, by political or party-political motives. This is particularly important in the context of the role of the Coimisiún na Meán, as the independent regulator of the media. I am conscious of the requirements of Article 30 of the audiovisual media service directive, which provides that member states shall ensure that national regulatory authorities are legally distinct from the government and are functionally independent of the respective government and any other public or private bodies. The European Commission will, therefore, closely observe the transposition of the directive. In any case, I would not wish to do anything that would not be in compliance with the directive. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, I understand the intentions underpinning amendments Nos. 44 and 52 but, as I said, in light of the role of Coimisiún na Meán as the independent regulator of the media and in relation to the requirements of Article 30 audiovisual media service directive, I will not accept this amendment. Holding political office is different from other political conflicts. It is not just a matter of stepping outside the room. It would be seen as party political. Staff will also play important roles in investigations. I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators for their amendments but I do not propose to accept them.As regards amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48, section 12(13) of the Broadcasting 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, sets out what constitutes a relevant interest for the purpose of determining whether a commissioner should cease to hold office by virtue of him or her, or a connected person, which includes a family member, holding a relevant interest in a provider of communications media. Section 12(11)(i) provides that a person shall cease to hold office as commissioner if he or she acquires a relevant interest in a provider of communications media. The term "provider of communications media", as set out in section 3(2)(s) of the Bill, is a broad one. It includes not only those services that will be subject to regulation by the coimisiún but also newspapers or periodicals consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs. A person is considered to have a relevant interest if he or she, or a connected person, holds equity with a value greater than €5,000 or debt with a value greater than €13,000 in a provider of communications media. The person may also hold a relevant interest if he or she receives gifts or benefits with a value greater than €650 from the provider or hold a directorship or shadow directorship in a provider. A relevant interest may arise if a person or connected relative is party to an arrangement regarding land with the provider. The values for the maximum debt and equity that may be held and the benefit that may be received were arrived at in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I believe the balance we have arrived at is correct. It fulfils the public policy purpose of ensuring a commissioner does not inadvertently cause a cessation of office by virtue of him or her, or a connected person, acquiring a small interest or deriving a small benefit while also protecting against any conflict of interest that may arise. I understand the intention of amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48 in seeking to go even further than the Bill in addressing conflicts of interest. The thresholds also apply to connected persons, including family. However, the proposed amendments could have unintended effects. In particular, prohibiting the holding of debt or equity in providers of communications media by connected relatives could cause commissioners to cease office if a family member acquired any debt or equity whatsoever in a provider of communications media. In this regard, I am thinking of pension products that involve investments in passive or active pension funds, which may give rise to small debt or equity holdings in respect of providers of communications media. This may be wholly outside the control of the connected relative but would nonetheless require the commissioner to cease office if these amendments were accepted. As I have said, I believe we have the balance right in the Bill in tackling any conflict of interest that may arise, while also recognising that small interests in providers of communications media may be held. I understand the intention behind amendment No. 49 in seeking to broaden the definition of "relevant interest" to encompass social media accounts. However, regarding the core principle of ensuring commissioners or connected persons do not derive benefits from the providers of communications media, I believe section 12(13)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, achieves this by limiting the value of any benefits that may be received by a commissioner, connected person or staff member of the coimisiún from a provider of communications media to €650. This would also apply to income derived from the monetisation of a social media account, for example. Although the Senator said amendment No. 49 was really raised for debate, I worry it could give rise to unintended consequences whereby a commissioner could be removed from office through no fault of his or her own as a result of this provision. For example, an ill-intentioned person or entity could purchase a large quantity of fake followers in respect of a commissioner or connected person with the intention of causing a commissioner to exceed the threshold of 20,000 followers. Regarding amendment No. 49, as we discussed regarding amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 41, the Bill will be amended to provide for an online safety commissioner who will be appointed to oversee the making of online safety codes and applying them to designated online services. I am conscious that this will be a demanding role and one that is likely to be controversial. I am worried that the amendment would pose a particular risk for the online safety commissioner given the role at the forefront of regulating designated online services. Amendment No. 50, which I will not be accepting, has the same effect as amendments Nos. 44 and 52, which we have discussed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Under section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, the coimisiún may establish advisory committees to assist and advise it in matters relating to its functions. Amendment No. 53 would have the effect of requiring that members of any advisory committee of the coimisiún be subject to the same requirements to disclose interests under section 37 of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, as a commissioner, member of staff at the commission, consultant or adviser. This is a broad obligation that requires the person in question to disclose interests relating to any organisation that may derive a benefit from any matter being considered by the coimisiún and to recuse himself or herself from any discussions or decisions regarding the matter in question. This is a proportionate obligation for a commissioner, member of staff of the commission or consultant or adviser, but it may not be so for members of advisory committees. Advisory committees may be established by the coimisiún for many purposes, and the membership of such committees may comprise experts, industry representatives or representatives of particular groups, such as children, persons with disabilities and racialised communities. One of the purposes for which a committee may be established would be to provide advice to the coimisiún on its regulatory functions, though I would not wish to prejudge how many or what types of committees may be established. An example could be a committee set up to advise the coimisiún on regulatory matters relating to sound broadcasting services. In that case, it would be appropriate to include representatives of the regulated entities, such as the public service broadcasters and independent radio sector. Similarly, the coimisiún could set up a committee comprising representatives of organisations promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. Amendment No. 53 would have the effect of precluding these representatives from effectively participating in such advisory committees that the coimisiún may establish as those representatives would have an interest within the meaning of section 37 in the outcome of any discussions at the meetings of those committees and any advice they may provide to the coimisiún. Given the above, I propose to reject the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Section 32 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may enter into co-operation agreements with a body established in the State. As I said when speaking to amendment No. 26, this section will enable an coimisiún to engage with a range of body within the State if it will assist an coimisiún to discharge its functions. The section also provides that an coimisiún may co-operate with bodies outside of the State if they are to provide similar function an coimisiún, as section 32(3) indicates. This may, in particular, include members of the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, ERGA. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has been an active member of the European regulators group and I expect an coimisiún will maintain this strong tradition by co-operating and working with other European national regulatory authorities. Amendment No. 74 would amend section 32 4) to require that where the commission enters into an agreement to co-operate with a body, it should provide not only the Minister, as provided for in the Bill, but also the relevant Oireachtas joint committee with a copy of the agreement.  I thank the Senator for her amendment and I am absolutely in favour of the oversight of public bodies by the Oireachtas. That is why section 28 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, contains strong provisions requiring the chairperson and individual commissioners to appear before an Oireachtas committee to give account of the performance of their functions. I cannot accept the amendment as drafted because reference cannot be made to specific Oireachtas committees in legislation in the manner in the amendment. However, I will reflect on the amendment with a view to further consideration in the context of Report Stage. In doing so, I will consider the appropriate balance to be struck between parliamentary oversight and any provisions that may impinge on the independence of an coimisiún, which is provided for in section 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendments and acknowledge her expertise in the area of data protection. Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, is intended to specify the circumstances under which, and the bodies to which, the commission may disclose personal data. I believe that the intention of amendment No. 75 has been captured in section 33(2) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill. Throughout section 33(2) it is specified that the commission shall only disclose personal data where it considers that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes set out in its various paragraphs so, therefore, I do not accept the amendment. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive. Amendments No. 76 and 78 have the collective effect of preventing the commission from disclosing personal data to a broadcaster or a video on-demand service in respect of a complaint made against those services. I believe that would impact the functioning of the complaints mechanism set out in section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 11 of the Bill, which enables people to complain to the commission regarding a failure by services to comply with media service rules and codes. The complaints system is an important mechanism that has been operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and is applicable to broadcasters under the extent of the Broadcasting Act 2009. It has been extended to video on-demand services by the Bill. It is underpinned by the requirement that a broadcaster or a provider of a video on-demand service prepares and implements a code of practice for the handling of complaints, which is a requirement of section 47 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 10 of the Bill. Section 48(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 11 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may refer a complaint to the broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service in the first instance. This is a continuation of the existing provision applying to the complaints system operated by the BAI. It ensures that the broadcaster or video on-demand service should attempt to address a complaint, in the first instance, in accordance with its codes of practice for the handling of complaints. It is often not immediately clear to people unfamiliar with the complaints system operated by the BAI to whom a complaint should first be made and about what matters. This provision also ensures that an coimisiún, when it is established and comes to expand the BAI system to video on-demand services, can transfer a complaint to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service where those service providers are best placed to respond. If the complaint is not dealt with to the complainant's satisfaction then it can then be dealt with by an coimisiún. Amendment No. 77 would prevent the prescription of further bodies to whom the commission could disclose personal data. I believe that it is important that the Bill is future-proofed such that, and only after careful consideration in accordance with section 33(4), a Minister may prescribe further bodies as necessary. Amendment No. 79 would require an coimisiún to make best efforts to contact and seek the consent of a complainant prior to transferring a complaint to a broadcaster or a provider of a video on-demand service. I do not propose to accept this amendment for a number of reasons. The first reason is that the legal basis for data processing, relied upon by this section, is not consent but that the "processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller". This has been set down in the Article 6(e) of the general data protection regulation, which obliges member states when using this legal basis to set down the purpose of that processing in national law.This is what the section does with regard to the processing of personal data for the purpose of transferring complaints. The public policy rationale for using the public interest legal basis rather than the legal basis of consent was that requiring complainants to resubmit their complaints to the appropriate body is burdensome and especially onerous for vulnerable complainants. In this regard, I am conscious of the work of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism. This section may need to be relied upon to transfer online safety complaints between public bodies if the group recommends to me, and I accept, the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. If there is concern about a lack of communication with complainants I think amendment No. 80 may address it. I will come back to this shortly. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 79. Amendment No. 81, which would require a data protection impact assessment to be undertaken prior to any such prescription, might be an important safeguard. For this reason I propose to return to further consider this on Report Stage if the Senator agrees. In a similar vein, amendment No. 80 could provide another important further safeguard in legislation. It provides that where disclosure of personal data is made by the commission to be broadcast on video-on-demand service or to a body prescribed by the Minister, all reasonable efforts shall be taken to inform the complainant of this disclosure. While I propose to reject the amendment now, I will consider it further and return to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I have outlined, I am willing to come back on Report Stage with regard to amendments Nos. 80 and 81. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 75 to 79, inclusive. With regard to the expert group, I hope to receive the report in the next week. I will then need to consider it. If we go by the amount of time the group was given to do its work, then its report is due shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for amendments Nos. 82 and 83. The amendments appear to have the same effect in preventing the commission from co-operating with groups in the establishments of standards or self-regulatory systems. I wish to point out that it will always remain open for people to complain to the commission under the relevant media service codes and rules. Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amendment by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the audiovisual media services directive and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms. Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments that would appear to contradict the directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The commission will have a strong role in regulating commercial communications, including advertisement, through the media service codes which will be binding on video-on-demand services and broadcasting services and through online safety codes which will be binding on designated online services. As I said, I cannot accept these amendments that would appear to contradict the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. That directive also requires member states to foster self-regulation. This section also covers, apart from advertisement, for example, co-operation with the Press Council. I cannot foresee any language there because I cannot contradict the directive. I am not accepting these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In the context of amendment No. 84, I would be concerned that as it is drafted it would have the unintended consequence of preventing an employee of an coimisiún from seeking to influence any considerations of an coimisiún regarding the contract of that employee. This would seem to prevent employees from representing their interests to their employer, namely, an coimisiún. The provision in the Bill, as currently drafted, was designed to prevent such scenarios from occurring. Accordingly I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 37 (2)(a) and (2)(b), which the Senator is seeking to delete, are about a person’s contract with an coimisiún; they are not about the requirements of disclosure regarding a person’s activities in terms of an employment contract. It is about a person’s contract; it is not about the requirements for disclosure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, they have a duty in the context of disclosure. This section is about a person's contract.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for bringing forward this amendment, which would have the effect of obliging all public bodies engaged in the distribution of State monies for the production, screening and broadcasting of audiovisual or sound content to ensure that funds are distributed equitably and proportionately throughout the whole island of Ireland, with particular regard to the need for regional balance in investment and representation in audiovisual, screen and sound content. For a number of reasons, I will not be accepting it. At its widest, and taking the specific bodies referenced in the amendment, a definition of "public bodies" could cover the Revenue Commissioners, in its role regarding the application of section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland, in regard to making development and production loans available, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, in the context of the Sound & Vision scheme, TG4, regarding its role in commissioning content, and RTÉ, in terms of funding for independent production through the independent production account established under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act. Each of the funds disbursed by those bodies may come from two sources. The first is the Exchequer, in the form of funding from section 481, Screen Ireland loans and TG4. The second is from the licence fee, in the form of funding from RTÉ, and the Sound & Vision scheme. While I appreciate the intent in regard to ensuring more balanced regional development and representation, the amendment contains a number of fundamental elements that would render it unworkable due to the nature of the audiovisual sector in the State and potential issues relating to EU Law. In the case of TG4, for example, as a publisher broadcaster, it commissions all of its content production from Gaeltacht-based companies, largely in Galway but also in Cork and Waterford. Obliging TG4 to distribute funding equitably and proportionately throughout the whole island of Ireland could undermine its current commissioning model and the range of independent production companies that support this. It is natural that production companies providing for TG4 would be concentrated in Gaeltacht areas because more fluent Irish speakers live there. I would be worried about the unintended consequences for TG4 if we are providing that funding should be spread evenly. This amendment would also impact on the operation of the section 481 film tax credit. The relief is distributed by the Revenue Commissioners and is technically open to any EU-based company that meets the qualifying criteria. As a result, restricting the application of this relief to the island of Ireland, as suggested in the amendment, would actually appear to be a contravention of EU law. I agree that seeking balanced regional development is important, and it is an objective of the Government. That is the objective behind the national planning framework, and it underpins the national development plan. However, I do not think it is appropriate to place such an objective in legislation as proposed by the Senators. The amendment actually appears to be contrary to EU law and could give rise to a number of unintended consequences.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I appreciate the intent but I just cannot accept the amendment as drafted because there are a few fundamental issues with it.If the Senator wants to have a discussion with my officials about what he is trying to achieve, that could be done because there are a number of complex issues - even about the role of the commission in this and what the Senator is trying to achieve. I am happy to ask my officials to engage with the Senator. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, I understand the intention behind this amendment and take the point that it can be very troubling for people living on the island of Ireland, be they Irish citizens or not, to watch their public service broadcasters and seeing their part of the island of Ireland effectively blacked out or removed. However, I would be concerned about accepting an amendment that would be so prescriptive as to what RTÉ and TG4 could or could not display. Under section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence as regards programming content. The purpose of this independence is to prevent political interference in the operation of RTÉ and TG4. Prescribing the format or content of any programming in such a detailed manner, including how data is presented, no matter how well-intentioned, would run contrary to the principle of editorial independence and I do not think it is appropriate for us as legislators to determine the type of content that should be displayed so specifically. While this amendment is clearly seeking to prevent the recurrence of something that offended and hurt many people, it could set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation. As that is something we should seek to avoid in principle, I cannot accept the amendment. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 46A(6) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by section 8, requires an coimisiún to publish the register of video-on-demand services established in Ireland on its own website. Amendment No. 90 would require the commission to furnish a copy of this register to the relevant Oireachtas committee annually. I am not sure I see the value in this amendment, given that the register will be made publicly available by the commission under section 46A(6) and through the European Commission under Article 2.5b of the audiovisual media service directive. I propose to reject the amendment as it would appear to require the provision of information that will actually be in the public domain.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendment. The figure of €2 million is derived from the definition of a media business set out in Part 3A of the Competition Act 2002, as amended, which provides for the media mergers framework. For reasons of consistency and proportionality, I believe that we should continue to use this figure and cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The media in different jurisdictions may be different. Section 46I of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as inserted by section 9 of the Bill provides for a definition of "relevant media service provider". This is important as some of the duties and aspects of the media service code set out in section 9 of the Bill, such as those related to objectivity and impartiality, apply to this category of provider rather than to all providers of audiovisual on-demand media services. I believe consistency is important in these matters, as is alignment between the Bill and the media mergers framework.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 would have the effect of changing a requirement for broadcast and video on-demand services not to broadcast or make available, "anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence", to a requirement not to broadcast or make available"anything that may reasonably be regarded as causing harm to a group of persons, or a member of a group, based on any of the grounds referred to in Article 21 of the Charter [of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]". In terms of the reference to the charter in amendment No. 93, I note that section 46J(1)(d) which this amendment seeks to amend as section 46J(1)(a) already requires that service providers not broadcast or make available "anything which may reasonably be regarded as likely to incite to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons, or a member of a group, based on any of the grounds referred to in Article 21 of the Charter". This reference is to give effect to Article 6 of the revised audiovisual and media services directive. Going further than the directive in reference to the charter, without a firm basis in existing EU legislation, may give rise to unintended consequences. Given one of the grounds in Article 21 of the charter is a, "political or ... other opinion", the amendment may inadvertently prevent criticism of political groups. Accordingly, I propose to reject the amendment. In terms of the outright deletion proposed by amendment No. 92, I cannot accept this for two reasons. One of the reasons is that this requirement, in part, transposes the requirement in the revised audiovisual and media services directive for member states to ensure that media service providers do not make available programmes which may impair the mental, moral or physical development of children. The second reason is that I believe it is correct that media service providers are held to a high standard in terms of the programmes they, as editorial services, make available to the general public and as such, this provision has value and serves the public good.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is the value of debate in the House. I can see the point the Senator is raising. While the Senator's definition is too wide, I can see the issues she is raising and recognise there is an issue in the language. I propose not to accept amendment No. 93 but to ask my officials to look at the language of what is there, given the concerns that have been flagged in the House today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendment and contribution. She knows the exact background to this in respect of amendments Nos. 94 and 95. I agree on first examination that some of the wording in the Bill does look old-fashioned, particularly the language in section 46J(1) which requires: “A broadcaster [or] an audiovisual on-demand media service [not to broadcast or] make available … anything which may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine the authority of the State". As the Senator has correctly pointed out, that language has been carried over from existing provisions set out in section 39(1)(d) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009 which, in turn, reflects previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution, which sets out that:The State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.I would note that while the understanding of the country of the meaning of this article has definitely changed over time, it does contain and imply a number of fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, while acknowledging that such rights may be limited in the public interest. This notion of fundamental rights needs to be balanced, depending on the facts on the ground, and that they are not absolute is something that we can all agree on. This article requires the State to limit freedom of expression in certain instances and the courts have since set a high bar as to when it is appropriate for the State to do so. It is right that this language and associated jurisprudence is carried forward through the Bill. As such, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 94 and 95 but I understand the Senator’s position.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did say the court has set that high bar. This is a tried and tested provision which reflects the safeguards contained in the Constitution. It has been operated in a balanced way in the years since it has been on the Statute Book. As a result, I will not be accepting amendments No. 94 and 95.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The ability of the media to freely and independently express opinion is both a core value and a cornerstone of democracy. Without free and independent media, a well-informed citizenry cannot exist and democracy cannot function in any meaningful sense of the word. That is what the Constitution provides for and what this Bill reflects. Within that framework, investigative journalism plays an important role. I absolutely understand the intention behind amendment No. 97, which seeks to mitigate a perceived risk that the Bill, as initiated, would undermine the ability of media service providers to carry news and current affairs content which is critical of the Government or public officials or would have an adverse effect on investigative journalism. I do not think, however, that section 46(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, needs to be qualified in the manner suggested by the amendment. The language used in the section reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act, which has not to date exercised a chilling effect on broadcast journalism. For the same reason, I do not accept amendment No. 97.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The functions of the commission safeguard liberty of expression and explicitly safeguard the democratic values in the Constitution. The text that is proposed to be deleted and-or replaced has been carried forward from the Broadcasting Act 2009. It has been on the Statute Book for more than a decade. To date, we are not aware of any adverse impact on public discourse or investigative journalism from those provisions. As a result, I will not accept amendment No. 97.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As Senators will be aware, an coimisiún will be responsible for issuing permanent and temporary sound broadcasting contracts following enactment of the Bill and dissolution of the BAI. The amendment requires an coimisiún to receive the approval of an Oireachtas joint committee before authorising a derogation from the requirement that a sound broadcasting service shall devote not less than 20% of the broadcasting time on the service to news and current affairs programmes. Granting such derogations is a matter that should be left to the commission to undertake as an independent regulatory authority and I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment. The BAI currently grants such derogations.I remind Senators that licences are for a finite period. It is a key principle that an coimisiún should be able to make regulatory decisions free from external interference, particularly from political bodies, as is required by the audiovisual media services directive. Requiring specific approval, as the Senator referred to in her question on the political side, by an Oireachtas committee may represent undue interference in the regulatory independence of an coimisiún, which would be likely to approve a number of temporary sound broadcasting contracts throughout the year, such as that for Christmas FM. There is also the practical consideration that Oireachtas committees fall on the dissolution of the Dáil and would therefore not be available to approve a derogation at certain stages. Consider how long it took the past two Governments to form. The committees were gone for some time. That could be an issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Acting Chairperson. I am not accepting the amendment for two reasons. There is the political interference and difficulties with the Oireachtas committee, which Senator Higgins accepted, but also the fact that the BAI already grants such derogations. That will be carried over by an coimisiún and licences are for a finite period, which has not caused an issue to this point.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the intent of amendments Nos. 102, 106, 127 and 148. I agree with the Senators that gambling addiction poses a major challenge to our society, particularly when it involves children and young people. This is why the establishment of a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being with the powers to regulate advertising gambling websites and apps was a commitment in the programme for Government. The Minister for Justice published the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill last October. That Bill will establish a new regulatory authority, namely, the gambling authority of Ireland. Specifically, head 109 of the general scheme sets out that the authority shall make codes concerning the advertising of gambling. These codes may include restrictions or prohibitions concerning such matters as the times of day that gambling may be advertised on broadcasters, video on demand and audiostreaming services; an option for a customer of a video on-demand service to opt out of receiving advertising and a requirement that a video-sharing platform service should not display gambling by default but should require an opt-in mechanism. The general scheme also requires the gambling regulator to engage with an coimisiún on such codes to facilitate joined-up thinking on the regulation of advertising.Given that the Gambling Authority of Ireland will issue codes in respect of advertising, I do not propose to accept these amendments. It would not be an effective use of resources or coherent policy to mandate two regulatory authorities to regulate the same matter. Senators have spoken about this. Given its remit, role and specialisation, the Gambling Authority of Ireland will be the best place to regulate the advertising of gambling. As regards speculative financial activities, the Central Bank of Ireland regulates the advertising of financial activities by financial services firms under its remit. The rules are set out in the consumer protection code published by the Central Bank. To make a general point, I recognise that crypto-assets pose a significant challenge for consumer protection. In that regard, I note the EU markets in crypto-assets regulation is currently under negotiation in Brussels. It will set out a licensing regime for crypto-assets. However, fundamentally, it will be for authorities other than an coimisiún with specific expertise to set out the primary rules for regulating the advertising of crypto-assets. While I do not accept these amendments, I recognise their intent and the points the Senators have made today. Gambling is a scourge for many families. On the broader issue raised by Senators Cassells and Byrne in amendment No. 28, which relates to the role of an coimisiún regarding gambling addiction, I have committed to speaking to my colleague the Minister for Justice on the matter in advance of returning to that amendment on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their proposed amendments. Amendments Nos. 123 and 125 would specifically insert references to substitutes for breast milk or milk-based formulae into section 46N(5). This would make explicit the power of coimisiún na meán to prohibit commercial communications relating to infant and follow-on formulae in the context of media service codes. I recognise the intention of the amendments and understand the concerns the Senators have regarding the advertisement of infant and follow-on formulae. The public health advice is clear that there is considerable evidence to demonstrate the importance of breastfeeding for the health of both mothers and infants. Data from the World Health Organization indicate that Ireland has lower breastfeeding rates than the global and European average. Members will be aware that the information requirements and advertising standards in respect of infant, meaning a child under 12 months, and follow-on formulae are currently set out in EU regulations. These regulations set out detailed composition and labelling requirements for infant and follow-on formulae intended for use by infants in good health and recognise the importance of the World Health Organization international code of marketing breastmilk substitutes. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for implementing these information requirements, while policy responsibility rests with the Department of Health. Under the extant Broadcasting Act 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has issued the general commercial communications code, which provides that commercial communications for infant and follow-on formulae shall comply with all relevant Irish and European legislation and with rules, regulations and codes of practice issued from time to time by a relevant public health body. This is appropriate, as the BAI ultimately must rely on public health advice issued by the appropriate bodies as regards public health matters. Following the enactment of this Bill, it will be an coimisiún that will be tasked with making media service codes. The general commercial communications code will continue in force until superseded by any code that an coimisiún will make. I can see the merits in setting out explicitly in legislation that an coimisiún may prohibit commercial communications relating to infant or follow-on formulae through media service codes, subject to considering the appropriate health advice on the matter. As the marketing of infant formulae is the policy responsibility of the Minister for Health, I will ask my officials to consult with officials in the Department of Health in the first instance. While I do not accept these amendments today, I will return to the House on Report Stage to set out the next steps. I am not willing to accept amendment No. 103. It would appear to immediately ban the advertisement of breast milk substitutes on broadcasting and certain video on-demand services. As I said, primary policy responsibility lies with the Department of Health and other public health authorities, and rules providing for information and advertising standards are harmonised through the EU regulations. It is best to allow an coimisiún to consult with public health authorities before any decisions are made regarding the prohibition of commercial communications for infant or follow-on formulae. This both respects the regulatory independence of an coimisiún and allows for the advice of public health authorities to be considered. Amendment No. 124 would make explicit the power of an coimisiún to prohibit commercial communications relating to alcohol through a media service code. The advertisement of alcohol has primarily been addressed through the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, which contains strong measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising. Sections 15 and 16 of the Act, which are in operation since November 2021, restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship promoting alcohol products and include a ban on alcohol advertising and sponsorship at events aimed particularly at children or at which the majority of participants or competitors are children. These measures help to ensure that children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol products and alcohol advertising. Section 19 of the Act provides for a broadcast watershed on radio and television stations. Prohibiting alcohol advertising during times when children might be in the audience will reduce children's exposure to such advertisements. The Department of Health is working with my Department, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the environmental health service of the HSE with regard to the commencement of this provision. Policy responsibility for alcohol advertising rests with the Minister for Health within the framework of the public health legislation on this issue. The Public Health (Alcohol) Act contains a suite of measures specifically designed to protect children from exposure to alcohol advertisements. I am committed to engaging with the Minister for Health and his Department to facilitate the early commencement of the remaining sections of the Act. I expect that any media service codes issued by an coimisiún will set out the requirement on broadcasters and video on-demand services providers to fully comply with the Public Health (Alcohol) Act. This Bill already provides an coimisiún with sufficient power to do so, and I do not propose to accept the amendment. Regarding amendments Nos. 120 and 128, as a matter of principle I cannot accept amendments which would unduly limit the discretion of an coimisiún in the creation of regulatory codes. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for the points they have made. As set out in the Bill, I would expect that an coimisiún will have a strong role to play in providing for standards and practices to ensure that commercial communications protect the interests of the audience and, in particular, the interests of children. An coimisiún will do so through the making of binding media service codes. The existing general commercial communications code which applies to broadcasters will remain in force until amended or revoked by an coimisiún. In making media service codes related to commercial communications, it is important that an coimisiún takes advice from other public bodies with the appropriate expertise. In the case of infant and follow-on formula and alcohol, the appropriate experts would be relevant public health authorities. It is important that we do not through this Bill inadvertently introduce overlapping functions on the regulation of advertising, for example, between an coimisiún and public health authorities. I am confident that an coimisiún will take the best advice from the relevant public bodies and reflect them in the media service codes. I understand the intention of Senator Black's amendment on the advertising of alcohol because alcohol abuse inflicts terrible damage on individuals, their families and wider society. That is why the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 is such important legislation. It provides the appropriate base in law to regulate alcohol advertising. However, as I have said, I expect an coimisiún will require in any media service code it makes addressing commercial communications that broadcasters and video on-demand services online will fully comply with the Act and any other public health provisions that may be advised by the Department of Health.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Leader for requesting this opportunity. As she said, amendment No. 106 was not discussed in the Chamber. This amendment raises an important issue. Conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice and the programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to ban that therapy. My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has been leading on this issue. My intention was to reject the amendment today but consider the matter before Report Stage. I intend to speak to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in advance of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not intend to accept any of these amendments. Amendment No. 110 provides that the media service codes made under section 46N shall be subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media. I cannot accept this amendment because it would represent undue interference in the regulatory independence of the commission. It is a key principle that the commission should be able to make regulatory decisions free from external interference, particularly from political bodies, as is required by the audiovisual media services directive. By compelling an coimisiún to make media service codes covering all matters within section 46N(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, amendments Nos 109 and 111 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisiún in when and how it exercises regulatory duties through the creation of media service codes.The purpose of establishing an independent regulatory body, an coimisiún, under this Bill is to delegate the exercise of powers from the Oireachtas to that body, in accordance with Article 15.2.2° of the Constitution. That a body delegated such powers has discretion in the exercise of such powers within the strictures of legislation is appropriate and in the spirit of the provisions on the independence of regulatory bodies in the revised audiovisual media services directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I still do not intend to accept the amendments. I am advised that amendments Nos. 109 and 111 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of the coimisiún in how and when it exercises its regulatory duties through the creation of media service codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for bringing this amendment forward. I very much welcome the intent behind it. The amendment sets out that an coimisiún may, through media service codes, set air play quotas in relation to music content composed or performed by women or persons living on the island of Ireland. In this regard, I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music on our broadcasting services, and in particular the promotion of Irish music composed or performed by women. Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world, and I am keen to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to further nurture and protect this sector. I recently announced an additional allocation of €10.5 million to the sound and vision scheme. That included €2 million to support live music projects. I have asked the BAI to ensure that the application criteria seek to ensure that 50% of both the performers and the creative team involved in these projects should be women. I have also asked that a similar requirement would be included in another forthcoming round of the scheme, which will provide €2 million for Irish language broadcasting projects. This will add to the BAI's existing strategy of ensuring funding decisions have regard to increasing diversity in programme content, including gender equality and inclusion, as well as the extent to which the creative team includes women in a leadership role. Moving from using supports to promote balance in programming to using legislative instruments presents challenges, in particular when airplay quotas are involved. I am conscious of the legal factors which must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing any kind of airplay quotas. Ultimately, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with European Union law, in particular those provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services. I am advised that any quotas in respect of airplay imposed on the basis of nationality or residence would be considered to restrict the free movement of services by placing music that is performed by persons of a particular nationality or living in a particular member state in a more advantaged position. Airplay quotas on the basis of gender might be permissible under EU law if it could be demonstrated that such quotas could be justified by overriding reasons in the general interest. The question is whether setting binding gender quotas in legislation would have the desired effect. If airplay quotas based on gender are permissible under EU law, I would be open to further exploring this issue. However, all of us would want to be certain that any legislation would have its intended effect. The amendment also provides that an coimisiún may make media service codes in relation to broadcasters to provide for the appropriate representation of all groups within the community, on broadcast programme material and on equal representation on broadcast news and current affairs programmes. I am absolutely committed to supporting diversity, inclusion and the full and effective participation of women across the sectors for which my Department is responsible and across wider society. The question is whether media service codes, which are binding on broadcasters, are an appropriate mechanism to achieve this objective. While I do not propose to accept the amendment today, given the importance of the issue raised, I will ask my officials to consider it further with a view to resuming the discussion on this matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is why I am taking the time with the officials to see what can be done. As I outlined in my response, we want to make sure if we bring anything forward that it does not have unnecessary implications and that what it is intended to do would happen. We need time to consider it and then we will come back to the House on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, I was addressing amendment No. 112. Senator Warfield's amendment was ruled out of order, which was nothing to do with either me or my officials. It is the Bills Office that ruled it out of order. In my reply, I was addressing amendment No. 112. Everything I do is in good faith. We want to be certain that any legislation would have its intended effect, so we are taking the time to examine this issue. I thank Senator Higgins for raising it. It is something that I agree is of the utmost importance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 114 would remove the requirement for media service codes to provide for standards and practice to ensure that audiences are protected from anything harmful or offensive. I cannot accept this amendment as I am of the view that the principles and policies set out in section 46N must reflect the need to protect audiences from harmful or offensive content being broadcast. This is, in part, due to the requirement in the revised directive that member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that audiovisual media services which may impair or harm the physical, mental or moral development of children are only made available in such a way as to ensure that children will not normally hear or see them. I understand the point the Senator is making. That is why I am examining this issue more generally in the context of amendments Nos. 92 and 93. They concern a proposal by the Senator to amend similar wording regarding the duties of broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services. My examination of amendments Nos. 92 and 93 will address her concerns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 115 would delete lines 16 and 17 which read with "due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience" and substitute it with the phrase "due sensitivity to the subject matter and the audience". It is noted that the text that is proposed to be deleted and-or replaced reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act which has not, to date, been flagged as an issue in any public or stakeholder consultations carried out by my officials. In my view, the proposed wording seems to broadly achieve the same effect as the original wording and, therefore, I propose to reject the amendment on that basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Similar language is in the Broadcasting Act but to date that has not been flagged in any engagement my officials have had with the public or stakeholders. In regard to the text of the amendment, the subject matter at hand in this provision is set out in section 46N(2)(c) which states "that in programme material audiences are protected from anything harmful or offensive, and in particular that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented ... with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience". I do not believe that a further reference to subject matter is necessary. Furthermore, I do not believe that the proposed changes from referencing the media service providers having "due sensitivity to the convictions and feelings of the audience" to just having "due sensitivity to the audience" would change much as what would having "due sensitivity to the audience" mean in practice other than considering their convictions and feelings? I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Higgins for raising her concerns in amendments Nos. 116, 117, 142 and 143 regarding the terminology used in the Bill. The term “physical, mental and moral development” is a transposition of the text of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive - for example, in Articles 6(B), 9, and 28(B). The use of that terminology is required to properly transpose the directive and therefore I cannot accept these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator. It is not the intention of the section, as drafted, to preclude the provision of programme material related to sexual conduct for educational purposes, particularly on important topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships. Instead the provision intends to protect audiences, and children in particular, from sexual content that may be considered offensive or harmful to their well-being. I can certainly see the merit in the proposed clarification and I have asked my officials to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to returning to the House on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for tabling these amendments. Amendment No. 129 sets out several matters to which an coimisiún should have regard when making media service codes, while amendment No. 130 sets out that an coimisiún should have regard to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 when making media service codes. The objective of media service codes is to provide for standards and practices that are binding on broadcasting and video-on-demand services. The Bill ensures that such standards and practices apply to commercial communications, including advertising, programming and the coverage of news and current affairs.It is important that any standards and practices set out are not overly prescriptive, to the point that they are perceived to direct what types of content should be covered or to impinge on editorial independence. I cannot accept the amendments, as they may contain the implication that media service codes may direct broadcasters or video on-demand services to prioritise particular types of content. However, I understand the intention of the Senator's amendment in seeking to draw attention to the matters set out in the amendments. A more appropriate place for some of those provisions would be section 7, which provides for powers, functions and duties of an coimisiún. Many of the subjects set out in the non-exhaustive list suggested in amendment No. 129 are adequately captured in section 7 in a way that ensures they inform the totality of the work of an coimisiún. For example, section 7(3)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, provides that an coimisiún shall promote and stimulate the development of programmes in the Irish language and programmes relating to climate change and sustainability. Section 7(4) provides that an coimisiún shall have regard to the policies of the Government in respect of climate change and sustainability. As regards the reference to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, IHREC, 2014, in amendments Nos. 129 and 130, as I outlined previously in the debate, section 42 of the IHREC Act provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún will be subject to the provisions of that Act. I agree with the Senator's point that public bodies should comply with section 42 of the IHREC Act as a matter of course. I would expect that an coimisiún would not only simply comply with the Act but, as a public body, would show a culture of respect for human rights. As regards references to international legal instruments such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I would expect that an coimisiún will, as a public body, have regard not only to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but all international conventions, which have been ratified and entered into force here. I am not sure of the rationale for listing some international legal instruments and not others. Amendment No. 132 requires that an coimisiún should have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 when making media service rules. It is important that in making media service rules, the legislation is sufficiently precise as to the nature and content of the rules. The points I have made regarding amendments No. 129 and 130 would apply to this amendment. The requirement to have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act is too broad for this provision and therefore I cannot accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 133 and 134 would have the effect of obliging the commission to prepare a report on the operation of the media service rules made under section 46O(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, on an annual basis. The requirement for review every three years, as proposed in the Bill, gives effect to Article 7.2 of the audiovisual media services directive. As the current timelines in the Bill reflect the requirements of the directive, I will not be accepting this amendment. Amendment No. 135 would have the effect of specifying that an coimisiún should make a draft media code or rule available both online and in a public place. I do not agree with inserting the proposed level of detail into the Bill and, accordingly, do not propose to accept the amendment. Amendments Nos. 136 and 137 both require that the period in which a person may make a submission to an coimisiún regarding a draft media service code or rule shall be a minimum of 30 days. The Bill, as initiated, provides that the period shall be as specified by an coimisiún. I do not think that circumstances would arise where an coimisiún would run a public consultation process with a very constrained time period for responses. Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 138 requires that a notice issued by an coimisiún setting out that availability of a draft media service code or rule for inspection and public consultation period shall be published at least four weeks prior to the public consultation period commencing. I do not see the merit in providing for a period of four weeks in legislation. It would be more usual for a public body to give notice that a public consultation was commencing, rather than that a public consultation would commence in a specified period. Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appreciate that the Senator sees the issue in terms of what is set out in the audiovisual media services directive. As regards the other amendments, as I stated, they are unnecessarily over-prescriptive for legislation and I will not, therefore, be accepting them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the three points, we have debated the first two in the last brief. The third point is an issue for the Bills Office, because I do not have any say over what is ruled out of order.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 11 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, primarily to extend the complaints process to video on-demand services. It is important that the complaints system operated by an coimisiún contains some provision to limit the time period to which complaints relate in order that an coimisiún is not receiving complaints relating to broadcasts that took place years prior to the complaints. That is why section 11 of the Bill maintains the existing provision in section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 that a complaint must be made not more than 30 days after a broadcast in the first instance. I cannot accept amendment No. 140, as it would have the effect of enabling a complainant to complain about a broadcast for months or even years in the past, as long as the complainant groups the complaint with a complaint about a more recent broadcast. Addressing historical complaints about broadcasts from years gone by would not be the most effective use of the complaints procedure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, amendment No. 140 would open up the complaints process to complaints relating to any broadcast made in the State as long as the complainant could group his or her complaint with a complaint made not more than 30 days after a separate broadcast. That is too wide and would just not be an effective use of the complaints procedure. I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Similar to Senator Carrigy, I can see the merit of the amendment. However, I believe that the term “as soon as practicable” should be retained so as to avoid “30 days” becoming a standard time in which a complainant would be notified rather than an absolute limit. Although I do not accept the amendment today, I intend to return to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Ruane for tabling amendments Nos. 145 and 146 regarding the definition of cyberbullying in the Bill. The current definition in section 44, inserting section 139A into the Broadcasting Bill 2009, was arrived at through extensive consultation and engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.It refers to online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person and subjects that definition to a risk test regarding risk to a person's life or risk of significant harm to a person's physical or mental health where the harm is reasonably foreseeable. The proposed amendments would have the effect of replacing the current definition with a narrower definition focused on repeated abusive behaviour and to subject that definition to a reasonable person test. In this regard, I believe that the content intended to be covered by the amendment is covered by the category of offence-specific content which refers in turn to the updated offence of harassment under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, Coco's Law, under section 45 of the Bill inserting Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act. The category of harmful online content regarding cyberbullying is intended to be broader than the matters covered by Coco's Law but subject to the risk test. I do not believe it would be desirable to limit the definition of cyberbullying in this manner and I do not propose to accept the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the Senator's concerns but I believe the provision is sufficiently precise to avoid the issues she raised. It was done with extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. It was considered in-depth during drafting. Therefore, I will not accept the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The effect of amendment No. 147 would be to insert another category of harmful online content regarding disinformation. I do not propose to accept the amendment for a number of reasons. Disinformation and false information intended to mislead is being tackled on an EU-wide basis through a number of mechanisms, including the Digital Services Act, political agreement on which was agreed on Friday, 22 April. The Government has decided that Coimisiún na Meán will be the digital service co-ordinator which is the primary regulator under the Digital Services Act. My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has led Ireland's negotiations on the Digital Services Act.  The EU code of practice on disinformation is a Commission initiative which has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. In addition, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in DCU and which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. While I note the intent of the amendment, the matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the Digital Services Act in Ireland. I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage. Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, Coimisiún na Meán would act as the primary regulator termed the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act. It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and the approaches of Coimisiún na Meán and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. The Digital Services Act is still undergoing negotiation on a number of technical matters. The final text of the regulation is not available. Should the code of practice on disinformation evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act, as proposed by the European Commission, I would expect that Coimisiún na Meán would have a role to play in its capacity as the digital services co-ordinator. There is a very specific problem with disinformation which is designed to influence the results of elections and referendums as these processes are at the heart of our democracy. The Minister for Housing, Local Government, and Heritage asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals for inclusion in the Electoral Reform Bill around the protection of our electoral process against disinformation, with a view to bringing amendments to that Bill which, I understand, is due to commence Committee Stage in the Dáil next week.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the Senator's query, there would be no need to revisit this legislation because the Digital Services Act will provide for it itself.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Ruane for her amendment regarding a role for the Oireachtas joint committee in requesting that an coimisiún consider making a proposal for a new category of harmful online content. As it stands, the Bill provides at section 44 - inserting sections 139B and 139C into the Broadcasting Act 2009 - that it is within an coimisiún's sole discretion as to whether it considers making a proposal to the Minister for a further category of harmful online content. No specific role is provided for the Minister, the Government or indeed the Oireachtas joint committee at that point of the process. The reason for this was to safeguard the independence of an coimisiún, particularly regarding a matter as sensitive as proposals for further categories of harmful online content, and to ensure that the process for making a proposal under these provisions was separated from the political process. In this regard, the directive sets a high bar regarding the independence of regulatory bodies and requires member states to ensure that they are both legally distinct from the government and functionally independent of their respective governments and of any other public or private body. In light of these considerations, I am not proposing to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendment. The amendment would require an coimisiún, when undertaking a public consultation on a proposal for a new category of harmful online content, to publish the draft proposal four weeks before the consultation begins and to require that such a consultation should be at least four weeks. I do not propose to accept the amendment as it appears to be overly prescriptive. In the first instance, it would be more usual for a public body to give notice that a public consultation was commencing, rather than that a public consultation would commence within a specified time. I do not see the value in an coimisiún publishing a draft proposal for a new category of content without at the same time or shortly thereafter commencing its consultation period on the proposal. I also do not foresee circumstances where an coimisiún would seek to artificially foreclose or artificially shorten a public consultation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would provide that where an coimisiún has submitted a proposal for an additional category of harmful online content to the Minister, the Minister may request that an coimisiún reconsider or review the proposal. The relevant section in the Bill as initiated provides that the Minister may request that an coimisiún review the proposal. I do not accept this amendment as I do not see a substantial difference between the meanings of reconsider and review in this context. It is difficult to see how an coimisiún would reconsider a proposal without also reviewing it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators. In terms of amendment No. 164 regarding a minimum age requirement for children, it is important to acknowledge that there is a very real issue with young children accessing online services that simply were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue that I am particularly aware of both as a parent of young children and as chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety. Finding workable solutions in this area raises a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented. In this regard, it is useful to note that an EU-funded pilot called euCONSENT is in development. The pilot aims to deliver a system for online age verification and parental consent, which balances the rights of children and the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content. The outcome of this pilot will inform any approach taken to this issue at an EU and national level. While I cannot accept this amendment, I will be asking an coimisiún to look at this issue as a priority in conjunction with the Data Protection Commission and to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. Not everything can be dealt with in a single item of legislation, but what matters is that we put the framework in place. Regarding amendment No. 163, I note that section 139K of the 2009 Act, as inserted by this Bill, provides coimisiún na meán with the power to create binding safety codes to ensure "that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children". Further to this, section 139K specifically provides that, in respect of providers of video-sharing platform services, that an coimisiún shall make online safety codes requiring those providers to comply with the requirements of Article 9(1) of the revised directive in respect of advertisements directly placed by the provider and user-generated advertisements. This includes a long list of requirements, including regarding the protection of children. As such, given the extensive provision already in the Bill for the regulation of online commercial communication, I will not be accepting this amendment. I understand the intention of amendment No. 165 in seeking to clarify that the definition of age-inappropriate content used in the Bill should not preclude educational material. However, I do not believe that this provision would have this effect due to its framing with regard to the capabilities, development, rights and interests of children. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to amendment No. 163, as I said, there is provision in section 139K of the 2009 Act specifically in respect of providers of video-sharing platform services. We know the coimisiún shall make online safety codes requiring those providers to comply with Article 9(1) of the revised directive, which has an extensive list of requirements, including the protections for children. With regard to amendment No. 164, as I said, it really is a complex issue. I agree with the intent of the Senators' amendment but I do not believe it hits on a workable solution. As I said, there are active moves at the EU to identify practical solutions to these matters. In addition to this, last week, the European Commission proposed a new regulation on combating child sexual abuse. As part of this, the Commission foresees an obligation for certain online services to conduct risk assessments and take risk mitigation measures in respect of age verification. Therefore, work is being done in that regard but I do not think this is a workable solution in this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These amendments would require an coimisiún to have regard to a number of legislative instruments when designating a relevant online service to which online safety codes may be applied. Amendment No. 166 would appear to duplicate provisions already in law and, as such, I do not accept the amendment. As I stated earlier in this debate, section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún will already be subject to provisions of that Act. As I said only yesterday in this Chamber, I would expect that an coimisiún would not only comply with section 42 of that Act but also, in accordance with the spirit of the Act, demonstrate a culture and practice of respect of human rights. With regard to amendment No. 167, I understand the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by the State and entered into force in 2018. Accordingly, similar to other UN conventions that have been ratified and entered into, the State is legally bound to the obligations set out in the treaties. I do not see the rationale for inserting a reference to the UNCRPD in the context of the designation process. The effect of amendment No. 168 would be to require an coimisiún to have regard to the web accessibility directive when considering whether to designate a relevant online service. However, this directive only applies to public bodies and as such, its legal relevance to the designation process would be unclear. As such, I cannot accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 169 would have the effect of requiring coimisiún na meán to deposit a record of consultations undertaken prior to the designation of a relevant online service with the Minister and to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand amendment No. 71 sought to achieve a similar effect. As referenced by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in response to that amendment, it is not usual practice to lay internal records of the processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas, nor for the Oireachtas Library to store such materials. I understand the intention of the amendment is to ensure an coimisiún is transparent in respect of those persons it seeks to consult. However, as a public body, an coimisiún will be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability requirements, including to the joint Oireachtas committee. The principle of transparency is satisfied by the requirement for the commission to be accountable to the Oireachtas. As set out in the Bill, the executive chairperson and the commissioners will be accountable to the joint Oireachtas committee in respect of their functions, while the executive chairperson will additionally be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the finances and value-for-money practices of an coimisiún. The decisions of an coimisiún as regards the making of media service codes, rules and online safety codes are also subject to a clear public consultation process. Furthermore, details of those decisions must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, where they may be subject to a negative resolution procedure. As a regulator, an coimisiún will necessarily be in contact with regulated entities on a regular basis regarding the regulation of those entities. I expect an coimisiún to undertake all such contact appropriately and to be transparent in how it does so. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 170 would require the contact details of the person or persons designated as responsible for online safety at the named service to be entered into the public register of designated online services. Under section 139J of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by this Bill, an coimisiún is required to maintain a register of such services, which shall include the address of the provider and any other information the commission considers appropriate about how the provider may be contacted by members of the public. This provision will achieve a similar effect to the Senator's amendment. Therefore, I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said in relation to the principle of transparency, when it comes to the making of the media service codes and rules and the online safety codes, they are subject to a clear public consultation process and must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so I see that transparency there. The regulator by its very nature must be able to engage on an ongoing basis with the entities it regulates, without an unnecessary or undo administrative burden. There are practical considerations here. We have struck the right balance, so I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In compelling an coimisiún to make online safety codes, amendment No. 171 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisiún in when and how it exercises its regulatory duties through the creation of online safety codes. I refer to our debate yesterday, which was on the similar subject of media service codes. I reiterate that the purpose of establishing the independent regulatory body of an coimisiún under this Bill is to delegate the exercise of powers from the Oireachtas to that body in accordance with Article 15.2.2 of the Constitution. That a body delegated such powers has discretion in the exercise of such powers within the strictures of legislation is appropriate. It is in the spirit of the provisions on the independence of regulatory bodies in the revised audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD. In addition, changing the word “may” to “shall” in those provisions would create a mandatory obligation in every instance which, given the breadth of the provisions, may create a problem. Changing this to a mandatory obligation from a discretionary imperative, which is what the word "may" implies in this context, would mean that an coimisiún could be challenged for not having made a code about any particular issue that is standard or practice of these service providers. Given the breadth of these provisions, this is potentially significantly problematic. If we go down this road, we would likely need to significantly limit the range of matters that may be addressed through online safety codes to a small and exclusive list that would no doubt rapidly become out of date. I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I recognise the objective behind these amendments, which is to specify that an coimisiún may protect the health of children by regulating, through online safety codes, commercial communications relating to certain products, including foods high in fat, sugar, salt, as well as alcohol and gambling products. In this regard, I note that an coimisiún already has this power under the Bill and, in particular, in relation to the regulation of commercial communications on video sharing platform services, which must abide by the provisions set out in Article 9(1) of the revised audiovisual media services directive. However, in taking any action in this area, an coimisiún would be guided by the policies of the Department of Health, which is responsible for public health policy on these matters. I see the merit of specifically referencing the public health interests of children in this section. For this reason, although I am rejecting amendments Nos. 173 to 177, inclusive, I would like to return to them on Report Stage once I have engaged with the Minister for Health. On amendment No. 177, I note the reference to milk-based formula and remind the Senators that I have committed to examining issues as to the advertising of such products in advance of Report Stage. However, on amendments Nos. 175 to 177, inclusive, I note that just referencing programmes would not cover the range of user-generated content available through designated online services nor would it cover those commercial communications placed directly by the service provider. I cannot accept amendment No. 183 as I believe the wording in subsection 1 of the amendment is not specific enough to achieve its intended objective and that the issues regarding the use of personal data of children in subsection 3, while worthy of attention and concern, are a matter for the Data Protection Commission. If a provision in the Data Protection Act has not been commenced, the issue that arises is the commencement of that provision by the Minister for Justice, not repeating those provisions in another Act, one that deals with content regulation and not data protection. As to subsection 2, I am examining this issue in relation to the other amendments in this grouping. In conclusion, I do not accept amendment No. 183, but I will examine the other amendments in this grouping before Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I still believe that we are dealing with different regulators. The use of personal data of children is subsection (3) of the amendment. It is worthy of attention and concern, but it is a matter for the Data Protection Commission. The regulator that we are setting up in this Bill deals with content regulation and not data protection. This is an issue for the Department of Justice and for the Data Protection Commission, so I am not accepting this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I cannot accept this amendment. As I said previously, it would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisiún in when and how it exercises regular duties through the creation of online safety codes. I have explained my reason for not accepting amendments of this kind in previous discussions around amendments grouped with amendments Nos. 133 and 171. I am not proposing to accept this amendment either.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In the first instance, I would suggest that amendments Nos. 179 and 180 would be more appropriate to amending section 139M of the Bill, rather than amending section 139K. Amending section 139M already provides for a range of matters that an coimisiún must have regard to when preparing online safety codes. On the intention behind amendment No. 179 and, in the first instance, the proposed inclusion of section 42 of Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is a matter which must be considered by an coimisiún in the preparation of online safety codes. As I noted before, this would appear to duplicate provisions already in law. Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún would already be subject to the provisions of that Act. Similar to other UN conventions that have been ratified and entered into, the State is legally bound by the obligations set out in the treaties. I do not see the rationale for specifically referencing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in context of making online safety codes. Further to this and regarding the web accessibility directive, as I said, this directive only applies to public bodies and, therefore, its legal relevance to the making of online safety codes is unclear. Therefore, I do not intend to accept amendment No. 179. On amendment No. 180, in the first instance, I note that under the amending section 139(1)(b) that an coimisiún shall consult with any person it thinks appropriate in advance of making an online safety code. While, in practice, this will be a matter for an coimisiún, I would see this as covering the persons referenced in the amendment. In addition, I would see it as inappropriate to single out persons with expertise in a limited field who must be consulted. This may give rise to the impression that the views of those persons should be held in higher regard than those not explicitly referenced. It would also be impractical and quite difficult to provide for an exhaustive list of such persons who must be consulted in advance of making an online safety code. Generally, however, it is the expectation that there will be a strong culture of consultation with relevant persons and stakeholders when it comes to the creation of regulatory codes. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 180.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 183a provides that an coimisiún should have an online safety code requiring that designated online services seek to minimise the risk of harm arising from the spread of disinformation. I do not propose to accept the amendment for a number of reasons.Regarding disinformation, this kind of content is being tackled, as has been acknowledged by the Senator, on an EU-wide basis through a number of mechanisms. These include the Digital Services Act, DSA, on which political agreement was reached on 22 April 2022. The Government decided that coimisiún na meán will be the digital services co-ordinator, which is the primary regulator under the DSA. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department have led Ireland’s negotiations in this area. There is also the European Commission's code of practice on disinformation. This is a Commission initiative that has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players signing up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the DSA. Additionally, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in Dublin City University, DCU, and this body has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. While I note the intent of the amendment, this matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the DSA in Ireland. I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage. Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, coimisiún na meán would act as the primary regulator, termed the digital service co-ordinator, under the DSA. It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. The DSA is still undergoing negotiation regarding several technical matters. The final text of the regulation is not available. Should the code of practice on disinformation evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the DSA, as proposed by the European Commission, I would expect that coimisiún na meán would have a role to play in its capacity as the digital services co-ordinator. As I indicated, there is a specific problem with disinformation designed to influence the results of elections and referendums as these processes are at the heart of our democracy. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals for inclusion in the Electoral Reform Bill 2022. On amendment No. 187a, similar to amendment No. 183a, I do not propose to accept the amendment because, as previously set out, disinformation is being tackled on an EU-wide level through the mechanisms outlined. I do not want to unintentionally work at cross purposes with those mechanisms or with the work of the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The same reasons apply to amendment No. 192a in the context of my responses to amendments Nos. 183a and 187a. I am not proposing to accept these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, the purpose of the Bill is not to implement the DSA regulation in Irish law but, among other things, to create a regulatory framework for online safety and to establish a regulator to enforce that framework. The Government has decided, as I said, that coimisiún na meán will be the digital services co-ordinator under the DSA and that further legislation will be brought forward to provide for that and build upon the regulatory framework for online safety in that respect. My officials are part of a working group with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which meets weekly on the DSA. This is happening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, an coimisiúin will not have a role in the investigation or prosecution of individuals for offences specified in the criminal code. That is the role of An Garda Síochána. The role of an coimisiún is to implement a regulatory framework to minimise the availability of online content by which those offences listed in Schedule 3 of the 2009 Act, as inserted by the Bill, can be committed. The effect of this amendment would be to require that an coimisiún determines whether aspects of the regulatory framework are necessary and proportionate for an investigation or prosecution, which is a matter outside of its competency. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendment. The purpose of the Bill is not to prohibit the use of technologies by providers of designated online services and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. The technologies referenced by this amendment have legitimate uses. In particular, the reference to “encryption backdoors” would appear to prohibit the use of any encryption which is not end-to-end encryption
by a provider of a private communications or online storage service. This would be highly disproportionate. It would have significant unintended consequences, especially for providers of business-to-business technologies such as various videoconferencing solutions which, for very good reasons, may be encrypted but not end-to-end encrypted. I will, therefore, not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to clarify for the Senator that videoconferencing is included in the Bill but it will not be covered by the Digital Services Act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I note the points the Senator has made in respect of the Digital Services Act. As she will be aware, the Digital Services Act, which is a proposed regulation rather than a directive, of the EU, is currently under negotiation between the EU institutions. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is leading on this. The Digital Services Act, as a horizontal legislative instrument, will address a wide range of issues, from illegal and harmful online content to consumer rights issues such as availability of illegal goods on online platforms. It will introduce a new systemic regulatory for very large online platforms that will be overseen by the European Commission. I understand that provisional political agreement between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, representing the member states, was recently reached, subject to further technical discussions and amendments. As such, the final text of the Digital Services Act has not been formally agreed and is not yet available. A key feature of the Digital Services Act will be the appointment of a digital service co-ordinator. As I stated, in March the Government decided an coimisiún na meán will fulfil that role. A programme of work is now under way, led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to identify the appropriate resources necessary for an coimisiún and the legislative measures necessary to implement the Digital Services Act into Irish law. Although the Digital Services Act, as an EU regulation, will have a direct effect on Irish law, it has become increasingly necessary to provide legal scaffolding in domestic law to give effect to provisions of regulations, particularly regulatory provisions. For example, there is a need to provide for the designation of competent authorities or for penalties and enforcement mechanisms for infringements of a regulation. Although the Digital Services Act is forthcoming, the requirement to transpose the revised audiovisual media services directive, which we are doing through the Bill, remains. In light of the infringement proceedings under way against Ireland for a failure to transpose the Bill, it is important that we transpose the directive as soon as possible to avoid fines. Moreover, given that an coimisiún will also fulfil the function of the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act, it is important that we put that on a formal legislative footing as soon as possible. In establishing an coimisiún and setting out a regulatory framework for online safety and a robust and fair enforcement and investigation mechanism, the Bill is establishing the scaffolding to which I referred, as well as the structures to support future and forthcoming legislation, including the Digital Services Act. In this regard, the Bill will assist in the implementation of the regulation and it will not, therefore, hinder it. I do not accept the amendment, but I have noted the Senator's points and will reflect on them.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendments. I cannot accept amendment No. 188 because, as a matter of principle, I cannot accept amendments that would unduly limit the discretion of the comisiún in the creation and maintenance of regulatory codes. However, the proposal in amendment No. 189 is a good one and while I reject the amendment today, I am considering the matter for Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is important to note that not all online safety codes will apply to every designated online service. The designation of online services for regulation and the application of different online safety codes to them is based on assessments of risk. As such, requiring the provision of information from providers of designated online services of their compliance with all online safety codes does not align with the model of regulation provided for in the Bill. An coimisiún is empowered to require the provision of large volumes of technical, detailed and commercially-sensitive information from providers of designated online services in order to assess their compliance with online safety codes. I do not see that it would be desirable or practical to lay such information before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendment. We agree that it is important that the Bill contains robust and proportionate powers of investigation and enforcement sufficient to ensure compliance with the online safety codes issued by an coimisiún. As the Senators will be aware, the Bill as initiated already provides for significant administrative financial sanctions in respect of a contravention under the Bill and for the liability of a director or manager of a designated online service for a specified criminal offence in situations where a contravention continues following the decision of an coimisiún. Section 139Y of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, defines failure to comply with an online safety code as a contravention under the Act. It is important to note that a contravention is not in itself a criminal offence under the Act. The Bill sets out a clear process for investigation of a contravention which begins with the appointment of an authorised officer to carry out an investigation and make a report to an coimisiún. The Bill provides significant powers to authorised officers, including powers of search and seizure. Following their investigation of a contravention, an authorised officer must prepare a report to present to an coimisiún for its decision. On receipt of the report, an coimisiún shall, on the balance of probabilities, decide whether or not a contravention has been committed by a provider of a designated online service and whether to impose administrative financial sanction. It may impose administrative financial sanctions of up to €20 million, or 10% of the turnover. Given the scale of some of the designated online services which will be regulated by an coimisiún, a sanction of 10% of turnover may run into the hundreds of millions of euro. If a provider of a designated online service continues to commit a contravention following a decision of an coimisiún, section 139ZT of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may issue a notice requiring the provider to put an end to the contravention. If the provider fails to comply with such a notice, a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the provider can be held liable for the criminal offence of failing to comply with a notice by coimisiún na meán to put an end to a contravention. The criminal offence is a category 1 offence under the Bill, which is set out in section 139ZZ of the Act, as amended, as an offence for which a person is liable (a) on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or (b) on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both. The provision is tightly drawn and limited to circumstances in which the facts underlying the offence and indeed secondary liability in respect of it are provable in practical terms. This is very important and the legitimacy of the regulatory framework and the legislation will hinge in many respects on its operability. I want to emphasise that the provision for secondary criminal liability in the Bill was arrived at following extensive consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences. The amendment brought forward by the Senators is intended to set out a new offence which would apply when a designated online service has failed to comply with an online safety code in the first instance and for associated criminal liability. I absolutely understand the point the Senators are making regarding the dissuasive effects of applying criminal sanctions in the first instance of a failure to comply with an online safety code, rather than following a failure to comply with a notice issued by an coimisiún. However, I am advised that the dissuasion sought could only occur if the offence was provable in practical terms to the legal standard of "beyond reasonable doubt". This is achievable in the circumstances in which the Bill provides for secondary criminal liability but I am advised that there are doubts as to whether that would be the case in the circumstances described by the Senators. In addition, the intention of the Senators here would provide a legislative choice to an coimisiún where it has determined a contravention has occurred to either pursue the imposition of an administrative financial sanction, or prosecute or pursue the prosecution of a provider of a designated online service for an offence tied to that contravention and potentially a secondary prosecution against a senior manager. Where such a legislative choice exists, the question arises as to how an coimisiún would choose between these courses of action, particularly as they have different legal standards of proof attached to them. This creates a decision point which would be subject to judicial review and in respect of which it would be difficult for an coimisiún to defend its choosing either course of action. A mischievous actor could easily make an argument that an coimisiún is only pursuing an administrative financial sanction because it does not have sufficient proof to pursue a criminal case and that an coimisiún is denying the provider due process on that basis. I have no intention of introducing such an opportunity into this Bill. For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Senator said, this is ground-breaking legislation. It represents the first steps to regulate user-generated online content. In establishing a whole new regulatory framework and regulator to enforce it, Coimisiún na Meán, the Bill lays a foundation that we can build on. There will be changes to the regulatory framework, driven by initiatives taken at EU level, for example, not least through the recently agreed EU digital services Act, which does not take the approach proposed by the Senator. It is important that the regulatory framework that we are establishing as a foundation stone is effective and that any provisions we include are applicable in practice by Coimisiún na Meán. It is important in that context that consideration is given to the investigation and enforcement regime set out in the Bill so that it can be done in practice. I meant to refer to the comparisons between the provisions for secondary criminal liability in this Bill and other legislation, such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, as amended. The offences set out in that Act for secondary criminal liability attach focus to failures by persons to comply with the provisions of that Act, including failures to discharge clearly identified duties or non-compliance with requirements to prepare plans. Such provisions would have more in common with the existing provision in the Bill which attaches criminal liability to the failure to comply with a notice to end a contravention issued by the coimisiún, given that the facts of compliance or non-compliance would be relatively clear, which is an important consideration when the matter must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. As I said earlier, my advice is that the dissuasion the Senator seeks could only occur if the offence was provable, in practical terms, to the legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. This is achievable in circumstances in which the Bill provides for secondary criminal liability. I am advised that there are doubts as to whether that would be the case in the circumstances the Senator describes. It is vital that those who contravene the regulatory provisions can be sanctioned appropriately and effectively, up to and including criminal sanctions. We agree on that. The approach we have taken followed extensive engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences. I have outlined the sanctions of €20 million or up to 10% of the turnover for non-compliance. The coimisiún may issue a notice to end that non-compliance. Failure to comply can lead to an offence for which officers may be found liable. My advice is that this is just not workable and that what we have in the Bill, after extensive engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences, is what is workable, which is why it is in the Bill. I am sure there will be engagement with officials on other amendments. I have committed to that between now and Report Stage. I am sure this will arise in the engagement. I am being straight with the Senator that I will not commit, because my advice as it stands is that this is not workable. That does not stop the Senator from engaging further with the officials. I am happy for that to take place, because I know it will happen with other amendments the Senator has tabled. I am not committing to anything. It would not be fair for me to say I will bring something in on Report Stage. Engagement will happen. My advice, as it stands, is that what we have provided for in the Bill is workable and the amendment is not.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They will not be in a position to share the advice but they will discuss the principles with the Senator.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I have said previously, it is not usual practice to lay internal records of processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas, nor for the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to store such materials. As such, I do not see the value in doing so. Regarding the matter of the records of consultations, I again note that I understand the intention of the amendment is to ensure the transparency of the comisiún in respect of those persons it seeks to consult with. However, as I said previously, as a public body, the comisiún will be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability requirements, including to the Oireachtas joint committee. For that reason, I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for tabling the amendment. The purpose of section 139X of the 2009 Act as inserted by the Bill is to require the comisiún to develop a strategy to ensure its compliance with the provisions of the e-commerce directive 2000 regarding the liability framework for intermediary service providers set out in that directive. The purpose of this provision does not relate to the matters raised by the Senator’s amendment and, as such, I do not accept it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I acknowledge the importance of ensuring that the offence-specific category of harmful online content appropriately covers all online content that relates to the offence of assault. I understand that the intention of amendments Nos. 194a and 194b is to ensure that the use of "force" does not unintentionally exclude the non-contact application of such, for example, through online content. I am satisfied that this is not the case, as "force", which is defined in section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, includes, for example, the application of light. As I consider the effect of these amendments to be provided for in the Bill, I will not accept it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To be clear, the definition of "force" in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 includes, as specified in section 2(2)(a) of that Act, "application of heat, light, electric current, noise or any other form of energy". I do not see a circumstance in which the matter raised by the Senator would not be covered.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am confident of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On amendment No. 196, I do not see the value in inserting the word "reasonably" into the provision. The circumstances in which an authorised officer may use his or her powers are set down comprehensively in section 139ZC and are, among other things, subject to considerations of reasonableness. On amendment No. 197, section 139ZC clearly provides that an authorised officer cannot keep material or equipment obtained in the course of an investigation in perpetuity and that, during the course of an investigation, may keep such materials or equipment for a period deemed reasonably necessary. This discretion is proper and sufficiently drawn to mitigate against unnecessary retention of equipment and materials. I do not believe that requiring an authorised officer's supervisor to statutorily review this matter every eight weeks is proportionate. It would be an unnecessary administrative burden, especially during lengthy investigations. Amendment No. 198 is not substantially different to the present provision in the Bill enabling an authorised officer to be accompanied by a member of An Garda Síochána and anyone the officer considers appropriate. Accordingly, I am not accepting these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 139ZC clearly provides than an authorised officer cannot keep material or equipment obtained in the course of an investigation in perpetuity and that during the course of an investigation the officer may keep such materials or equipment for such a period as deemed reasonably necessary. This discretion is proper and sufficiently drawn to mitigate against unnecessary retention of equipment and materials. Furthermore, it is clear that authorised officers do not have the power to keep such equipment or material upon the conclusion of an investigation. I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	First, I note that the indemnification of authorised officers is a standard and necessary legislative provision. In this regard, the proposed deletion of the relevant provision by amendment No. 200 is not something I can accept. What the provision does is to squarely place the legal responsibility for the actions of an authorised officer on coimisiún na meán, except where the officer acts in bad faith. It is right and proper that complaints in respect of the actions of a person engaged by an coimisiún to carry out an investigation should first and foremost be directed at an coimisiún. Otherwise, a bad actor could stymie investigations simply by threatening legal action against the investigator as an individual. As regards amendment No. 201, it is difficult to understand why the exercise of such an important legal provision should be subject solely to the quantity of claims against an authorised officer. One can easily imagine a mischievous actor making several separate claims to exceed the threshold in order to be able to bring a claim directly against the authorised officer. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As regards amendment No. 202, I do not see the value of specifying a maximum timeframe of eight months for an authorised officer to draft the report of an investigation. The wording of the Bill at present is: "As soon as is practicable after the completion of an investigation, the authorised officer shall prepare a draft report of the investigation." In my view, this is sufficient to ensure the draft report will be prepared within a reasonable time, depending on the nature of the investigation, whether it is within weeks or months. As regards amendment No. 203, I believe the section as currently worded, particularly the reference to fairness, covers matters of necessity and proportionality that may arise in respect of rules relating to the conduct of investigations. In this regard, I note that an coimisiún and its officers will be subject to the extensive provisions in this Part on how investigations may be carried out, and that there are more than sufficient principles and policies in this respect. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendments. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 139ZG of the 2009 Act, as inserted by this Bill, requires an coimisiún to publish guidelines made by it in respect of the operation of the enforcement provisions of the Bill. It is proper that an coimisiún should be subject to the same obligation in respect of rules made by it under section 139ZF regarding the conduct of investigations. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment but I am considering the matter for Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I understand the purpose of the amendment and that it is trying to mitigate against perceived delays to the execution of enforcement decisions, whether the granting of a judicial review should override or pause the application of a decision of an coimisiún is a matter for the courts. In relation to this matter, I note that section 38 of the 2009 Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies how applications for judicial review regarding decisions by an coimisiún shall be treated under this Bill, including in terms of timescales, the matters that may be considered, the staying of proceedings and the role of various courts. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Senator is a agreeable, I will get my officials to get back to her.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As a matter of public policy, the treatment of moneys raised through administrative financial sanctions is for such moneys to be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. Hypothecating the moneys, as the Senator suggests, would be counter to this policy. In addition, it would appear to create an incentive for coimisiún na meán to attempt to impose more or higher financial penalties than warranted in order to increase its own operating budget since it will have a function in promoting media literacy. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment aims to enable coimisiún na meán to issue a content limitation notice to restrict the availability of specified content to people aged 18 or over. This would be in cases where the content appears to an coimisiún to fall within the definition of "age-inappropriate content" in section 44, by inserting section 139D into the 2009 Act. In this regard, it is important to note that the content limitation notice provisions in section 46, inserting sections 139ZV to 139ZY into the 2009 Act, are limited in application to "harmful online content" and not to "age-inappropriate online content". This is to limit the potential involvement of coimisiún na meán in matters regarding individual pieces of content to only that content expressly deemed harmful under the Bill. The definition of "age-inappropriate online content" does not constitute a category of "harmful online content" under the legislation, but rather stands separately and is intended to inform the creation of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices. Section 44 is inserting sections 139R to 139T into the 2009 Act rather than online safety codes and, as such, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for bringing forward amendments Nos. 208 to 227, inclusive, which relate to the European works levy and scheme provisions contained in section 53. I acknowledge that this is an important issue for the Irish audiovisual sector and it is one on which my officials have engaged extensively with the sector. By way of background, Article 13(2) of the audiovisual media services directive gives member states the option to levy media service providers under their jurisdiction or which are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories. The proceeds of such a levy must be used to fund the production of European works. Section 53 exercises this option by providing for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund a content production scheme to support the production of European works, which of course includes Irish works. The section further provides that funds raised by the levy can be used to support the production of new audiovisual programmes across a number of areas, including Irish culture and language, climate change, and equality, diversity and inclusion. Both the levy and the associated scheme will be administered by coimisiún na meán. The section also provides that a minimum of 25% of funds raised by the content production levy shall be for the production of programmes in the Irish language. As Senators will be aware, there are a range of public funding measures in place to support the production of audiovisual works in the State, including through the section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland, the sound and vision scheme operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and through our public service broadcasters, TG4 and RTÉ, which are funded through the Exchequer and television licence fee, respectively. In 2020, these supports collectively amounted to over €198 million. The content production levy will provide the means to provide further support to the audiovisual sector, which has been an Irish success story. Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 provide that an order imposing a levy on the media service providers shall be not less than 3% but not more than 5% of their revenues from subscribers and-or advertising revenues. It is my view that it is not appropriate to set out a percentage for the levy in primary legislation, given the need to carry out further research into the risks and benefits of such a measure. Setting a specified rate in legislation is inflexible, as it would prevent an coimisiún from varying the rate following any research it may carry out or subject to changing circumstances. It is important to note that any levy system will have to abide by the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination under EU law. Accordingly, any levy will be imposed equally on all audiovisual media services targeting the Irish market, both those based outside Ireland and Irish media service providers, such as RTÉ and Virgin Media Television, will also be subject to this levy. In addition, Irish services and services based elsewhere in the European Union would be eligible to apply to the content production fund established as a result of the levy.Furthermore, it should be noted that any levy will only apply to income earned within the State. For example, if a provider such as Netflix earns 2% of its overall EU revenues in the State, the levy can only apply to that 2% of its overall revenues. These factors could significantly constrain the overall positive impact on the potential level of additional funding for Irish content.  Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 also provide for the inclusion of timelines requiring the content production levy to be commenced by a specified period. I intend to commence the provisions of the Bill giving effect to content production levy after coimisiún na meán has carried out independent research into the viability of such a levy in an Irish context. It is important that a thorough examination of these issues is undertaken in order to avoid any unintended consequences arising from the introduction of a levy. It is intended that an examination of the content production levy will be among an coimisiún’s priorities on establishment. I expect that an coimisiún will carry out a programme of stakeholder engagement on the matter and will subsequently report to me with its recommendations. For the reasons I have set out, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 208 and 209. Amendment No. 210 provides that the content production levy shall be calculated on the amount of the subscriptions collected from audiences in the State, and on the amount paid to media service providers by advertisers for advertisements targeting audiences in the State. The amendment also proposes that the levy order should have effect for a minimum period of five years. Similar to amendments Nos. 209 and 210, I do not intend to accept this amendment as I believe specific details regarding the calculation of the levy should only be decided following a thorough examination of the content levy. Setting out such detail in primary legislation would constrain the options available to an coimisiún in making a levy order. Amendment No. 212 provides that a content production scheme or schemes shall be made as soon as possible after 1 January 2023. Amendment No. 213 serves a similar purpose by obliging an coimisiún to implement a content production scheme as soon as possible after establishment. Given I do not intend to commence the content production levy until the necessary research has been undertaken to inform the levy design I cannot accept amendments Nos. 212 and 213. Amendment No. 214 is a consequential amendment to the previous amendment and I therefore do not intend to accept it. I understand the intention of amendment No. 211 arises from a concern that sections 21 and 22 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, which relate to the industry levy imposed for the purposes of funding the operational costs of an coimisiún, may adversely impact the operation of the content production levy and cause confusion as to which levy is being referred to. Section 159E(8) provides that the terms "levy" and "levy order" should be construed in relation to sections 159E and 159F only. Section 21(12) provides that the terms "levy order" and "levy period" used in sections 21 and 22 should be construed in relation to those sections only. I am advised that this ensures a clear delineation between the levy set out in sections 21 and 22 and that set out in section 159E. Accordingly, I am not accepting amendment No. 211. Amendment No. 215 sets out additional detail in terms of the nature of programmes to be funded under a scheme, and specifies that drama, films, animation and factual programmes can be funded under a scheme. In addition, it sets out that a scheme should specifically fund works by Irish creative talent. The amendment also sets out that a scheme can provide development funding to support the production of audiovisual works. First, the additional detail included in the paragraph (c) of the amendment regarding the types of programming to be funded appears to achieve the same policy intent as the current wording of the section. The wording of section 159F(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 53 of the Bill, provides that a scheme can fund the production of audiovisual programmes. As this wording already captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes, I am therefore of the view that it is unnecessary to include any specific detail in this element of the provision. Paragraph (b) of this amendment proposes that a content production scheme would specifically support works which relate specifically to the works of Irish creative talent. On the fact of it, the intrinsic quality of works of Irish creative talent would be appear to be that such works are produced by Irish citizens. This would imply that persons of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme. While I am of course strongly in favour of doing all we can to support Irish creatives, this element would run contrary to European Union law on non-discrimination as it would appear to place Irish nationals at an advantage over nationals or residents of other member states.  Paragraph (d) of this amendment adds a clarification that a content production scheme may make provision for development funding for programmes funded under this section. While I am of the view that the existing provision in the Bill as currently drafted already provides for this, I acknowledge that there is scope to add further clarity regarding development funding. Accordingly, I have asked my officials to consider the matter further with a view to bringing forward an amendment. At this point, I would signal that my intention is to address any amendments to the content production levy and scheme on Dáil Committee Stage rather than in this House, to allow for meaningful engagement with stakeholders on this issue. Accordingly, while I cannot accept amendment No. 215, I hope to address some of the concerns raised by the amendment. Amendments Nos. 216 to 221, inclusive, seek to amend the language applying to the kind of audiovisual programmes which may be funded by a content production scheme with a view to further specifying the scope of content which may be supported. Amendment No. 216 adds the term "diverse" before the reference to "experiences of the people of the island of Ireland" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I understand the intention of the amendment. However, I believe that the term "experiences of the people of the island of Ireland" necessarily carries with it the recognition that such experiences shall be diverse, given the existing diversity among our people. I do not therefore intend to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 217 amends the term "people of Irish ancestry living abroad" to "people of Irish origin or ancestry living abroad" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I understand the intention of the amendment but believe that the term "Irish ancestry" already incorporates people of Irish origin living abroad. The term "ancestry" is not intended refer to ethnic origin in a way that implies racial connotations. Instead, the term is intended to refer to origin, at some point, on our island in all its diversity, both past and present. I do not therefore intend to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 218 adds the term "biodiversity" to "environmental sustainability and climate change" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I recognise the intention of the amendment. I am open to amendment on this and intend to return to the matter on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 219 deletes the term "including" in the phrase "human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I understand the question here is whether the phrasing implies that equality, diversity and inclusion should be considered under the rubric of the overarching idea of human rights or whether they should be considered separate concepts. I think this may be a philosophical question which will not have a substantive impact on the kind of audiovisual programmes which may be supported by a content production scheme. For that reason, I intend to reject the amendment.  Amendment No. 220 inserts a provision specifying that new audiovisual programmes may, through a content production scheme, support literacy in the Irish language, or support literacy in Irish Sign Language. In terms of literacy in the Irish language I believe that this may be covered by the reference to the Irish language in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F. As regards literacy in Irish Sign Language, I will further consider whether the references to the types of audiovisual programmes referenced in subsection (2) would encompass programmes relating to literacy in ISL and return to the House on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 221 would specify that new audiovisual programmes in relation to digital empowerment and data protection awareness may, through a content production scheme, be funded. I believe that the references to science and education in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F would already allow such programmes to be funded. Therefore, I do not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 222 would specify that support under a content production scheme may be given in relation to capacity building. I believe the intention of the amendment is already captured by paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 159F which provides that support under the scheme may be given in respect of research, assessments of need, feasibility studies or pilot projects. The insertion of the term "capacity building" would be too expansive. The purpose of a content production scheme is to fund new audiovisual programmes. The term "capacity building" implies that a content production scheme could be used, for example, in skills development. I believe that skills development in the sector is more appropriately progressed by Screen Ireland through Screen Skills Ireland, which is Ireland’s screen industry training resource. As such, I am not accepting the amendment. However, as I indicated in my response to amendment No. 215, I can see the merit in inserting a reference to development funding in paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 159F. This reference is not as capacious as "capacity building" but may capture the intent of amendment No. 222.  Amendment No. 223 provides that a content production scheme shall dedicate not less than 80% of the funding available under each scheme to audiovisual works that are developed or produced by independent production companies, as described in, and which qualify as an independent programme under section 116(12) of the Broadcasting Act 2009. The amendment further seeks to provide for a fair and equitable balance in relation to the allocation of rights ownership in those works funded by a scheme under this section.The amendment also provides that a funding scheme under the section could be managed by an coimisiún in co-partnership with another agency or that its management may be delegated by an coimisiún to another agency on such terms and conditions as an coimisiún shall prescribe. In regard to the proposal to dedicate at least 80% of funding from a scheme to independent productions, I can see the merit in specifying that the Bill contains an explicit acknowledgement that the independent productions can benefit from funding through a scheme made under the section and I have, therefore, asked my officials to examine this matter further with a view to bringing forward a Government amendment in the context of Dáil Committee Stage. In particular I will ask them to examine an appropriate definitions of "independent programmes" and "independent production company", and the appropriate percentage.  The issue of rights ownership is a complex issue that cuts across the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Given the need for further extensive policy analysis and consultation in the matter to ascertain the implications of providing for this in legislation and the fact that this issue is not provided for in the AVMSD, I will ask my officials to further examine the issue. Regarding the proposal that a funding scheme under the section could be in co-partnership with another State agency or that the management of a scheme could be delegated entirely to another State agency, I do not see the value in this portion of the proposed amendment. I am confident that an coimisiún will effectively manage the funding scheme, should it be introduced, given it will operate as both a media development agency and a regulatory body. My Department is currently working with the Public Appointments Service to launch an executive search for the commissioner and executive chairperson posts. This will include a media development commissioner who will take responsibility for the funding and development of the wider media sector. Given an coimisiún will be responsible for the content production levy, it is appropriate that it is also the body responsible for the implementation of content production schemes and I expect that the media development commissioner will work closely with Screen Ireland with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes. Given the complexity of the proposed amendment, I intend to ask my officials to carry out further consultation and analysis with a view to returning to some of these matters on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  Amendment No. 224 is a consequential amendment following on from amendment No. 223 and, therefore, I do not accept it.  Amendment No. 225 provides that an coimisiún, in preparing a content production scheme, shall have regard for the need to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in new audiovisual programmes funded by schemes made under this section. I recognise the intention of the amendment, and I would be concerned that specifying that any one group should be prioritised for participation would imply that other groups, such as an ethnic minority, would not be prioritised. I wish to give this matter further consideration on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 226 provides that an coimisiún, in preparing a content production scheme, shall have regard for the need to support cultural and social participation, access to programming for the use of the Irish language and Irish Sign Language. Similar to amendment No. 220, I believe that some of the proposed amendments may be encompassed under section 159F(2)(a). However, as with amendment No. 220, I will give further consideration to the amendment in the context of Report Stage.  Amendment No. 227 provides that an coimisiún, in preparing schemes under this section, shall have regard for the need to support the development of community broadcasters. The Bill as initiated sets out that an coimisiún shall encourage the development of community broadcasters and, therefore, I do not see a substantive distinction between the terms "support" and "encourage". Accordingly I proposed to reject the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On amendments Nos. 208, 209, 212, 213 and 214, I have said that the content production levy has the potential to raise funds to further support the audiovisual sector. It is really important in that context that the levy is effective and efficient in its design and application. That is why we are giving time to the commission to do that research and make sure it works properly.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments, which seek to replace the phrase "political end" in the Bill with a definition of "political purposes", with the aim of amending the current definition of "an advertisement towards a political end". As I set out on Committee Stage, the term "an advertisement towards a political end" has been defined in the 1998 High Court judgment in Colgan v. the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC. This case involved an appeal against a decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to prohibit broadcasters from broadcasting an anti-abortion advertisement prepared by the organisation Youth Defence. The definition used in Colgan v. IRTC is currently used by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. In fact, the authority has a guidance note on its website which sets out, in accordance with the judgment, the practical meaning of the phrase. I note that the proposed definition of "political purposes" stems from the Senators' proposal to amend section 22(2)(aa) of the Electoral Act 1997 as part of this House's consideration of the Electoral Reform Bill. Given that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, did not accept this proposal, I cannot accept it either. However, I understand that the Minister of State has set out on a number of occasions that the electoral commission, once established, will carry out a comprehensive review of aspects of election legislation in Ireland, including in respect of the definition of "political purposes".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 5 and 15 are intended to replace two references to user-generated video with references to user-generated content. Amendment No. 5 will amend the definition of “commercial communication” to replace the reference to user-generated video with a reference to user-generated content. Amendment No. 15 will amend a line in section 7 regarding the functions of an coimisiún in respect of regulatory arrangements to again replace the reference to user-generated videos with a reference to user-generated content. The reason for this is that user-generated content refers to all forms of user-generated material, whereas user-generated video only refers to video material that is generated by users. These errors were noticed during consideration of a number of the amendments proposed by Senators on Committee Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 5 will amend the definition of "commercial communication” to replace the reference to user-generated video with a reference to user-generated content.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While also addressing a number of amendments tabled by Senators on Committee Stage, the Government amendments in this group give effect to my commitment to explicitly provide for the role of online safety commissioner in the Bill. This was a key recommendation of the report of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media in its report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill. In this regard, amendment No. 6 provides for relevant definitions for the operation of this provision, including a definition of the online safety commissioner. Amendment No. 37
ensures that the online safety functions of coimisiún na meán are generally delegated to any designated online safety commissioners.Amendment No. 44 provides that "One or more of the Commissioners shall be designated in writing by the Minister on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service as an Online Safety Commissioner". It is important to recognise that the online safety functions of coimisiún na meán are likely to expand significantly over time and, as such, it is important to provide that more than one commissioner can be designated as an online safety commissioner. In this regard, it is intended that the Public Appointments Service will commence a public recruitment campaign for the role of online safety commissioner in the coming weeks. Amendments Nos. 36, 38, 39, 45 to 50, inclusive, and 53 are all consequential amendments to provide for updates to the numbering of subsections subsequent to those inserted by amendments Nos. 37 and 44. I recognise the intentions of amendments Nos. 40 and 51, proposed by Senators Higgins and Ruane and Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, respectively, but note the issue they raise is addressed by the Government amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 7 is intended to address matters raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne, Cassells, Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage. Section 7(2)(b) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of the Bill requires that, in performing its functions, an coimisiún shall endeavour to ensure that the interests of the public, and the interests of children in particular, are protected. This amendment will further clarify this provision. With regard to the matter of child safety raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, this amendment provides that, in protecting the interests of children, an coimisiún will have particular commitment to the safety of children. As to the matter of promoting the interests of the public and children raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane, I am confident that the inserting the term "commitment" will clarify that coimisiún na meán will both guard and promote the interests of children as regards their safety. I note that the issue raised by amendment No. 9 tabled by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells is addressed by the amendment I have brought. I set out some of my concerns regarding amendment No. 8 on Committee Stage. I remain of the view that it is not appropriate to highlight the rights of privacy and reputation in relation to the functions of coimisiún na meán. The mechanism to protect and vindicate these rights is set out in other legislative instruments, specifically the Data Protection Act 2018 and the general data protection regulation in relation to privacy and the Defamation Act 2009 in relation to reputation. A reference to those rights may give rise to the expectation or inference that an coimisiún has some specific function in protecting those rights. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 address matters raised by Senators Warfield, Ó Donnghaile, Gavan, Boylan, Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage as regards the representation and participation of people on broadcasting and video-on-demand services. Section 7(2)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, requires that an coimisiún shall endeavour to ensure that broadcasting and video on-demand services available in the State are open, inclusive and pluralistic, bearing in mind various characteristics of the people of Ireland. In this regard, these amendments require coimisiún na meán to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland in terms of its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services. A distinction is made between participation, which means involvement in the activities of those services, and representation, which means being in programmes made available by those services. Furthermore, by locating this amendment within the matters regarding the people of the island of Ireland that coimisiún na meán must bear in mind in respect of its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services, the amendment covers the participation and representation of all groups of people living on this island. While consideration was given to specifying specific groups or protected characteristics in this amendment, I think it prudent to ensure that the amendment is drafted to cover all the people of our island in all of their diversity in order that there is no implication that any people are omitted by this provision, particularly cultural minorities. On amendment No. 14, amendment No. 12 addresses the concern regarding the right to and importance of cultural participation, which is a right ultimately set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 16 would require the commission to endeavour to ensure that regulatory arrangements support equality, human rights and participation in cultural life. I agree that these should be important principles in guiding the work of the commission and I believe that these principles are set out in various provisions of the Bill as appropriate. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment. Regarding amendment No. 17, addressing climate change and environmental degradation are some of the greatest challenges of our time. This will of course impact not only the media sector but our entire society. This Government has taken action through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the adoption of carbon budgets and the comprehensive climate action plan. I agree it is important that an coimisiún should take account of these matters. That is why section 7(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, requires the commission to take account of the policies of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications as regards climate change and environmental sustainability. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 18 addresses a matter raised by Senators Warfield, Ó Donnghaile, Gavan and Boylan during Committee Stage. This amendment, and its consequential amendments Nos. 19 to 22, inclusive, 28, 29 and 129, require coimisiún na meán to promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by communications media operating in the State. In this regard, communications media is defined in the Bill as:(a) broadcasting services,(b) audiovisual on-demand media services,(c) designated online services, or(d) newspapers or periodicals consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs;As such, the amendment places a broad duty on an coimisiún to promote the use of the Irish language, both in terms of business use and content, by media in Ireland. The Bill as initiated had already set out the responsibility of an coimisiún to promote and stimulate the development of programmes in the Irish language, so this amendment is effectively further clarifying the important role an coimisiún will play as regards the promotion of the Irish language.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think the Senator may be speaking to the next grouping.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 23 to 25, inclusive, address a number of matters raised by Senators Carrigy, Malcolm Byrne, Cassells, Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage.As discussed on Committee Stage, section 7(3)(f) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, sets out the role of an coimisiún in researching, promoting and endorsing educational activities and co-operating with educational bodies in relation to all matters relating to its functions. This wide provision is designed to enable an coimisiún to play a key educational function regarding online safety and media literacy, amongst other matters under its remit. On Committee Stage, Senators suggested that this provision should be further clarified to ensure that an coimisiún could work with a wide array of bodies. In response to those points, amendment No. 25 in particular provides for specific references to coimisiún na meán engaging with sporting bodies, as raised by Senator Carrigy, and community bodies, as raised by Senators Ruane and Higgins, in relation to co-operation regarding educational initiatives and activities. This amendment also provides for specific reference to training bodies and local and representative bodies in this regard. As suggested by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, amendment No. 24 inserts a specific reference to media literacy. I thank the Senators for their work on Committee Stage. Regarding amendments Nos. 26 and 27, I note that the matters raised within them are dealt with by the amendment I am bringing and accordingly I do not intend to accept those amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 30 addresses a number of matters raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Shane Cassells on Committee Stage, specifically the suggestion that coimisiún na meán should have regard to the policies of relevant Ministers and the Government regarding the safety of children and the regulation of gambling. This amendment provides for these matters by referring to the relevant Ministers with regard to each matter. For example, it refers to the Minister for Justice with regard to the regulation of gambling. It requires coimisiún na meán to have regard to the published policies of that Minister and the Government on that matter. Lead responsibilities for these matters remains with the relevant Minister and the public bodies under the Minister's aegis. I note the matters raised in amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are addressed by amendment No. 30 and, accordingly, I am not accepting them. Amendments Nos. 33 to 35, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Shane Cassells on Committee Stage and give further effect to the provision in amendment No. 30 stating that the coimisiún shall have regard to the policies of the Minister for Justice regarding the regulation of gambling. Amendment No. 35 states that coimisiún na meán, "co-operate, in relation to the regulation of gambling, with any public body concerned with that matter." The reference to public bodies in this regard is designed to account for the current situation where the regulation of gambling in Ireland is the responsibility of multiple public bodies. The proposed scenario under the gambling regulation Bill foresees a gambling authority having primary responsibility in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If it is a published policy then the Government must have regard to it. Does that clarify it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If it is a published policy by Government, then yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive. The posts of commissioner and executive chair of Coimisiún na Meán will be vitally important. They will collectively constitute an coimisiún itself and ultimately be responsible for the decisions that it will take. It is important to note at the outset that the commissioners are not simply equivalent to board members. They will be fulfilling executive functions and will be considered employees of an coimisiún. As such, the provisions of employment law apply to these appointments. This is a model adopted from other regulators in the State, such as ComReg and Commission for Regulation of Utilities. I understand that each of the amendments are based broadly on the provisions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 which relate to the appointment of members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. However, the more appropriate comparator for the commissioner roles in an coimisiún would be the director rather than the members of IHREC.  On amendment No. 41, as I previously stated on Committee Stage, I do not think it appropriate to set out a non-exhaustive set of knowledge or expertise required for an coimisiún. Matters pertaining to the selection criteria are best addressed within the context of the recruitment process run by the Public Appointments Service. Accordingly, I am not accepting this amendment.  I have previously addressed the point raised in amendment No. 43 during Committee Stage a number of times. As I noted then, the duty set out in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 is already binding on public bodies, and I do not see the relevance or merit of singling out any single UN convention unless absolutely appropriate to do. Accordingly I am not accepting this amendment. On amendment No. 42, I did consider amendments proposed on Committee Stage which aimed to achieve a gender balance among commissioners, which is something I fully support in principle. The legal advice my Department received was that providing for the membership of a minimum number of women on Coimisiún na Meán, as envisaged by the proposed amendments, would be contrary to section 8 of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998-2015, as it may lead to discrimination on the grounds of gender. This Act prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee or prospective employee in relation to access to employment, which includes the recruitment process, and Article 14(1)(a) of directive 2006/54/EC, which provides for the equal treatment of men and women in terms of, among other things, access to employment.  The specialist nature of the commissioner posts, for example the online safety commissioner, is such that each post will be recruited individually, rather than as a part of a panel of commissioners. Accordingly, a requirement in law for a minimum number of women, or indeed men, in commissioner posts would compel the Public Appointments Service, at some point, to advertise a post open only to candidates of a particular gender, depending on the composition of the commission at any one time. This would be contrary to the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 – 2015. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 42. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 56 addresses a matter raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to require coimisiún na mean to establish a youth advisory committee as one of its advisory committees. In the drafting of the amendment, it was considered the age group the committee should represent should be those under 25 years of age including children, and that at least half of its members should be not more than 25 years of age. In this regard, the stated age profile aligns with the categorisation of young people being those persons under 25 years of age under the provisions for content production schemes at section 159F of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by the Bill. The amendment provides that the youth advisory committee shall include representatives nominated, at the invitation of an coimisiún, by organisations representing children or young people. Finally, the amendment specifies that, in particular, the youth advisory committee shall advise an coimisiún on online safety matters. This is a recognition of the importance of the voice of young people in online safety in particular. They are often at the coalface of new technologies and, unfortunately, of some of the harms that can arise from them. The matter raised by amendment No. 57 has been dealt with by the Government amendment in this grouping.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 59 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage to explicitly require coimisiún na meán to have regard to the effective use of its resources as well as the economic and efficient use of resources in preparing its statement of strategy and work programme. While section 27(1)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, sets out that the executive chairperson of an coimisiún would be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the effectiveness of its operations, I believe this amendment is useful clarification that an coimsiún shall have regard to all three components of the value-for-money framework for the public service, namely, efficiency, effectiveness and economy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 60 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding a requirement for coimisiún na meán, on the direction of the Minister, to provide its statement of strategy to relevant Oireachtas committees. This will allow the strategy statement to multiple Oireachtas committees where, for example, an coimisiún may be fulfilling functions of policy interest to those committees. Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 address a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding the co-operation agreements an coimisiún may enter into with bodies within and outside the State. The purpose of these amendments is to require an coimisiún to provide the joint committee with a copy of any co-operation agreements it enters into and publish any such co-operation agreements on a website maintained by it subject to the consent of all parties to the agreement any redactions that may be necessary. I thank the Senators for raising these matters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 64 and those that are consequential to it, namely, amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senator Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding the notification of a person when his or her personal data is disclosed by an coimisiún. Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by this Bill, sets out the circumstances in which and the bodies to which an coimisiún may disclose a person's personal data. The purpose of these amendments is to require coimisiún na meán to endeavour to notify a person whose personal data under this section. This duty is qualified by the phrase "in so far as it is practicable to do so" to avoid an coimisiún being derelict in this duty by virtue of a person becoming highly difficult or impossible to contact. The intention behind amendment No. 63 is sufficiently captured in subsection 2 of section 33 of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by this Bill. Throughout subsection 2, it is specified that the commission shall only disclose personal data where it considers that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes set out in the various paragraphs of subsection 2. As a result, I am not accepting amendment No. 63. Amendment No. 68 and the amendments consequential to it, namely, amendments Nos. 69 to 71, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding data protection impact assessments. The purpose of these amendments is to require the Minister where they are prescribed by statutory instrument either new bodies to which the commission may disclose personal data or new matters regarding which the commission may disclose personal data to consider where necessary carrying out a data protection impact assessment and if so, to carry out that assessment. It is must be noted that section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act 2018 already requires a Minister proposing a legislative measure relating to the processing of personal data to consult with the Data Protection Commission during the process of preparing the legislative measure in question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I set out on Committee Stage, I would be concerned that, as drafted, this amendment would have the unintended consequence of preventing an employee of an coimisiún from seeking to influence any considerations of an coimisiún regarding the contract of that employee. This amendment would seem to prevent employees from representing their interests to an coimisiún, their employer. This provision in the Bill, as currently drafted, was designed to prevent those very such scenarios from occurring. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendment but the figure of €2 million is derived from the definition of a media business set out in Part 3 A of the Competition Act, as amended, which provides for a framework by which we assess media mergers in the State. For reasons of consistency and proportionality, we should continue to use this figure. I cannot accept the Senator’s amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding amendments Nos. 75 and 76, I am still considering this matter in the context of bringing a possible amendment on Dáil Committee Stage. The Senator made some important points regarding the use of the term "harm or offence". My officials are consulting the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regarding the existing practical operation of this provision. It will be important that any amendment that may be brought forward does not have unintended effects. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept these amendments. Regarding amendment No. 77, the language in the Bill and extant Broadcasting Act reflects Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Given that the fundamental right to freedom of expression flows from both our Constitution and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European Convention on Human Rights, there is a high bar for any steps that the State may take to limit freedom of expression. As I set out on Committee Stage, while Article 40.6 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it requires that right to be qualified in certain instances. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. As I set out on Committee Stage, while I understand the intention of amendment No. 78, I do not think that section 46L(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, needs to be qualified in the manner suggested by the amendment. The language used in the section reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act which has not to date exercised a chilling effect on broadcast journalism. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. On the commercial communications for gambling, given that the gambling authority of Ireland to be established by the gambling regulation Bill will issue codes in respect of advertising, including in relation to online gambling, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 80, 93 or 109. On the issue of speculative financial activities, I note that the Central Bank of Ireland regulates the advertising of financial activities by financial services firms under its remit. The rules are set out in the consumer protection code published by the Central Bank. Finally, as regards crypto-assets, I note that the EU markets in crypto-assets regulation is currently under negotiation in Brussels and will set out a regulatory framework for those assets. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 81, 94 or 110.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for his amendment. As I set out on Committee Stage, I acknowledge that the use of the term "party political programme" rather than "party political broadcast", may give rise to some interpretative confusion if it is not clarified. In the Bill as initiated, the term "party political programme" was used instead of "party political broadcast" to ensure that the relevant sections covered both broadcasting services and video-on-demand services. Following the Committee Stage debate on the matter, I asked my officials to examine the issue further and to consult the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. This question will be subject to further examination over the summer with a view to bringing a Committee Stage amendment to the Bill in the Dáil if it is determined that one is required. Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Sherlock for bringing forward amendment No. 84 today. I acknowledge the work she is doing in this area, including the recent publication of a Bill last week. I will address the first point of the amendment setting out that broadcast programmes should reflect the participation and be responsive to the interests of all groups. I have sought to address this issue as broadly as possible through amendment No. 11, which requires Coimisiún na Meán to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland with regard to its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services. I am absolutely committed to supporting diversity, inclusion and the full and effective participation of women across sectors for which my Department is responsible. I agree with the intention underpinning amendment No. 84 regarding the equal participation of men and women on news and current affairs shows. If we are to use media service codes as the mechanism to achieve broadly equal participation, however, we may need to provide more detail within the Bill to guide an coimisiún in making codes. Provision may need to be made to specify what happens, for example, when there are an uneven number of guests. I have asked my officials to explore this matter further over the summer recess. As to the final point of amendment No. 84 relating to airplay quotas for women, artists and composers, I would like to continue to examine the issue further. I would caution, as I did on Committee Stage, that quotas based on the residence or citizenship of an artist are not permissible under EU law. Airplay quotas based on gender may be permissible under EU law, but without a residence criterion, simply introducing gender-based quotas may lead to unintended effects. Again, I have asked my officials to examine this issue further during the summer recess. I want to finish discussing amendment No. 84 by thanking Senator Sherlock for highlighting Why Not Her? for publishing the recent gender disparity data report 2022. It is evident from the data that while there has been improvement across a number of radio stations, more needs to be done to promote and safeguard women's voices on air. I thank the Senator for the other amendments. As I stated on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 86. The principles and policies set out in section 46N of the Broadcasting Act, as amended, must reflect the need that audiences are protected from harmful or offensive content being broadcast as this is an important consideration in making media service codes. I understand the point the Senator is making in looking at the issue more generally in the context of amendments Nos. 75 and 76, which concern a proposal by the Senators to amend similar wording regarding the duties of broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services. As I stated on Committee Stage, I am advised that the proposed wording of amendment No. 87 seems to broadly achieve the same effect as the wording currently in the Bill. Therefore, I reject the amendment on that basis. Having further considered the matter, I am advised that the provision in amendment No. 88 could not be interpreted as to preclude the provision of programme material related to sexual conduct for educational purposes, particularly on important topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 address an issue raised by a number of Senators to explicitly provide for specific matters concerning commercial communications, which Coimisiún na Meán may regulate through media service codes, including in relation to infant and follow-on formula. I commend the quality of the debate on this issue during Committee Stage and assure Senators that I have given this matter due consideration. As Senators are aware, the Bill as published conferred broad powers on an coimisiún to regulate commercial communications on video-on-demand and broadcasting services through media service codes. In particular, section 46N(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended, by the Bill, as initiated, sets out that an coimisiún may make media service codes, which may provide for standards and practices to ensure:(d) that commercial communications—(i) protect the interests of the audience, and(ii) in particular, where they relate to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children, protect the interests of children having particular regard to the general public health interests of children. Subsection (5) of section 46N of the Act further specifies that an coimisiún may prohibit commercial communications "relating to foods or beverages considered by the Commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular those foods or beverages which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars." Amendment No. 89 is intended to clarify the language in subsection (5) of section 46N by providing that an coimisiún may not only prohibit but may "restrict, in accordance with law" the commercial communications referenced. Amendment No. 90 amends subsection (5) of section 46N by providing for a specific reference to infant and follow-on formula. It should be emphasised that an coimisiún would already be provided with this authority through the general powers that will be invested in it to make media service codes in respect of advertising. The language in section 46N(5) is based on the language used in section 42(4) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides for the power of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to make broadcasting codes. As I set out on Committee Stage, those broadcasting codes will remain in force until amended or replaced by media service codes. The current broadcasting code relating to commercial communications, the general commercial communications code states “Commercial communications for infant formula for use by infants during the first 6 months of life are prohibited.” This reflects EU law which sets out a number of rules regarding how infant and follow-on formula may or may not be advertised or otherwise marketed, and which is primarily enforced in Ireland by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Accordingly, my amendments primarily clarify already inherent powers of an coimisiún as regards infant and follow-on formula. Following an extensive Committee Stage debate in the Seanad and the very good points raised by Senators, I was convinced of the merits of making this power explicit. Finally, the issues raised by amendment No. 91 are addressed by the Government's amendments in this grouping.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the query raised by Senator Higgins, following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the language will not only prohibit but may also restrict and it is in line with the commission's general powers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said on Committee Stage, conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice, which is why the programme for Government includes a commitment to legislate to ban its practice. As Senators will be aware, my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is leading this initiative. I understand how distressing it can be for LGBTI+ people to encounter advertisements for conversion therapy. Following the commitment I gave on Committee Stage to considering the matter, my officials have been engaging with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure that both the practice and the advertisement of conversion therapy will be prohibited when legislation is brought forward. It is vital any legislation we bring forward be sufficiently robust to achieve its objective and, in particular, that we arrive at a legal definition of conversion therapy that is sufficient to capture the practice we all agree should be banned. An incomplete or insufficient definition of conversion therapy carries with it two risks. First, a definition may not be sufficiently expansive to capture completely all the incidences of what is a harmful practice to many people. Second, it may be drafted such that it may be construed incorrectly and may inadvertently capture, or be claimed or seen to capture, forms of gender-affirming care. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments. Nevertheless, I commit to ensuring the advertisement of conversion therapy will be prohibited when the practice itself is banned to ensure that any prohibitions and bans brought forward will be fully aligned. I have asked my officials to continue to engage with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As we discussed on Committee Stage, I do not see the rationale for setting a time period in legislation for public consultation on a media service code or rule. Given the principles underpinning the establishment of coimisiún na meán, I do not anticipate an coimisiún running a time-constrained public consultation process to deliberately avoid scrutiny. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 97 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding inserting a time period within which an coimisiún would be required to notify a complainant when his or her complaint was referred to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service or was dismissed. The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to notify a complainant within 30 days of any referral of his or her complaint to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service or of the dismissal of that complaint.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have addressed the intention of amendment No. 98 as regards commercial communications in respect of food through amendment No. 105, which will be discussed later. As regards the references to gambling, alcohol and weapons, I note that the gambling regulation Bill will regulate the advertisement of gambling, that alcohol advertising is regulated under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, and that the Bill as published already provides for an coimisiún to create online safety codes to ensure "that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children". I do not propose to accept the amendment. Regarding amendment No. 112, I note once again the Bill as initiated provides broad authority to an coimisiún to regulate commercial communications through online safety codes. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 99 would amend section 139E of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill, which relates to the process for designating online services for regulation and the matters which an coimisiún shall have regard to when deciding to make a designation. As I stated on Committee Stage, I do not see the relevance of inserting a reference to an individual UN convention in this context and accordingly I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We had a respectful debate on this matter on Committee Stage. As I said then, we both agree that an coimisiún must be conferred with robust and proportionate powers of investigation and compliance in order to discharge its functions effectively. This is particularly important when we are considering compliance with online safety codes addressing harmful online content. As I said on Committee Stage, I respect the intention of the Senator's amendment, but my advice remains the same. I cannot accept the amendments for the reasons we discussed on Committee Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As regards amendment No. 102, it is important to acknowledge that there is a very real issue with young children accessing online services that were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue that I am particularly aware of, both as a parent of young children and as the chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety. In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids. This strategy is built upon three pillars focused on child protection in the online environment, digital empowerment and active participation. Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, including through age verification and age-appropriate design. In this regard, the commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the Digital Services Act, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments. The commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content. In order to facilitate age verification, the commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age-verification methods. I will be asking an coimisiún to look at this issue as a priority, particularly through engaging on the Better Internet for Kids strategy, to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. As regards amendment No. 128, as I said on Committee Stage, the content limitation notice provisions in the Bill apply to harmful online content and not age-inappropriate online content so as to limit the potential involvement of the an coimisiún in matters regarding individual pieces of content to only that content which is expressly deemed harmful under the Bill. I cannot accept either of the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment 105 and its consequential amendments Nos. 114 and 115 address an issue raised by a number of Senators to explicitly provide for specific matters concerning commercial communications that coimisiún na meán may regulate through online safety codes. I commend the quality of the debate on this issue on Committee Stage and assure Senators that I have given the matter due consideration. The amendments I have tabled explicitly provide coimisiún na meán with the power to prohibit or restrict through online safety codes commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered by the commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular infant formula, follow-on formula or foods or beverages that contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars. It is important to note that an coimisiún would already be provided with the general power under the Bill as initiated to regulate advertising of such matters through online service codes. This is contained in section 139K(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which states that online safety codes may make provision with a view to ensuring "that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children". I also note the amendment No. 105 is based on the language set out in section 46N, subsection (5) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which relates to media service codes. This is to ensure that the language used as regards commercial communications is consistent between media service codes and online safety codes.
 As regards amendment No. 105, it should be recognised that it does not directly prohibit or restrict commercial communications relating to any type of food or beverage. That will fundamentally be a decision that an coimisiún may take through the making of an online safety code following consultation, particularly with the relevant public health bodies, who will be best placed to advice an coimisiún on the relevant public health law and advice. Amendment No. 105 addresses the points raised via amendments Nos. 101 and 103. On amendment 104, I would note once again the Bill as initiated provides broad authority to an coimisiún to regulate commercial communications through online safety codes. On Committee Stage, I also noted that the advertisement of alcohol is primarily being addressed through the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, which contains strong measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising. Regarding Senator Black's question, amendment No. 105 provides that "an online safety code may prohibit or restrict, in accordance with law, the inclusion in programmes or user-generated content of commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered by the Commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children". Alcohol would probably be considered a matter of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 106 appears to be a reference to section 30 of the Data Protection Act 2018 regarding direct marketing profiling and microtargeting. The commencement of that section of the Act is a matter for the Minister for Justice.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the Digital Services Act, DSA, are complementary pieces of legislation. One of the key drivers of the Bill is the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive, AMSD, into Irish law. The implementation of the directive in respect of online services, specifically video-sharing platform services, is provided for under the regulatory framework for online safety in this Bill. In this regard, the AMSD is explicitly recognised by the DSA as a distinct and complementary law to the proposed regulation. In relation to the regulation of other online services, the Bill provides for a regulatory framework for online safety that is designed to be adaptable and responsive to changes in Irish and EU law. It is clear that further legislation, in addition to this Bill, will be necessary to ensure appropriate alignment of our regulatory systems with the proposed regulation, for both coimisiún na meán and other regulators. I note that the European Parliament held its final vote approving the DSA last Tuesday, 5 July. This paves the way for formal adoption by the Council in September of this year. Ireland will have until 1 January 2024 to ensure that provisions of the DSA are provided for and supported by Irish law where necessary. Of course, the obligations on very large online platforms and very large online search engines, which will be regulated by the European Commission, will apply earlier - four months after they have been designated as such by the Commission. The Government has already decided that coimisiún na meán, which is to be established through this Bill, will act as the primary regulator or digital services co-ordinator, DSC, under the DSA. The Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the DSC, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. As I said stated on Committee Stage, in establishing an coimisiún and setting out a regulatory framework for online safety and a robust and fair enforcement and investigation mechanism, this Bill is establishing the scaffolding and structures to support future and forthcoming legislation, including the Digital Services Act. In this regard, the Bill will assist in the implementation of the regulation and not hinder it. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment. Having listened to the Senator's contribution, it may be worth pointing out that private messaging services are not covered by the DSA.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are regulating for Ireland, not the whole of the EU, with regard to private messaging.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 123 and its consequential amendments Nos. 118 to 122, inclusive, address the matter raised by a number of Senators and explicitly provide for specific matters concerning commercial communications which Coimisiún na Meán may regulate through online safety codes. The purpose of these amendments is to give further effect to these matters by providing that coimisiún na meán may consult a public health authority before making any such provision in an online safety code. This mirrors the existing similar provision in section 46N on media service codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 124 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to publish any reports regarding the operation of online safety codes it provides to the Minister on its website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 127 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to publish any rules it may make regarding the conduct of investigations by authorised officers on its website. I note that these particular rules would, in any case, be made by statutory instrument and published as a matter of course.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	For clarity, amendment No. 133 is included in this group but its proposers are not here. Should I still speak to it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 130 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane during Committee Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to provide that coimisiún na meán may fund, through a content production scheme made under section 159F of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill, new audiovisual programmes relating to biodiversity. Following the Seanad debate and the points raised by Senators, I thought there was merit in clarifying that it is intended that programmes related to biodiversity may funded through a scheme. The purpose of No. 131 is to change the reference in this provision from “human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion” to “human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion”. This is to address the point raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane during Seanad Committee Stage regarding consistency with other legislation which tends to refer to these human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion as distinctive concepts rather than treating them as a subset of human rights. On amendment No. 132, I noted during Committee Stage that I believe the general references to science and education in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill would already allow such programmes relating to digital empowerment and data protection awareness to be funded. I have not changed my position and will not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 133 provides that a content production scheme may be co-managed or delegated to another agency, and specifically references Screen Ireland in this regard. Given their complementary functions, I expect that coimisiún na meán and Screen Ireland will work closely together, in terms of both policy frameworks such as the audiovisual action plan and in terms of sharing information and knowledge regarding the operation of support schemes. However, I do not propose to accept this amendment as coimisiún na meán will include a media development commissioner whose remit will include the administration of any content production scheme. I welcome the intention of amendment No. 134, which would provide that an coimisiún shall have regard for the need to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in new audiovisual programmes funded by content production scheme. During Committee Stage I noted that I would be worried about specifying that any one group may imply that it should be prioritised for participation in a manner that implied other groups may not be. That is why I proposed amendment No. 11, which requires coimisiún na meán to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland in relation to its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services. This amendment is intended to include people with disabilities and ensure their further and adequate participation and representation. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 134. On Committee Stage, I indicated that I would give further consideration to amendment No. 135 in the context of Report Stage. I recognise the intention and would note that the Irish language element of the amendment may be adequately covered by the requirement that 25% of the annual funds of a content production scheme should be allocated to programmes in the Irish language. I recognise the importance of both adequate access rules and participation and representation in programmes for users of the Irish Sign Language. On access rules, section 46O of the Broadcasting Act as amended provides for an coimisiún to make media service rules requiring media service providers to make their services accessible, including provision of a sign language service. I also expect that amendment No. 11 will require an coimisiún to consider the participation and representation of users of Irish Sign Language as regards its policies. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe I did all of them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Did Deputy Chambers do one? He did. I had a family bereavement.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their kind words. This legislation is of such significance that it was worth every moment of the 30 hours we have spent discussing it. I thank the Oireachtas committee for its extensive pre-legislative scrutiny. This time last year it was seeking an extension to allow it more time, which I was happy to agree to because the legislation is so significant. Senator Carrigy has reminded me that I had a family bereavement during this process. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for stepping in for me that day. I thank all of the Senators here for what was a very constructive and respectful debate throughout. I thank them for that engagement. I also thank my officials, who must be exhausted. There was a lot of engagement with Senators outside of the Seanad and I thank the officials for doing that on my behalf. Gabhaim míle buíochas leo.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	It is a privilege for me to be elected by the constituents of Dublin Rathdown, but I am a proud Monaghan woman and I appreciate the reference to us as neighbours each time I come in. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teach as cuireadh a thabhairt dom bualadh libh chun plé a dhéanamh ar Thuarascáil um Choimisiún na Meán. A diverse, vibrant and independent media sector is essential for our democracy, cultural development and wider society. However, with technological advances, how we consume media has changed dramatically. This has had a profound impact on traditional broadcasting, in particular, and the media sector in general. These changed viewing habits, as well as falling print sales and the resultant move from traditional revenue streams to online advertising mean that media companies have had to alter their business models. More and more, competition is global rather than national. Beyond these commercial concerns, growing disinformation and misinformation challenges our democracy and our society, having the potential to undermine public confidence in news and information. The Government recognised this, and the programme for Government committed to the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media. The commission was tasked with making recommendations to Government to ensure the future funding of public service media is sustainable, ensures independent editorial oversight and delivers value for money to the public. The high level of interest shown in the work of the commission is a clear demonstration of how important the media sector is to society. The commission’s deliberations were informed by more than 800 public submissions, while more than 50 expert panellists took part in the online webinars along with 1,000 members of the public. The commission has fulfilled its remit to the highest standard and I am sure the Senators will join me in taking this opportunity to thank Professor Brian MacCraith and the commission members for their work in bringing this comprehensive report to fruition. The commission’s comprehensive and timely report details both the challenges and opportunities for media companies in Ireland. The recommendations contained in the report are a blueprint for the Government to now build a framework to support the media sector to face the challenges ahead, and to continue its vital role in educating, informing and entertaining the public. The Government accepted, in principle, 49 of the 50 recommendations made by the commission, which demonstrates how positively it was received. However, the Government was unable to accept the commission’s recommendation to move to a fully Exchequer-funded model. A key consideration in this regard was the need to ensure the continued independence of media and minimise even the perceived risk of political interference, which could arise in a situation where public service media was fully dependent on Exchequer funding.  The Government also believes that any new or reformed funding model should retain and build on the existing revenue stream from the direct sale of television, TV, licences, which provides an important direct link between broadcasters and the Irish public, to maintain a link between the creation and consumption of media content. Furthermore, given the many pressing demands on the Exchequer, I am sure the Senators will appreciate that this is not the time to impose an additional burden on Exchequer funding. However, the Government recognises the need to reform the TV licence model. A technical working group, led by my Department, has been set up and will report back to me in November on the practical steps that need to be taken to create a fairer, more efficient and more sustainable system. Both public service media and providers of public service content will benefit from the reform of the TV licence fee.A cornerstone of the Future of Media Commission’s report and recommendations is the establishment of a media commission, a new regulator with a wider remit to address the shift in media consumption. Such a new body, coimisiún na meán, is to be established under the provisions of the Online Safety and Media Regulation, OSMR, Bill 2022. The Bill will commence Second Stage next week in the Dáil, having been debated extensively in this House before the summer. I again thank Senators for their contributions and suggestions, many of which I was able to take on board on Committee Stage in the House. An coimisiún will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to implement the commission’s report and two of the initial commissioner roles will play a significant role in delivering on the Government’s implementation of the Future of Media Commission report, the broadcasting commissioner and the media development commissioner. During the summer, the positions of executive chairperson, media development commissioner and online safety commissioner, were advertised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, through public competitions. The appointment processes are continuing. In addition, the current CEO of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, will act as the interim broadcasting commissioner in coimisiún na meán.  Tectonic shifts in how media is produced and consumed mean that a media regulator cannot restrict itself to broadcasting; it must regulate and support the entire media sector and it must act with a sense of urgency. I secured funding for this year to support the establishment of an coimisiún so that it could hit the ground running. I am sure that Senators will agree that the broadcasting fund and the sound and vision scheme, which are operated by the BAI, have been successful in the creation of high-quality audiovisual content. While it is primarily funded through the proceeds of TV licence receipts, I was delighted to secure significant additional Exchequer funds to increase support to the sector during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was also pleased to announce in May a further €10.5 million in additional funding for 2022. Some €5 million of this has been assigned for a special round of the sound and vision scheme, which will create programming related to climate change and climate action, and is being co-funded by my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. A sum of €2 million has been earmarked for Irish language programming, €2 million for live music programming and a further €1.5 million has been assigned to general sound and vision programming. Notwithstanding this, I welcome the Future of Media Commission’s recommendation to significantly enhance the existing broadcasting fund, an expansion to a platform-neutral media fund. The BAI will commence work on the design of the new schemes, and of the six recommended schemes, I have prioritised those for local democracy reporting and court reporting. I expect that coimisiún na meán will be in a position to commence roll-out of these schemes in 2023. The planned schemes have the potential to be transformative for local and regional media, including the print sector. The local democracy reporting scheme will help local media keep the public informed on areas such as regional health forums, joint policing committees and local authorities, among other areas. I agree with the commission that is it essential to support local media to provide comprehensive coverage of issues related to local democracy and to provide additional supports for counties with Gaeltachtaí. Likewise, the courts reporting scheme will enable improved reporting from local, regional and national courts. Comprehensive, professional and publicly accessible reports of court proceedings are integral to our democratic process. While I have set out the priorities in this regard, other planned schemes will also play a significant role in supporting our media to meet the challenges they face. The digital transformation scheme will help traditional media adapt to the changing media landscape, while the access and training scheme will develop internships, bursaries, and diversity training opportunities for both new and existing staff. Senators will also appreciate how important it is to cover news that has high public interest but that is in danger of being under-reported and the proposed news reporting scheme will support the provision of news on topics we all care deeply about, such as the environment, equality and diversity.  I am sure that the Senators are as committed as I am to our national broadcaster. RTÉ is continuing to serve the public well. This was never so apparent and necessary as during the dark days of Covid-19 restrictions, when RTÉ played a very important role, together with other media, in keeping our people informed with reliable and trustworthy news. I welcome the commission’s recommendation that RTÉ develops a strategic capital asset management plan. This will help the organisation to optimise its use of available resources in the medium and long term. I also agree with the commission that RTÉ needs to complete its digital transformation by investing more in technology, particularly streaming services, such as the RTÉ Player. Through strategic planning, digital innovation, and the support of organisations like NewERA and coimisiún na meán, the organisation can build on its strengths as a key public service broadcaster. The commission proposed that during the interim period of 2021-23, RTÉ, TG4 and the broadcasting fund should receive additional investment. The Government will now look again at the funding levels that were proposed, taking into account changes in the financial position and economic climate since the commission made its assessments. Funding decisions will need to be considered in the context of the ongoing budget and Estimates processes, and the competing demands on the Exchequer. Like the commission, I applaud TG4 for its high-quality and innovative Irish language programming, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, with initiatives such as Cúla4 ar Scoil for families and teachers who were homeschooling. As a mother and a former teacher, I appreciate how important this initiative was and I was pleased to be able to provide supplementary funding of €1.9 million to TG4 in 2020 towards Covid-19 related costs. I also provided another €3.5 million in budget 2021 and €4.2 million in budget 2022 to TG4, with this year’s increase being the single largest increase provided to TG4. This has supported it so it can continue to develop high-quality content, increase its reach and support the Irish language creative sector. Tugaim tús áite, ar leibhéal pearsanta agus mar Aire le freagracht as an nGaeltacht agus as an nGaeilge, do chur chun cinn agus forbairt na teanga. Tuigim go maith an ról tábhachtach atá ag na meáin chun freastal ar riachtanais agus mianta chainteoirí Gaeilge, chun cabhrú le daoine ar mhaith leo labhairt na Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus chun straitéis 20 bliain an Rialtais don Ghaeilge a sheachadadh. I very much support the commission’s recommendation that coimisiún na meán conduct a comprehensive review of Irish language provision, looking at the roles of TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta, RTÉ and other content providers. We need to avoid duplications and find synergies and to attract new audiences. Irish language broadcasting is a priority for the BAI, and the sound and vision scheme already allocates a quarter of its funding to Irish language projects. New media fund schemes will also be accessible to Irish language projects. The local democracy reporting scheme and the community media scheme should be of particular interest to Irish language media. The commission’s report details the challenges the print sector faces in Ireland and how deeply the commission consulted with the industry. National, regional and local newspapers will benefit from the expanded media fund. The radio sector will also have much to gain, both from the widening of the sound and vision scheme to support news content and from new media fund schemes, such as the media access and training scheme, the community media scheme and digital transformation scheme. A diversity and inclusion strategy for sports reporting and broadcasting will also be developed, as coimisiún na meán and Sport Ireland develop a strategic plan for sports broadcasting. We must showcase more sports across multiple platforms and work together to create a more active population. Another area in which many organisations will need to work together to achieve a common aim is the fight against disinformation. I completely agree with the commission’s recommendation that we need to develop a national counter-disinformation strategy to explore how to combat the growing problem of disinformation. My Department will lead on the development of such a strategy in the coming months, in conjunction with the Tánaiste’s Department, which is overseeing the Digital Services Act. More generally, coimisiún na meán will promote sustainability in broadcast, print and online media by setting sustainability standards for media fund schemes. The BAI’s existing sustainability network will be expanded to include all of the sector. Gender equality standards have shown themselves to be highly effective under the sound and vision scheme. In the most recent round, more than 50% of TV funding went to projects in which half or more of the key production roles are filled by women.However, I agree with the commission’s recommendation that we go further in addressing equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, not only in the content the sector provides but within the media sector itself. The recommendations on EDI standards, increased research and auditing and the establishment of diversity boards will all play a part in ensuring the sector is a true reflection of our society today. The Future of Media Commission report is a comprehensive document with far-reaching recommendations. I look forward to hearing Members’ thoughts and contributions. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as a gcuid ama inniu.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators for their contributions today. In closing I will try to address as many of the specific matters raised as possible. Forgive me if I do not get to touch upon all the Senators' contributions. Regarding the funding of public service media, as mentioned by all who contributed today in the House, I am sure Members agree that maintaining the independence of the media is vitally important. The Government believes that if it were to directly provide the full funding of our public service media providers, questions might arise - that is the Government's opinion - as to the media's independence from Government. We have carefully considered how best to reform the television licence collection and as the commission itself stated, no funding model is without its challenges. We recognise that the television licence as it currently stands needs an overhaul and does not reflect the way we now consume broadcast content. We also believe that any funding model should retain and build on the existing revenue stream from the direct sale of television licences, which provides an important direct link between broadcasters and the Irish public and which has underpinned the independence of the broadcasting sector. A technical working group chaired by my Department has started work on the reform of the television licence model from the question of liability to pay to collection and enforcement. It is examining these issues in detail and will report back to me in November. I offered the terms of reference to the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media yesterday. I am quite happy to give Senator Sherlock and the members of the committee the detailed terms of reference. I have faith in the working group to do the job and task that has been assigned to it. It will report back to me in November. Of course, that brings us to the question of implementation. While we all wish to see the necessary changes begin as soon as possible in accepting the report's recommendations in principle, the Government is conscious that some time has passed since the commission developed its conclusions. We must, therefore, take some time to reassess the timeline for implementation. The economic climate has changed and we must also have in place a regulatory and development framework. This has been put in place in coimisiún na meán. The implementation of the far-reaching recommendations of the commission will require changes to legislation, regulation and funding. It will also require the co-ordination of various Departments, agencies and external stakeholders. The Government has set up an implementation group, which has started work on developing a detailed implementation strategy. This group will also report to me in November. The community scheme, which was raised by Senator Warfield, will provide funds for training, media literacy and community projects. It will aim to enhance the links between community media and higher and further education and support the establishment of community media hubs. With regard to his query on Saorview, RTÉ is mandated to maintain the network. I do not envisage any change in that. I agree with Senator Warfield that Saorview serves us well, particularly in rural areas. Three key recommendations of the commission were to enhance the exploitation of intellectual property rights, channel a content levy into the creator sector and expand section 4 for tax reliefs to include broadcasters. The implementation group will examine that. On the issue of supports for the wider sector, the Government has already voiced its support for the commission's recommendation to establish a platform-neutral media fund. Priorities have been set out to establish the courts reporting scheme and the local democracy scheme in 2023. In response to Senator Sherlock, I believe that over time, the six recommended funding schemes will provide a full suite of support to the entire sector. We can all agree that the print sector still plays a crucial role in Ireland. The problems currently faced by the print sector are well documented. Declining newspaper regulation figures, falling revenues from advertising and the rise of big tech have all combined to place the newspaper industry under increasing pressure. I will meet representatives of NewsBrands Ireland next week. With regard to the 0% VAT rate, I am in budgetary negotiations with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, whose remit is in that area. The expanded media fund will provide a support base for newspapers and, in particular, local titles. This will assist not only with content but with digital transformation and training and access. I completely agree with the commission, as well as many Members of the House, that radio is an essential part of the media landscape in Ireland. Joint national listenership research, JNLR, data show that four in five people in Ireland listen to the radio every day, tuning into international, local and community stations. The vital role played by radio was clearly shown during the Covid-19 pandemic. Radio stations are trusted sources of information and were a vital means of informing listeners of the threats posed by Covid-19 and how to deal with them. I thank the commission for its practical recommendations on supporting the radio sector, enhancing the sound and vision scheme to allow the funding of news and current affairs and introducing new schemes such as that to support community media. They are particularly important. In addition, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will enable radio stations to earn more income through changes to advertising. Senator Warfield mentioned RTÉ's financial stability. The New Economy and Recovery Authority, NewERA, and my Department will continue to engage with RTÉ on its commitment to deliver savings and efficiencies. Under the revised strategy for 2020 to 2024, the Future of Media Commission also sees an enhanced role for Coimisiún na Meán in setting targets for RTÉ and monitoring how well RTÉ achieves these targets. I have already addressed our commitment to reforming the public funding model. However, the commission's recommended interim funding for RTÉ will have to be addressed in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations and the competing priorities the Government must balance. I have demonstrated my commitment to Irish language broadcasting by providing TG4 with its biggest ever annual increase in funding of €4.2 million in 2022, bringing its allocation to €44.9 million this year. As part of the annual Estimates and budgetary processes, I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to secure the funding to enable TG4 to continue to deliver on its ambitions. I also agree with the commission that TG4 should be designated as a NewERA body, which will enable TG4 to benefit from NewERA's financial management expertise. Like Senator Sherlock, I am very supportive of the promotion of gender balance, inclusion and diversity in our media, as are others in the Oireachtas. Senator Sherlock brought that particular issue up, however. We are making progress in gender equality but there are still many areas in which women are in the minority in Ireland, including on our airwaves. A refrain we often heard in the commission's thematic dialogues was "You have to see it to be it" and it is one with which I completely agree. We need to see more women on screen and on air and more women behind the scenes also. Minorities and people with disabilities must also become much more prominent in a diverse media landscape that should reflect the wonderful diversity of our society. I trust Senators will agree with me that Coimisiún na Meán should play an even greater role in creating and enforcing EDI standards across the media industry. I support the commission's call on media organisations to create diversity boards and media lead roles to promote diversity and equality. I acknowledge Senator Carrigy has a particular interest in this and Senators will see the merit in calling on media organisations to use new media fund schemes to assist in the broadcasting of minority sports.The transmission of sporting events, like so much else in the media industry, is undergoing rapid change. The national sports policy 2018 to 2027 highlighted the need to create a more active population. I endorse the commission’s suggestion that public service media should be used in the promotion of sports that tie in with this policy, such as swimming, running and cycling. The commission met with many experts in the field of culture and the creative economy. It applauded the great strides that Ireland had made in this regard and the opportunity to achieve even more. With a relatively small home market, the commission is correct in highlighting the need for Ireland to punch above its weight and to take advantage of international opportunities. The implementation group will work with other Departments and stakeholders to explore how best to achieve this.  Alongside the seismic shifts in media, the commission noted the troubling growth in misinformation and disinformation. We are fortunate that the commission contained a number of members who are experts in this field. My Department will lead on this in the coming months in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is overseeing the transposition of the Digital Services Act. We will also work with the Irish hub of the European Digital Media Observatory, news organisations, industry stakeholders, civil society groups, Irish fact checkers and disinformation researchers.  Regarding Senator Garvey's contribution on sustainability, I agree with the commission that media must champion sustainability throughout our society while, at the same time, adopting more sustainable approaches to programming and content. The media sector must lead by example in this area.  Let me end with the first recommendation of the commission, which is that media should be recognised as a “merit good”. As Professor Brian MacCraith said at the launch of the report in July, public service content "should be recognised as a “merit good” that delivers valued benefits to society and the democratic system, and, as such, represents critical public infrastructure". As the Minister with responsibility for the media, I understand that without a healthy media we cannot enjoy a healthy society and a functioning democracy. The commission has clearly established that high-quality, independent journalism and a pluralistic media system is vital. We have a media system that has served this country well. However, we cannot take it for granted. The sector needs to adapt to rapidly evolving technology and changing consumer needs and we as a Government must also respond to these transformations. I look forward to working across government and with the media sector to ensure that together we achieve our shared ambition. I thank the Seanad for the opportunity to discuss the report.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Is mór on onóir dom a bheidh anseo inniu. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as cuireadh a thabhairt dom teacht chuig Seanad Éireann inniu. Tá sé go hiontach an deis a fháil léargas a thabhairt don Teach ar an gclár Sábháilte le Cruthú. I am very pleased that the Members of Seanad Éireann are engaging with this crucially important initiative, Safe to Create, which is a new programme for the arts and culture sector that I launched last month. Safe to Create is a dignity at work programme. It is the culmination of our work to date on dignity at work, led by programmes such as Speak Up and Call it Out, Speak Up: A Call for Change, and Minding Creative Minds. I emphasise that this is our work to date because although we are at the cutting edge of action in this area, we are really only getting started. The aim of the Safe to Create programme is to transform culture and practices in the arts, culture and creative sector through raising awareness and providing training, information, voluntary compliance and certification in order that we can provide safer working conditions for artists and arts workers as well as providing key support for victims and survivors in the areas of reporting, counselling and legal advice. My Department works in partnership with the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Minding Creative Minds to deliver the Safe to Create programme. I provide annual funding to the Irish Theatre Institute and to Minding Creative Minds to deliver their services to the creative sector. The Safe to Create platform provides an effective, user-friendly, online dignity at work toolkit for organisations and individuals in the creative sector, including "know your rights" information for artists and arts workers; free counselling, legal assistance and a 24-7 helpline for artists and arts workers; resources for organisations including legislation, codes, policies and sample HR procedures and templates; a code of behaviour and dignity at work trust statement; Sign the Code, which is an online register for organisations and individuals to formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to implement it; and training to address dignity at work issues.Safe to Create is available to all individuals and organisations in the Irish arts and creative sector. I encourage Senators to explore the website, www.safetocreate.ie, and view the range of information, training and resources. The website, like the programme itself, is evolving as additional information, services and resources are added. The Safe to Create programme emerged from the Irish Theatre Institute’s Speak Up initiative. In 2021, I engaged the Irish Theatre Institute to carry out an anonymous survey which attracted over 1,300 respondents. A year ago, the findings of the survey were published under the title Speak Up: A Call for Change, along with a set of recommendations. The report’s stark findings confirmed that there was a culture of harmful workplace behaviour throughout the Irish arts sector and a worrying lack of supports to tackle this issue. When I launched the Speak Up: A Call for Change report last year, I assured all of the respondents to the survey that their voices had been heard. The Safe to Create programme is built on and informed by the findings and recommendations in the Speak Up report, and particularly on the areas where artists and arts workers said they needed change and support. With the Safe to Create programme, we in the arts are leading the way in improving and transforming damaging norms for the benefit of all in the creative sector. Together we can ensure creative spaces are safe and that those working in the sector are treated with dignity and respect. I am pleased to have secured additional funding of up to €500,000 in budget 2023 for the Safe to Create programme. The planned supports will include the resource-rich website featuring practical information, guidance, toolkits and templates for artists, arts workers and organisations regarding dignity at work rights and responsibilities and the well-being and support service provided by Minding Creative Minds for victims of harmful behaviours, including one-on-one counselling, access to legal advice and a 24-hour trauma helpline. The supports also include the training programme that has been developed specifically for the arts and creative sectors on dignity at work issues. It includes the topics of tackling bullying and harassment, and addressing unconscious bias. The training programme also includes bystander training and intimacy training that has been created in partnership with Screen Ireland. The code of behaviour that organisations are asked to adopt is an important element of this programme. It has been developed to help enable arts and creative organisations to create workplaces free from bullying, harassment and intimidation of any kind and to reassure artists and arts workers that their employers are publicly adopting the code. The code is on the Safe to Create website, along with a register that organisations and individuals can formally sign. The aim is to embed this industry-wide code of behaviour in the sector to do the following: proactively encourage a zero-tolerance attitude to all of the negative behaviours; commit to investigate complaints in a timely fashion; raise awareness of what constitutes damaging behaviour; and encourage all workers to undertake training. There are workshop roadshows called "Code on the Road" currently happening throughout the country to provide information for individuals and support for organisations to utilise and implement the Safe to Create supports and code of behaviour. The first Code on the Road took place in Cork last week. Report to Support is an anonymous reporting system designed to provide a facility for those working in the arts and creative sectors to report incidents of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment without the need to identify themselves or disclose sensitive and personal details. Information collected via the Report to Support pilot will be aggregated twice annually and will be used to inform the development and delivery of additional dignity at work supports such as training, policies, legal supports and counselling. This information will also inform the new research planned for 2023 and beyond. The Safe to Create website has information on steps individuals can take to make a formal or informal complaint on individual experiences. A research programme of further study will examine the prevalence and impact of harmful behaviours in Ireland’s arts sector and measure the impact of the Safe to Create programme. The lead researcher is currently undergoing an analysis of methodologies to use that would be more inclusive of the intersectionality of ethnicity, disability, sexuality and how it influences harm within and across Ireland’s arts sector. Monitoring and compliance will be led by funding bodies, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, and by my Department. Organisations found not to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams. The Arts Council is introducing a condition that all funded organisations must adopt and implement the Safe to Create code of behaviour and undertake relevant online Safe to Create training. Screen Ireland similarly requires full legal compliance with all health and safety in the workplace and employment legislation. In addition, it requires funding recipients to maintain dignity at work policies that include appropriate action and grievance procedures to address employee complaints. In the coming months, my Department and the Irish Theatre Institute will be working in partnership to implement and promote these supports, to monitor the impact of measures taken and to collaborate with appropriate agencies to build effective monitoring, accountability and oversight mechanisms for harmful behaviour in the workplace in the arts sector in Ireland.  Since becoming Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I have recognised the importance of well-being for the creative sector. Minding Creative Minds is a free 24-7 mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and includes access to advice, counselling, legal advice, assistance, financial and budgeting advice, career guidance and life coaching and mediation. Minding Creative Minds has recently enhanced its services to include specialist trauma and abuse counselling care and support for victims of serious trauma and sexual abuse, in association with Spectrum Life. With additional funding provided by my Department, Minding Creative Minds also plans to provide access to new therapies in 2023 in addition to the mental health and ancillary supports it already offers. It also plans to develop and roll out a specific app for the creative sector that will readily enable users of the 24-7 well-being service to contact or chat with a qualified counsellor or psychotherapist. In addition, it aims to further expand its mentoring programme which has proved very successful, having provided 500 career mentoring hours to date. The Safe to Create programme is a step on the road to transforming workplace culture and practices and to providing safe and respectful working conditions for those working in the arts. However, we know that harmful behaviours are not confined to the arts sector. In order to enact real change, cross-governmental co-operation is required. That is why my Department has been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice. The third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was launched on 28 June by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee. The strategy incorporates the implementation of the Safe to Create programme, which is listed in the implementation plan. This third national strategy will cost €363 million and is built on the four pillars of the Istanbul Convention framework. The accompanying implementation plan contains 144 detailed actions for implementation this year and next year. This implementation will be ensured by strong oversight and co-ordination at central government level. A key element of delivering on the goal of the strategy is the establishment of a statutory domestic, sexual and gender-based violence agency under the aegis of the Department of Justice. This agency, to be set up in law, will be tasked with co-ordinating all Government actions set out in this third national strategy. As Minister, I ask all parties in the arts, culture and creative sectors to engage with Safe to Create. Organisations sign the code and demonstrate the sector-wide desire to make our workplaces safer. I encourage everyone working in the sector at every level, including employees, the self-employed and those on boards, to undertake, and get certified as having completed, three free online training courses, specifically those on addressing unconscious bias, tackling bullying and harassment at work, and bystander training. Before I conclude, I will acknowledge the efforts of the stakeholders involved who worked closely with my Department to make the Safe to Create programme happen, namely, the Irish Theatre Institute, Minding Creative Minds, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland. There was also constructive engagement from FairPlé. Also of note is the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, entitled A Safe and Respectful Working Environment in the Arts. It is closely aligned with the Irish Theatre Institute's Speak Up report and most of its 11 recommendations are being, or will be, addressed by the Safe to Create programme. I sincerely thank the committee for its support and engagement on this important issue. I particularly thank the individuals who responded to the Speak Up survey.Their courage reminds me of the Jane Austen quote:There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me. Let me say to those who responded, it is their courage that has brought about positive change for the entire creative sector. From the outset, as Minister responsible for the arts, I wanted to send out a clear message that dignity in the workplace is the right of every artist and arts worker. While we know that these issues are not confined to the arts sector, through the Safe to Create programme we are working hard to change damaging behaviours. During this process I have heard first-hand that people have been suffering great trauma and harm. Inaction is inexcusable and I hope that this extensive programme of supports will encourage other sectors to follow suit.  As the old Irish proverb goes, anáil na beatha an t-athrú, that is, change is the breath of life. Tá sé tábhachtach go dtapóimid an deis seo anois le hathruithe a chur i bhfeidhm chun áit shábháilte oibre a chinntiú dóibh siúd ar fad atá ag obair in earnáil na n-ealaíon in Éirinn, anois agus sna blianta amach romhainn..
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I begin my concluding remarks by thanking Senators for raising this matter for discussion. I welcome the opportunity to speak to Members and to hear their contributions on this important issue. Since I became Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I have striven to bring about positive change. The arts is an area that has always held a special place in my heart. I am pleased that in my time in the Department I have managed to bring about change that I hope is of value to those who work in this area. In the case of the Safe to Create programme, it is not just of value as the changes are so badly needed. As Senator Black said, she was lucky. We are very proud to have her in the Seanad. She is such an accomplished singer, as are others in her family. It should not just be a case of being lucky, it should be the norm and the standard. If we are a country that is so proud of our artists, they should feel safe in their workplace. I hope this will help to deliver that safety. I will go through the contributions of Senators before I sum up. Senator Martin spoke first. I am glad that he placed emphasis on the signing of the code, because that is a key part of the delivery of the programme. The proposals for research in 2023 have already been received by my Department. As Senator Warfield said, the research must be ongoing. It is not just a case of doing it once, it must be a continuing process. I thank Senator Clonan for raising the important issue of disability. I am fully aware of the issue. His contribution was based on his lived experience and was very eloquent and heartfelt. I also have met Emilie Conway. She is an inspiring person. My Department and the Arts Council are engaging with officials in the Department of Social Protection and I have also made representations to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, on foot of the meeting with Emilie. Although this issue is primarily one for the Minister for Social Protection, it is my goal to support all artists in every way possible. We will continue that engagement. I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for the work he did on the committee to inform this important subject. When the report was launched, Members mentioned that Senator Warfield in particular drove it. I commend him on putting the issue centre stage. That was recognised by the members of the committee. I like the idea Senator Malcolm Byrne had about mentors and leaders in this area. I fully agree with what he said about organisations that do step up and adopt the code. He will find that any organisation will find cold comfort the next time it applies for funding if it has not signed up. I am delighted that Senator Kyne visited the Safe to Create website. I will pass his kind comments to the Irish Theatre Institute. The Code on the Road workshop is in Galway today. It will be in the Clarence Hotel in Dublin this Friday and Sligo next Monday. I can inform Senator Maria Byrne that it was in Cork last week so it has been to the south.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senator Kyne asked if it will continue. It is our intention that the Code on the Road workshops will continue next year. It will be expected that the boards of organisations would formally adopt the code. Next month we hope to be able to publish an initial tranche of early adoptees of the code. I reiterate Senator Warfield's thanks to the 1,300 brave people who responded to the survey that informs the actions outlined today and to the many people who have spoken out in recent years. They have been so courageous in speaking of their personal trauma in an effort to change it. The work of the committee, my officials, the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council and fantastic organisations such as Mise Fosta and Fair Plé, which have engaged, are changing the situation for the better. I acknowledge that it was difficult and brave for those individuals to speak up. In response to Senators Black and Warfield, the Speak Up report referred to the lack of accountability for organisations perpetrating or covering up harmful work behaviours, and the Senators asked what kind of accountability I am putting in place to ensure they do not receive State funding. The majority of funding to the arts sector is done through the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions. Both the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are leading on this by modifying their conditions of funding so that organisations that are found not to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will disqualify themselves from future funding streams. That is the key action that may make people stand to attention. All employers and organisations in the sector are being encouraged to adopt the code. My Department officials are also in discussion with colleagues in government, including the Department of Justice, particularly on the third national strategy. To return to the programme itself, as I have already outlined, the plan supports that Safe to Create platform. I encourage Senators to spread the word about it. The web address is safetocreate.ie. The well-being and support service provided by Minding Creative Minds is free and provides valuable advice, counselling, legal advice and a 24-hour trauma helpline. I urge Senators to tell everyone in the arts sector that this is here and it is free. It is a free and invaluable service. Based on our engagement with the sector, this is what they needed and wanted. On a training programme developed specifically for the arts and creative sectors on dignity at work issues, all the courses are free and online. On the code of behaviour I mentioned, the Code on the Road workshop roadshows, more research is key to keeping this up to date and to ensuring all the actions reflect what is needed as well as the monitoring and compliance. Since its launch on 5 October, the Safe to Create team has been working to embed dignity at work everywhere in the sector. For example, Ireland Music Week made the code of behaviour the pledge of its festival in October. This was valuable marketing to raise awareness of Safe to Create in the music sector. The Irish Theatre Institute was invited to speak about the Safe to Create programme at Theatre Forum's Tomorrow Together conference in Cork. The Arts Council has arranged an art form resource organisation meeting on 22 November, and the Irish Theatre Institute will present to that meeting about Safe to Create. The Arts Council is also looking at organising other Safe to Create meetings for its funded bodies in the first half of 2023. In the coming months, my Department and the Irish Theatre Institute will be working with its partners to implement and promote these supports to monitor the impact of measures taken and to collaborate with the appropriate agencies to build effective monitoring, accountability and oversight mechanisms for harmful behaviour in the workplace in the arts sector in Ireland. I thank Senators for their contributions. I return to the brave people who made this change happen, those who work in the sector. Those contributions have been the catalyst of change the arts sector very much needed. I remind organisations to sign the code and individuals to do the training courses. The three dignity at work courses take about an hour each. We have made great progress, but this is the start of a journey that was badly needed to be taken. There is a lot still to be done in the sector and in the programme, and I am absolutely committed to it.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas le baill an tSeanaid agus an chuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. The National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industrySection 24(1) of the National Tourism Development Act 2003 gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) limits the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of 2022. No further voted capital funding can then be advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I am bringing this Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. Before giving further details of the Bill, I pay tribute to those who form part of the tourism ecosystem and make an important contribution to Ireland's overall economic performance. I particularly recognise the way in which the tourism industry reaches across the country and its importance for the regional economy. The contribution of tourism is not confined to directly generated employment, economic activity and exports. The sector has an important multiplier effect on other employment sectors such as agriculture, transport, retail, food and beverage, which are particularly important to regional economies. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad and generating a positive impression of Irish people, our landscape and culture for visitors. Recent years have been challenging but I am confident that with all of those engaged with Irish tourism working together with the relevant agencies, Ministers and the Government, we can ensure the quality and competitiveness of the Irish tourist offering is continually improved and that the industry generates increased earnings and more jobs as part of our economic recovery. As with all industry, it is important that the tourism sector keeps innovating and developing in order to keep Ireland in the minds of potential travellers. In that regard, we know how important it is that brilliant visitor experiences, attractions and activities are available to visitors both international and domestic. As a significant proportion of tourists are drawn to attractions and participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland offers a range of supports to help tourism providers across the country to maximise their individual and collective offering in a way that attracts and engages tourists and enhances their overall experience. Ireland's tourism sector provides a wealth of opportunities for great offerings for visitors. In order to enhance those opportunities from a strategic perspective, Fáilte Ireland, broadly speaking, has four main funding channels for its capital investment in tourism product development. These are the large grants schemes provided under the platforms for growth approach, the small grants schemes, which are targeted schemes usually aligned with the tourism experience brands, strategic partnerships and other collaborations, and direct investment in experience brand infrastructure. In addition, part of Fáilte Ireland's capital funding programme uses platforms for growth to drive development in specific areas. The first platform for growth was launched in May 2019 and focused on developing immersive heritage and cultural attractions. These are attractions that appeal to overseas visitors looking for experiences that help them to connect with Ireland and bring the country's culture, heritage and people to life. Through this platform, Fáilte Ireland aims to ensure strong growth in development by investing in heritage and cultural attractions of scale that will motivate visitors to travel, either to and-or within Ireland, but without displacing the existing attractions of a destination or disturbing the competitiveness already attached to mature destinations. The overall objective is to deliver brilliant experiences that allow visitors to connect with Ireland and bring the national and local culture, heritage and people to life, while also delivering a greater regional and seasonal spread of tourism. In April last year, €19 million worth of investment was announced for the second platforms for growth strategy, to be used to develop world-class facility centres at 20 locations across the country at which water-based activities are a key visitor attraction. This includes locations such as Tipperary, Sligo and Leitrim, to name but a few. These facilities, designed to serve as a hub in each locality from which multiple water sports operators can base themselves, will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points. They will be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainability best practice such as solar heating panels. This sustainable tourism investment scheme was developed in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities. In addition to funding provided under the platforms for growth approach to large grants schemes, Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences in Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments. The strategic partnerships include entities such as Waterways Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Rural and Community Development. Fáilte Ireland supports a wide range of projects. This year alone, these have included projects in the Céide Fields in Mayo, the Blasket Islands in Kerry, Knowth in Meath and the National Famine Museum in Strokestown. From a tourism perspective, Fáilte Ireland's investment of €3.9 million is one of the largest ever investments in a visitor attraction in Ireland's Hidden Heartlands. There is a knock-on impact on the local economy both in terms of employment in attractions such as the National Famine Museum in Roscommon and in the wider tourism sector and economy. Fáilte Ireland's capital investment in tourism product development is further enhanced by complementary programme supports, including for festivals and events, business supports and training, and marketing and promotions, which are aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the overall visitor experience. The intention is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable tourism development through increasing the geographic spread of visitors. My Department has initiated the development of a new national sustainable tourism policy that seeks to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years to support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. The policy will seek to support sustainable development in communities throughout the country, while protecting our environment and natural resources and encouraging a greater spread of demand across the year. I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill. The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited and establish the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(1) of the Act gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine. Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises. However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process. This limit on total capital funding was originally set at €65 million but was later increased to €150 million and then €300 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Acts 2011 and 2016. Taking into account the 2022 capital allocation to Fáilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital projects is now approaching that limit. Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to Fáilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects. Accordingly, it is now prudent to legislate for an increase in the limit. Is trí eispéiris agus áiteanna turasóireachta a fhorbairt gur féidir linn tairbhe a bhaint as an bhfás domhanda sa turasóireacht agus a chinntiú go bhfaigheann Éire, agus gach réigiún di, a sciar de na buntáistí a chuireann turasóireacht ar fáil go sóisialta agus go heacnamaíoch. Déantar na tairiscintí seo a phacáistiú agus a chur chun cinn faoinár mbrandaí eispéireas turasóireachta den chéad scoth chun a chinntiú go seasann Éire amach sa mhargadh idirnáisiúnta. Cuirfidh an Bille seo ar chumas an fhorbairt seo leanúint ar aghaidh. I am introducing this Bill to make the necessary legislative change and I commend it to the House.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht seo agus a chuir a dtuairimí faoi fhorbairt earnáil turasóireachta na hÉireann in iúl. It is proof of the importance of the tourism industry, which reaches into all parts of the country, rural and urban, and is a valued source of employment for many thousands of people in Ireland. In the time given to me, I will try to address some of the issues raised today. If I do not get back to Senators, I will ask my officials to follow up with them. Some Senators raised concerns about hotel accommodation. I wish to point out, firstly, that since Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine in February of this year, more than 65,000 people who have been forced to leave their homes in the most horrific circumstances have sought refuge here. Approximately 50,000 of them are being provided with accommodation by the State. It is by far the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the Irish State. Tourism accommodation has played a vital part in this national response. I should highlight, at the outset, that tourism accommodation should be seen as a short-term solution not just for the tourism industry but also for the families who reside in those hotels. It cannot be seen as a long-term solution. I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry and sectoral bodies for the 2023 season. As we know, St. Patrick's day kicks off the peak season, although Senator Wall might argue that St. Brigid's day will mark the start of the season. I am aware that the contracting of tour group accommodation is significantly down on normal levels, and of the potential knock-on effect that the lack of availability of tourism accommodation could have on the wider tourism economy. Officials from my Department have communicated these concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and I know that the Department is working urgently across Government with agencies, NGOs and local authorities to bring new accommodation on stream. I am aware that alternative modular housing will come on stream from January, with a number of sites in place. Allied to that is the increase in the monthly recognition payment to €800, effective from 1 December. The local authorities have launched a new initiative, appealing to those who have unoccupied properties to offer them as temporary homes for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Senators will be aware that the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation has published a report outlining the consequences of an overdependence on tourism accommodation stock and its proposed policy recommendations. I met with representatives of the confederation last week to discuss this issue in particular and the report. My officials have also highlighted the recommendations of the report at the meetings of the senior officials group that is engaged in the humanitarian accommodation effort. At all times, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. We are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war.  A number of Senators raised the issue of VAT. Obviously, the responsibility for VAT lies with the Minister for Finance. When the 9% VAT rate was introduced, it was initially planned to be for a period of 14 months. The rate was then extended for another eight months to 31 August 2022, and extended again to 28 February 2023. The Minister for Finance stated, on budget day, that he was not going to extend the lower rate of VAT beyond 28 February. I really believe, given the uncertainty ahead, that we must remain vigilant and we must keep reviewing the situation in case there are any downturns in the recovery in the coming months. We will keep that under review after Christmas. The issues of the recruitment, training, development and conditions of staff were raised by a number of Senators. The recruitment and retention of staff continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector not just in Ireland, but in many countries around the world. Prior to Covid, the sector had registered consistent increases in the numbers employed in Ireland's regions, and was an important driver of greater regional balance and dispersed economic activity. A sustained and sustainable rebuild is essential, as tourism supports communities and drives regional development in a manner unlike other sectors. I have worked with colleagues across Government to secure funding supports to keep the tourism sector alive during Covid, and to support the initial rebuild phase in 2022 and beyond. My Department participates in the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are also working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles.  With regard to the working conditions in the sector, Fáilte Ireland's research indicated that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. While this is a good proportion, Fáilte Ireland has arranged programmes to build skills and capability for businesses and individual employees, including a suite of online self-directed professional development courses. The number of vacancies across the industry has fallen, and is now estimated to be 22,000, down from the previously estimated 40,000. Around 70% of businesses that are recruiting are increasing pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other perks such as compensation for working unsocial hours, which is becoming increasingly common. The research also shows that staff retention has become less difficult, with employers reporting improvements in day-to-day operations. As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector, Fáilte Ireland has risen to the challenge and has launched the new employer excellence programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices and enhance their reputations as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of the workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across businesses. Hopefully, this programme will also lead to greater retention of staff and improve the view of the industry as a career choice.  Senator Cassells spoke of the value of the Fáilte Ireland investment to date and the ongoing work in County Meath and south Louth. Senator Carrigy spoke of the development of hidden heartlands as a brand. It has been and is making a difference. I will ask my officials to communicate Senator Currie's suggestions on the potential of Dublin 15 to Fáilte Ireland . On Senator Ward's comments on St. Brigid's day, central to it will be Kildare County Council's plans which are being developed at present. Fáilte Ireland, through its Ireland's ancient east brand, is engaging with Kildare County Council to offer advice and support with promotion, particularly through Fáilte Ireland's Discover Ireland platforms.  Finally, to conclude, I would like to take the opportunity acknowledge the work of two tourism State agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. While this legislation does appear technical in nature, it has an important outcome in that that allows the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland's work in the area of tourism, the value of which Senators have commented on. We continue to further develop Ireland's tourism offerings in order to entice visitors to come to Ireland and to return time and again. However, that is dependent on continued innovation in the experiences we offer, and that is where Fáilte Ireland comes into play. This Bill will allow the channel of funding to Fáilte Ireland to continue its incredibly important work in this area. I thank Senators for their engagement. 
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The objective of the amendments in this grouping is to ensure that local sound broadcasters can avail of the scheme for professional journalistic practices which is being provided for in the Bill. Under this scheme grant funding will be available for broadcasters to provide training or professional development for persons employed by or providing services to the broadcaster in relation to promoting good professional journalistic practices. Without the amendments, this scheme would be restricted to community sound broadcasters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, it is.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group contains a range of technical amendments made to the Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 is to clarify that the definition of programme schedule in the Bill encompasses both audiovisual programmes and sound programmes and that references to programmes in the definition of sound broadcasting services are references to sound programmes. The purpose of amendment No. 11 was to correct a typographical error in the definition of video sharing platform service in the Bill. The purpose of amendments Nos. 17, 18, 21, 23 to 24 inclusive, and 37 was to align the wording in the Bill regarding the roles of the Minister with responsibility for Coimisiún na Meán and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to certain financial and staffing matters with the wording in the public spending code. They are technical amendments as such and do not have any substantive effect on the Bill. Amendment No. 22 changes a reference to "a nominee of the person" in line 36 on page 25 to "a person acting on behalf of the person". The wording to be inserted is considered more suitable for the section which relates to the disclosure of interests as it is more encompassing than the term "nominee". The purpose of amendments Nos. 35, 36, 39, 40, 51, 74, 77, 78, 79, 90, 119, 292 and 293 was to correct typographical errors in a range of sections of the Bill. The purpose of amendments Nos. 68, 291 and 296 was to take account of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022 and in particular, amendments Nos. 68 and 291 update references to sections of the Referendum Act 1998 and to the Referendum Commission so that they now refer to the Electoral Reform Act and An Coimisiún Toghcháin, the new Electoral Commission. Amendment No. 296 amends a reference in the Electoral Reform Act to the Broadcasting Act 2009 so that it now refers to the relevant section of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think the point the Senator makes relates to the next group of amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of this group of amendments was to make provision in the Bill for an individual complaints mechanism as recommended by the online safety expert group in its comprehensive report. I acknowledge that this issue was of considerable interest and concern for Senators in this Chamber, particularly those who are members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, and one that I committed to examining in detail before returning to this House. When I established the expert group earlier this year, I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, then I would provide for it in the Bill and that is what I am proposing to do with these amendments. The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian eSafety Commissioner. The group's report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual focused on the operation of the mechanism on a phased basis, firstly for children. These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group's report and hew closely to the group's recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. In this regard, amendment No. 89 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how An Coimisiún can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content, the threshold which must be met before An Coimisiún will handle complaints, the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to An Coimisiún, and a requirement for An Coimisiún to set out a plan for operating these provisions. The remaining amendments in this group are consequential.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a group of purely technical amendments made in the Dáil to insert a definition of "e-commerce directive" into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions. This was done to avoid repeating the title of the directive where it is referenced in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group of amendments made during the Bill's passage through the Dáil seeks to clarify that the jurisdictional test for when a relevant online service which is not a video-sharing platform service is established in Ireland is set out in Article 3 of the e-commerce directive. Amendment No. 14 contains the substantive section, a new section 2C to be inserted into the 2009 Act. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 involve consequential renumbering. These amendments are purely to give greater legal clarity as to how jurisdiction for such services is determined under the Bill and do not in substance alter the legal framework set out in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senators will recall that during the debate in the Seanad, I signalled that "party political programme" was intended to have the same meaning as "party political broadcast", namely, the short programmes carried on our public service broadcaster during electoral periods for the purpose of promoting a registered political party. The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure it encompassed both broadcasts broadcast by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider. It was to ensure it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player. Senators and a number of stakeholders, including RTÉ and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, sought clarity in the Bill that "party political programme" had essentially the same meaning as "party political broadcast". Given the importance of providing clarity on this matter, I introduced amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide for a definition of "party political programme" in the Bill. I also introduced amendment No. 53 to provide that media service codes which will apply to broadcasting and video on-demand services may provide that party political programmes may only be available at specified times. Currently, party political broadcasts are only made available during electoral periods. This provision is intended to make explicit coimisiún na meán's authority to specify the timing of party political programmes. The intention is that these times shall continue to be during electoral periods. However, to provide flexibility, the provision refers to "specified times" rather than "electoral periods" to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard. I also introduced amendment No. 50 to clarify the meaning of a phrase regarding not giving unfair preference to any political party in respect of the allocation of broadcasting time or the positioning of content in a catalogue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To provide flexibility, the provision refers to "specified times" rather than "electoral periods" to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard. It will be a matter for the electoral commission. This will allow coimisiún na meán to change if anything happens at the electoral commission. It gives a flexibility to adapt but it is a matter for the electoral commission. It relates to how those commissions will work with each other because one will affect the other. There may be a need to come back to that point, depending on a decision of the electoral commission. This gives flexibility to coimisiún na meán.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	During the Seanad Committee and Report Stage debates on the Bill, a number of Senators indicated they considered the provision that prohibits broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services making available programmes which may reasonably be considered to cause harm or offence as being potentially contrary to the principles of freedom of expression. At that stage, I committed to examining the matter. Having examined and considered the matter, I brought amendments on the Dáil Committee Stage to qualify the standard applied to broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services from "offence" to one of "undue offence". This aligns the language in the Bill with the standard of harm or undue offence to material applied by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland through its code of programme standards, ensuring the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group of amendments is intended to allow coimisiún na meán to make media service codes which promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes on radio, television and video on-demand services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works composed or performed by women on radio services. A key goal of mine, as Minister, is to further gender equality within every sector under my remit and to collaborate closely with my Government colleagues to drive change across other key Departments. It is an issue that Senators raised with me and one I had committed to examining and returning to. Young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see or hear and there needs to be a significant improvement in the ratio of women to men on radio and television, so that both genders feel represented in public discourse, as well as better representation of women in music on our airwaves. Following careful consideration of the compatibility of gender balance measures with the rights to freedom of expression and competition law, it is considered that the most appropriate approach to further this goal is to empower coimisiún na meán to make codes setting out standards and practices in relation to the promotion of greater representation for women in music and news broadcasting. Such codes will be binding on providers of radio, television and video on-demand services and, where breaches occur, such codes could be subject to enforcement action by coimisiún na meán. This approach will allow coimisiún na meán the flexibility to identify appropriate measures to promote gender equality that are consistent with our legal framework.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of this group of amendments is to provide absolute clarity that coimisiún na meán can dismiss a complaint in circumstances where it has already been effectively resolved under a code of practice prepared by a provider.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a technical amendment to remedy a drafting error in the Bill. This amendment will ensure a section 70 contractor can continue to benefit from the exemption as set out in section 71(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 70 and 71 remove the statutory requirements for RTÉ and TG4 to establish and to maintain their respective teletext services. This change was agreed in consultation with our public service broadcasters and is considered important to allow progression from outdated technologies with very small viewerships.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These amendments are intended to address an anomaly by removing the reference to "terminal". This change, though largely technical in nature, will future-proof the prominence rules to allow them to reflect continuing changes in the ways in which audiovisual content is accessed and viewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group of amendments inserts into the Bill provisions which require that coimisiún na meán must give reasonable notice of an audit to a provider of its designated online service and to provide an opportunity for designated online platforms to make submissions in respect of an audit report prior to its publication. This is to ensure legal clarity on the operation of these provisions and to ensure audits are not delayed or challenged on the basis of a lack of notice given. Allowing for submissions would not change the outcome of an audit report. The comments made by the designated online platform in question may also be published alongside the audit report. These provisions mirror similar requirements under the provisions for reports by authorised officers and are a key due process requirement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 are to clarify that coimisiún na meán may make online safety guidance materials on the risk test for non-offence specific harmful online content and may make online safety guidance materials on matters relating to the online safety aspects of the Bill rather than simply in general. Amendment No. 94 is a consequential renumbering amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These amendments will add existing offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 relating to online flashing to the schedule of offence-specific harmful online content in the Bill. This will enable the online safety commissioner to make binding online safety codes that will apply to designated online service providers and that will require those providers to take measures to tackle online flashing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of these amendments is to ensure appropriate remuneration and expenses are agreed and paid to appointed authorised officers. Of course, it is already the case that authorised officers who are members of an coimisiún staff would be remunerated. These amendments, however, will ensure any other individuals, such as external subject experts, are also appointed under terms and conditions set out by an coimisiún. Those terms and conditions, as is standard for such matters, are subject to the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of these amendments is to require coimisiún na meán to state the geographical area in which the action required of an online service addressed by a content limitation notice is to be taken. This is to provide legal clarity in that regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 274 to 277, inclusive, provide for consultation on preparing content production schemes between an coimisiún and Screen Ireland and provide that anyone can apply for funding under a scheme. Amendments Nos. 287 to 290, inclusive, allow for the Minister to provide by order that Screen Ireland may make a scheme and that an coimisiún should fund one. Amendments Nos. 278 and 279 clarify that all aspects of the development of European works may benefit from funding under a content production scheme. Amendment No. 279 also brings the content production scheme into line with the sound and vision scheme, pursuant to section 154(2)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, in respect of requirements that audiovisual programmes funded under the scheme are made available on a free television service or video on-demand service. Amendment No. 280 sets out that at least 80% of annual funding provided through a scheme must be allocated to independent producers. Our approach will also ensure a minimum of 25% of funds raised through a content production scheme must be allocated to the production of Irish language content. Amendments Nos. 281 to 286, inclusive, set out the guidelines and principles to be followed in defining "independent producers" for the purposes of any scheme. In particular, the amendments provide that an independent producer may be defined by reference to the ownership of rights to use commercially any programme supported under a scheme. This is aimed at promoting the retention of rights in the Irish audiovisual sector.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as an spéis a léirigh siad sa Bhille agus an mionscrúdú a rinne siad ar na forálacha. As Senators stated on the first day we debated this, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is crucial legislation. It modernises the regulation of the media ecosystem in Ireland and lays the foundations for the new regulatory frontier of online safety, which will be of great importance when it comes to protecting our children online. Key to this is the establishment of a robust and agile regulator, coimisiún na meán, whose remit will continue to grow in the coming years. An coimisiún will ultimately be responsible for enforcing key pieces of EU regulatory legislation, including the revised audiovisual media services directive, the Digital Services Act and aspects of the terrorist content regulation. It will have an important role in ensuring media sustainability and development. This Bill is the first step in a rolling legislative programme in this space in the coming years. I thank the officials in my Department for their tireless work and engagement with Senators and Deputies on my behalf during the passage of the Bill through both Houses. The Bill is of fundamental importance to protecting our society, particularly our children, from serious forms of harmful online content and finally ensuring online platforms are appropriately held to account. I know all Senators and Deputies are cognisant of the significance of the legislation. I acknowledge and thank Senators and Deputies for their constructive feedback and input inside and outside the Houses over the past year.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as cabhrú leis an mBille seo a chur chun cinn go pras. As I have outlined previously, this is a technical enabling Bill but its outcome is important in that it allows for the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland's work in the area of tourism product development. I look forward to working alongside Fáilte Ireland as we continue to further the development of Ireland's tourism offering.  As Senator Garvey said, I am the Minister with responsibility for tourism but I am also a green Minister and deputy leader of the Green Party, which I would never forget. I am working on the development of a sustainable tourism policy and I see amazing opportunities ahead as we emerge from Covid. My engagement with the industry tells me that stakeholders want to embrace sustainability and put the green into our Emerald Isle. We have so much to offer here in terms of slow tourism and long stays but we must make sure that the protection of our environment is at the core of what we do. This new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable economic development in communities throughout the country while protecting our environment and natural resources. It will also aim to promote a greater spread into the regions and encourage longer stays. I will raise the concerns articulated by Senator Garvey, some of which are the responsibility of Fáilte Ireland while others are under the remit of local authorities.  I acknowledge the concerns of Senator Cassells regarding accommodation. We are in the middle of what is, by some distance, the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the State as we give refuge and shelter to those who are fleeing the most horrific circumstances in Ukraine. However, as I said last week in this Chamber, I am very aware of the concerns relating to the wider tourism industry and am engaging on a consistent basis with the sector. My officials and myself are also engaging with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Across the board in government, we are working urgently to source alternative accommodation from agencies, NGOs, and local authorities. I am cognisant of the need to ensure tourist accommodation is available before the peak tourism season begins. That said, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine.  Senator Carrigy expressed a similar concern with regard to accommodation and also referred to the VAT rate in the tourism sector. As I have said previously, the latter is something that we will keep under constant review. We may have to make a call on it in the new year. I thank Senator Boyhan for his kind words.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	On the day that is in it, I will take the opportunity to congratulate all our Irish Oscar nominees. I am so delighted that "An Cailín Ciúin" has made history today as the first Irish language film to be nominated. Beidh sé go hiontach ár dteanga dhúchais a bheith á cur os comhair an tsaoil mhóir oíche na nOscars. I also congratulate Paul Mescal and Colin Farrell for their best actor nominations, and, of course, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon. The record number of Irish nominations is a testament to the strength of Irish culture and arts. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis na daoine go léir a ainmníodh. Gan amhras, léiríonn siad go léir cumhacht na hÉireann mar fhórsa cultúrtha.
I will return now to another stronghold of Irish arts and culture, namely, the National Concert Hall, NCH. Is Bille tábhachtach é agus tá áthas orm é a chur faoi bhráid an Tí. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legal framework to support the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. This legislation represents a critical step forward for the concert hall as Ireland's national cultural institution for music by making explicit the role of the orchestra within that institution and formalising the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall. It also strengthens the State's indemnity for the loan of international art, ensuring that our citizens can continue to enjoy access to important international exhibitions. Since the National Symphony Orchestra performed at the inaugural concert of the National Concert Hall in 1981, the orchestra and concert hall have been inextricably entwined in the public consciousness, most notably through their Friday night concerts. The NSO was founded by RTÉ in 1948 at a time when there was intense demand for broadcast orchestral music. Since then, however, the nature of media and its consumption have been transformed. This, coupled with the acute operational challenges facing the orchestra, has raised questions as to the appropriateness of its continued location within RTÉ. There was also a growing recognition that the orchestra could no longer reach its fullest potential within the structures of a public service broadcaster. In response to these challenges, RTÉ commissioned a report from consultant, Ms Helen Boaden, which was published in April 2018. It recommended that the orchestra become a national cultural institution in its own right or be positioned within the NCH and funded directly by Government. The report also proposed that the orchestra be restored to its historical levels of staffing and activity. For my part, this recommendation is critical to achieving greater engagement with audiences, developing education programmes and expanding the reach of the orchestra. In July 2018, the Government agreed that the NSO should be brought within the concert hall's remit. The Department commissioned a report that estimated the full operational costs of the orchestra to be approximately €8 million per annum. To support this process, my Department established an oversight group and a working group comprising representatives from the orchestra, choirs, RTÉ, the concert hall and the unions. During this process, it was agreed that the RTÉ Philharmonic Choir, RTÉ Cór Linn and RTÉ Cór na nÓg should also transfer to the concert hall given the collaborative nature of their work. Protecting the staff and ensuring that their rights were maintained was a key consideration throughout the stakeholder engagement. The Department engaged a financial consultant to provide advice on pensions and benefits to transferring employees. Following extensive consultation, all queries relating to the employees terms and conditions and pension entitlements were fully addressed. Having completed the consultation, the Government approved the transfer of the orchestra and choirs from the RTÉ to the NCH on an administrative basis on 24 January 2022. This transfer was affected on the advice that sections 7 and 9 of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015 were broad enough to include the transfer of the NSO as part of the broader function of the hall to promote and support the performance of music. The transfer also complied with transfer of undertakings (protection of employment) regulations, TUPE, where transferring members of the NSO and choirs were guaranteed to retain the terms and conditions the enjoyed in RTÉ. Although the transfer was affected on an administrative basis within the existing legislation, I believe that our objective of a strengthened orchestra requires additional legislative underpinning. To that end, the Bill specifically provides for a new function for the concert hall for the management of the orchestra. It also provides for a voice for the orchestra at the highest levels with the inclusion of a new board member with orchestral expertise. I am pleased to inform the House that today, on the one-year anniversary of the transfer, the National Symphony Orchestra is in the process of being restored to its full playing complement. My Department has since provided sanction to the hall to recruit a music librarian and six musician posts on a permanent basis as well as more than 20 fixed-term player contract positions while the orchestra reviews its long-term needs. This is in addition to a significant number of additional support positions to meet the programming and other needs of the orchestra. Over the year, it also came to my attention that some of the orchestra's musical instruments required replacement. My Department has since provided substantial support to the concert hall for the purchase of a range of international quality instruments. All this investment is taking place within the overall redevelopment of the National Concert Hall as part of the implementation of this Government's national development plan. The concert hall, with the Office of Public Works, OPW, has developed exciting plans for the Earlsfort Terrace site. I was delighted to announce the Government's approval in principle of the project last month. The redevelopment plans will create a fit-for purpose 21st century auditorium that will establish the concert hall as the cultural institution for music, providing for new public spaces, new learning and participation facilities and spaces to support music resource organisation that are essential to our music ecology and much more. The Bill includes an amendment I introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil. Section 14 amends the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 to increase the limit of the State's indemnity for the loan of cultural objects from outside the State from €190 million to €1.6 billion. The original figure is no longer fit for purpose as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the values of artworks and cultural artefacts, nor for the recent growth in opportunities for important touring exhibitions to come to Ireland. Currently, our cultural institutions must arrange commercial insurance, which is a significant additional overhead. The State indemnity enables our cultural institutions to meet the requirements of international museums and collectors, making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high-profile exhibitions. Returning to the detail of the detail of the Bill, I acknowledge the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media and its examination of the general scheme.The purpose of the Bill is to bring the orchestra and choirs within the statutory framework of the concert hall, providing for appropriate reporting to me and to the Oireachtas. It also provides for the legal transfer of all undertakings related to the orchestra to the concert hall as well as amending the Broadcasting Act 2009 to reflect the transfer of the orchestra from RTÉ. I will now introduce the specific provisions of the Bill. The Bill is divided into four Parts. Part 1 deals with general provisions such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the legislation. Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property, and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH. These provisions date from the transfer day of 24 January 2022. This Part amends the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015 by inserting a number of new sections into the principal Act. Section 4 provides for the transfer of functions, administration and business relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the NCH on the transfer day. Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, are technical in nature and provide for the transfer of all undertakings, staff, assets and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs to the NCH on the transfer day. Section 9 substitutes the name of the National Concert Hall for that of RTÉ in any legal proceedings relating to the orchestra or choirs while section 10 provides that every act done by RTÉ or the NCH in respect of the transfer prior to the commencement of this part shall be deemed valid and effectual for all purposes. Part 3 sets out a number of amendments to the principal Act to reflect the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the operation of the NCH. In this regard, the critical section is section 11, which amends section 7 of the principal Act by adding a new function for the maintenance and operation of an orchestra and choir to the functions of the concert hall. Section 12 builds on this by including the orchestra in the corporate governance structures of the concert hall. It does this by amending section 10 of the principal Act to increase the membership of the board from eight members to nine. This additional board member is required to have expertise in the development of orchestras, ensuring that the appropriate expertise is present on the board at all times. Following on from that, section 13 is a technical amendment to increase the quorum for board meetings from four to five. As I outlined previously, in Part 4, section 14 amends the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 to increase the limit of the State's indemnity for the loan of cultural objects from outside the State from €190 million to €1.6 billion. The final Part, Part 5, amends the functions of RTÉ, as set out in section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 15 replaces RTÉ's previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only. Although largely technical in nature, the Bill represents the culmination of the journey that the NSO, the NCH, RTÉ, myself and my Department have been on in recent years to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music. The legislation represents the beginning of a new chapter, as we turn our minds to supporting the orchestra and the concert hall to thrive in an evolving environment and to remain at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come. When President Hillery opened the National Concert Hall in 1981, he described it as "the realisation of a dream long cherished". This Bill brings that dream, shared by music and arts lovers nationwide, closer to reality. Mar a deireann an seanfhocal, is fearr súil romhat ná dhá shúil i do dhiaidh. Táim cinnte go bhfuilimid go léir ag cur ár súile romhainn leis an mBille seo. I am delighted to bring the Bill before the Seanad. I look forward to hearing the contributions throughout Second Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their contributions. I am encouraged by the engagement we have seen on the Bill and the various issues related to it.This Bill represents a crucial stage in the journey of both the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Concert Hall. The transfer of the orchestra and this Bill mark an important next step in addressing the challenges for the orchestra as highlighted by the Boaden report and in delivering the National Concert Hall's vision of being an inspiring and world-renowned music destination. The NSO, as Ireland's premier orchestra, is central to delivering on this vision which, coupled with the ambitious redevelopment plans for the concert hall announced last month, will see it transform into the pre-eminent centre for music in Ireland. I am proud to say that I have already provided the necessary sanctions to bring the orchestra back to full strength. I am putting in place the necessary funding for investment in new and much-needed instruments for the orchestra. In the time allotted to me, I will try to address as many issues as possible, as raised by Senators. If I do not address the issues they raised, I will get officials to contact them. I welcome Senator Cassells's intervention on touring and the opportunities that redevelopment will present. As the concert hall is currently developing plans for its relocation, which will be finalised as the project nears construction, it will inevitably require alternative spaces for performance, rehearsal and administration. While the details are still being worked out, the concert hall's plan will be worked out based on a similar level of activity to that which currently happens. It is also looking at what opportunities might emerge from this period of relocation, especially with respect to engaging new audiences around the country and new locations within Dublin. As such, I believe the Senator can expect more touring as we restore and revive this important building and institution. Senator Sherlock raised management issues. We are working closely with the National Concert Hall to ensure a smooth transition. We are supporting a change management process and I understand a dedicated consultant has been appointed to support this process. Senators Black and Sherlock raised the matter of filling the NSO vacancies. Before the transfer was effected earlier this year, there was uncertainty regarding the funding model for the orchestra. This impacted the orchestra both operationally and with regard to recruitment. As I said earlier, the NSO was below the playing complement to perform the full classical repertoire, which led to a reliance on casual musicians to supplement the orchestra for nearly every single performance. On the transfer day, 54 musicians and nine ancillary staff moved from RTÉ to the concert hall. Since then, the National Concert Hall has worked diligently to begin the process of returning the orchestra to its full playing strength. This has included much internal discussion on the development of a specialist recruitment process that will best serve the needs of the orchestra. The recruitment of musicians to a permanent position in a national orchestra is far removed from the typical process of interviews or testing that one might see in another field. It involves players auditioning both individually and on a trial basis with a larger orchestra. It can take several months to ensure that musicians of the highest calibre are recruited. Over the last seven months, my Department has sanctioned the filling of a number of a number of vacant positions within the orchestra and choirs. These included permanent posts such as music librarian, orchestra leader and first violin, as well as section leaders for percussion, double bass, horns and timpani, as well as a principal bass trombone. I feel I am back in the classroom teaching the four families of the orchestra. The National Concert Hall has also received sanction for 26 fixed-term guest musician contracts and contract extensions for four choral co-ordinators, along with a number of support staff to support the orchestra's important work. It is my intention that we will approve more permanent posts this quarter as we balance the immediate needs and long-term vision for a restored orchestra. Senator McDowell knows that the future of media commission made 50 recommendations about media in Ireland, including public service broadcasting. I recently published an implementation report in respect of that. I committed to the Government that I will get back to it on the question of reforming the licensing system. I assure the Senator that the future of public service broadcasting and a strongly functioning media sector is a key priority for me. He commented on opportunities for the site itself. We will bring back that fresher life to it. As he knows, before Christmas I was delighted to announce Government approval in principle for the vast overhaul and redevelopment of the concert hall. It is an exciting project which will deliver the expansion, refurbishment and remodelling of the main auditorium, increasing the overall space by 40% to 1,500 sq. m. It will have additional balconies and an extension to the rear which will provide access and services essential to the concert hall. It will add about 150 to 225 additional seats depending on the configuration. The redevelopment will renovate and open up the main entrance foyer, creating a multi-function modern space with new access to historic marble stairs, universal access, an enhanced reception, booking offices and other services. It will remodel the old medical library as a new rehearsal hall for the National Symphony Orchestra because it currently rehearses in the main auditorium, which limits the opportunities for daytime performances. Refurbishment of the 1865 block, including the John Field room and the provision of new dressing rooms, offices, a canteen, library, studio and other services, includes the refurbishment and restoration of the historic and currently vacant 1865 site to include musician facilities, performance, rehearsal and practice spaces, storage and side-stage areas. Overall, the changes will upgrade a massive 16,300 sq. m of the Earlsfort Terrace site. They will protect and restore this heritage asset and create the necessary infrastructure for the much-expanded national cultural institution for music, which I think will get global attention when it is completed. Senator Warfield asked about the costs of such a project. It is a flagship project under the national cultural institutions investment programme. It will represent the largest single investment in a national cultural institution in a generation. While the appraisal to date has provided a robust estimate of costs, the actual costs will be established when we go to market. Given that the project still has to go to tender, it would not be appropriate to make an estimate public at this stage. The budget itself will continue to be elaborated and refined as the process proceeds through the planning and detailed design stages and ultimately when it goes to tender. Senator Warfield raised concerns about the cultural amenity licence in the legislation which is before the Joint Committee on Justice today. I am aware of concerns about it. My officials are engaging with the relevant stakeholders. Senator Sherlock raised the importance of reaching diverse audiences. I highlight, as she did, the incredible success of the Haunted Dancehall event. Other Senators raised that too. It was an electronic music night at the National Concert Hall, supported by my Department as a pilot event for the night-time economy. This pilot demonstrated the exciting potential of the National Concert Hall to serve as a centre for all types of music, to embrace all audiences and to reach out to all walks of life. When I visited the concert hall recently, the board members were hugely animated by what happened that weekend, its success and the opportunity to access entirely new demographics. I hope to see much more of that. Senator Dolan raised music support and outreach in general. As she mentioned, Music Generation would be key to that. As I outlined today, the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022 is a technical Bill. It provides for the transfer of functions from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall as well as an increase to the limit of the State indemnity for the loan of international artworks to nine of our cultural institutions. I thank Senators for their engagement today. My officials have noted all the issues they raised. I am sure these will become part of our considerations if related to the Bill. I have heard other concerns that may be outside the scope of this Bill but are relevant to my portfolio. I request that any Senators who intend to table amendments to the Bill give departmental officials sight of their amendments at an early date so that, where possible and appropriate, they can be given due consideration. As I said, this Bill represents an important step in the journey of the orchestra and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the redevelopment of symphonic music in Ireland, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st-century concert hall. This legislation will enable the National Concert Hall to commence the process of returning the orchestra to full strength and empower it to deliver on the recommendations outlined in the Boaden report. I acknowledge the hard work of my officials in preparing the Bill, which I am pleased to introduce to the Seanad. I look forward to making steady progress and I commend it to the House.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their engagement on the Bill last week. Is Bille tábhachtach é an Bille um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta (An Ceoláras Náisiúnta) (Leasú) 2022. It represents a crucial step forward in the journey of the National Symphony Orchestra, the choirs and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st century concert hall. The legislation will also help to support the concert hall's efforts to return the orchestra to full strength by embedding it and the choirs into the corporate structure of the concert hall. The amendment to increase the limit of the State indemnity is a necessary measure that will support our cultural institutions to continue to present exhibitions of international quality to the Irish public. Gabhaim buíochas less na Seanadóirí as a mbreithiúnas ar an mBille seo. I look forward to commencing it in its entirety as soon as possible after its enactment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for coming. He referred to a saving of €24 million on primary teachers' salaries. That indicates that there is room to further address the issue of pay inequality in the teaching profession. There is quite an increase of €100 million in capital expenditure. Was there a huge underestimation of how much would be needed to complete projects? There is huge concern in my constituency about the number of primary school projects that have been announced. They are badly needed because, as the Minister knows, places cannot even be found for some primary school students who were displaced owing to a recent school closure. There is concern about insufficient investment in second level schools and that we will reach a stage where children will not be able to find places in such schools. Is there a need for a review of expenditure on secondary school projects? In respect of the allocation of €37 million for superannuation payments to teaching and non-teaching staff, will the figure increase year on year? Is there an exact way of forecasting what will be needed in future years?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On that concern I raised, there is a feeling that what happens when both second-level schools and primary schools are announced is the staff go off into one Department but those who are designing the second-level schools never talk to those who are designing the primary schools, and then there is a massive problem. I was talking to a planner recently and that is the view.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My issue was not about the type of second-level schools or parents' preferences. There is a huge concern that, a few years down the road, there will not be enough second level schools in the constituency which I represent. I wonder if this is reflected in other constituencies. Primary schools are badly needed because of population growth but when children who are now in junior and senior infants get to sixth class there will not be enough places in second level schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Byrne and echo his call on the Minister. It would be very helpful at this stage if the Minister would commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work. It is no longer a matter of newly qualified teachers, NQTs, but lesser-paid teachers, LPTs. If we are truly to value education and the job primary school teachers do, in particular in shaping our young children, we should hear the Minister commit - just that word - to the principle of equal pay for equal work.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the money that is available to the Minister for the provision of salary increases for TUI and INTO members, what moneys are available to him should the ASTI come on board? I am sure the Minister is watching the call for the special convention within the ASTI. Who knows what could happen there. Something could happen sooner than we think. Is the money there if the ASTI comes on board? On middle management, if that is the word for it, can I discuss that here within secondary schools?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am glad the Minister is carrying out a review but it is really at crisis level. The Minister knows how vulnerable many children in these schools are. I am aware of one DEIS school where the principal has had to take on the role of student council liaison teacher, traditionally a B post. The same principal now holds, due to retirement, the A post of first year head. He is dealing with first years transitioning from primary to second level. It is a crucial role. The usual route for disciplinary procedures in a school is from class teacher to year head to vice principal to principal, but for students in first year in this school their year head is their principal. From a discipline point of view it is chaos. It is a recipe for disaster. That needs to be addressed as soon as possible as there are vulnerable children suffering. I welcome the two thirds restoration in the guidance allocation. What is the timeframe for the full restoration of guidance teachers? I am sure it was just a turn of phrase but, with all due respect, I do not think teachers would appreciate the phrase "time off" in respect of training for junior cycle. It is not time off. Teachers are preparing to do their jobs. It is work. I assume that was just a turn of phrase and there was no negative intent.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have a comment on what I said earlier and on what Deputies Byrne and Nolan have brought up.I would welcome the restoration of ex quota guidance counsellors. I would be appalled if there is a play on words happening because those involved are playing with students and children who need this support as it was before the 2012 cuts.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to comment on the same issue. The Minister has said that he would expect them to be professionally equipped but earlier he spoke about best practice and said in the same breath that there is nothing wrong with a science teacher giving guidance to a student. One could, however, have an excellent science teacher who has no idea what courses are available out there because the truth is that the guidance counsellors in the schools are in regional groups that meet regularly and unlike a science teacher, they constantly update and share their skills and information with one other. We would not expect the guidance teacher to teach some science on the side so why would we expect the science teacher to teach some guidance on the side? This all goes back to the original decision in 2012, before the Minister's time but he was in government. I believe the role of the guidance counsellor is completely undervalued by the Government and its predecessor. It is an absolutely crucial role and yet we wonder why one in six students in college is dropping out in first year. They are not getting the proper guidance counselling because since 2012, they have not been receiving it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I brought this subject up before. I do not know if the Minister of State spoke to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, about the vision for transport and the possibility of biofuel or looking at a greener way of running school buses.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding C11, has the Minister considered allocating supports to students from low income families who are still being refused SUSI grants while doing their full-time degrees in independent third-level colleges, such as the Dublin Business School and Griffith College? Some students appeared before this committee in the past year who were really struggling and doing their best to get through third level, but needed access to the SUSI grants.  The Fine Gael manifesto mentioned €100 million of additional funding just to stand still. What supports there are fall way short of what is needed to significantly boost the standing of the sector. I would ask the Minister to address this.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I know it would be a policy change but is there any intention to do exactly that and to weigh up the pros and cons? We are talking about students from disadvantaged areas and low income families and, as the Chairman pointed out, the CAO form does not make it clear that they would be unable to access grants for their chosen courses. There is a journalism course, in particular, that attracts many students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to reiterate what all of the members have said. Through the Chair, I believe that section 7(3) of the Act is directly related to admissions to schools. The provision is fundamentally tied to it. The baptism barrier is a huge issue in admission policies as it allows discrimination across the board. It makes me wonder the following. Why have we discussed the Labour Party's Equal Status (Amendment) Bill for more than a year? Perhaps our discussions have been a complete waste of time and it should have been discussed by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice and Equality. It is bizarre if we have been misguided in that way and the legislation will be delayed. A huge issue of discrimination, along with the baptism barrier, is discrimination on the grounds of special educational needs. That is why I echo what Deputy Byrne has said. I am massively disappointed that the amendment that gives the National Council for Special Education the power to compel schools to open autistic units has been ruled out order. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am fully in favour of Deputy Shortall's proposal. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has raised the issue for the Minister’s attention that section 30(2)(e) of the Education Act 1998 provides that the Minister “shall not require any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student”. My amendments Nos. 56 and 84 deal with the opt-out for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. Many schools with a religious ethos do not have alternatives for children. We have scenarios where children will not attend school when communion and confirmation are being prepared for. There are students in secondary school who are told to sit at the back of the class, given a study class or told to go to the library when religious instruction takes place. There are no guidelines in place, however, for the schools or students. These two amendments would require the Minister to provide definite clarity and guidelines to schools on how they should put in place alternatives for children who do not wish to attend religious instruction and require a timeline for same.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appeal to the Minister to reconsider providing guidelines. There should be minimum standards in regard to the nature of the exemption for students. It is not fair on students who are being excluded, whether they are being put to the back of the classroom or sent to a library. It is not fair on the students and teachers in the class who want to study religion because teachers are being asked to manage classes and teach religion, along with dealing with seven others who are not doing the subject. That leads to discipline issues. Students coming into schools in September will see from the timetable that religion is scheduled for 2.40 p.m. on a Tuesday, but a student who does not do religion will ask what he or she should do, and his or her tutor will not know because the school has no idea what is happening. If those not studying religion are not included in the timetable provisions, will a teacher be available to supervise those students who are not sitting at the back of a classroom? Are those students unsupervised, which is wrong? Are they with an SNA, which is not fair on him or her?  It is a domino effect. I ask the Minister to set down minimum guidelines to at least ensure that those who are not studying religion are doing something of educational benefit during the time involved.We have to consider the children in the class who are willingly doing religion and ensure their learning experience is not impacted. With everything that is happening in society, particularly in the past year and a half, we should be promoting an inclusive approach. Instead, we have those who do religion and those who do not in the same classroom. That is wrong on many levels. I appeal to the Minister to put in place minimum standards to ensure that every child gets the best value out of their education.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is Deputy Thomas Byrne withdrawing-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Just for clarification, is amendment No. 83 being withdrawn?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, that is fine. I was just checking about amendment No. 83.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to that, is it specific to the unit or is just a case of the school catering for a specific special education need and stopping any other?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Where in the admission policy will it state what needs are catered for and what needs are not catered for?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If it is oversubscribed?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is because it is reserved for special education needs. Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are two matters to be clarified. First, did the Minister say it is not only the autism units? Second, if a special needs class was dealing with three specific needs, would that lead to a school deciding, for example, that a child who has all those needs but also has, for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and an emotion behaviour disorder, would not be suitable in terms of the needs provided for in the class and, therefore, the school will not take in the pupil?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Putting forward amendment No. 16 was the only way I could see of getting round the restriction of not being able to open up the Equal Status Act. I saw in it some way of tackling the baptism barrier. The amendment states: "In page 6, line 13, after “school” to insert “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”. I am of the opinion that this would mean schools which are State-funded could not then discriminate. Is the Minister suggesting this would only apply to the private schools? To clarify, we are talking about schools not aided by the Department of Education and Skills. If we are that specific, we can then tackle the baptism barrier to some extent.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, my amendment No. 16, by inserting “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”, is making the best of a bad situation but at least it would ensure that State-funded schools could not discriminate on the grounds of religion. It would make it very specific to privately-funded schools so, at least, the taxpayer would not be paying for discrimination. I ask members to support it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 16:In page 6, line 13, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 20 is in my name also, and I tabled amendment No. 55. These amendments require that in the case of Irish medium schools that are oversubscribed, these schools would have the right to assign priority to children who speak Irish as a home language or who are transferring from primary to secondary Gaelscoileanna.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Minister is proposing to accept the amendments? Will we hear more from him on Report Stage. Is that right?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In amendment No. 44, section (9)(b), why did the Minister decide on one in four, or 25%, of children of past pupils?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 44, section (9)(b).
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I referred to subsection (9)(b), which deals with the 25% quota. Deputy Tom Neville is referring to subsection (9)(a) which refers to siblings. I have absolutely no problem with it because it makes sense for siblings to be able to attend the same school, if only in managing a household, but I do have an issue with the 25% quota. I am still not convinced that it is evidence-based and believe it has been plucked from the air. Why stop at a parent and grandparent? Why not include a great-grandparent also? There could be circumstances in which the grandchild of someone who attended a school, who may be travelling 15 miles across the city to attend school, could have a greater right to attend it than a child who is living beside it. That one in four pupils could have this right just because he or she happens to be the grandson or granddaughter of a past pupil is bizarre, wrong and unfair. The measure is not about equality and equal access. Of course, I can see the argument about siblings and do not have an issue with it. The quota of 25% is way too high.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I, too, will be seeking to amend the section on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My amendment No. 39 is similar to my previous amendment No. 16, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills". It is an effort to ensure that State-funded schools are not funding discrimination.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 39:In page 7, line 23, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills".I called a vote on amendment No. 16 but I am happy to revisit this on Report Stage. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 55:In page 9, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit—(a) a primary school which teaches through the medium of Irish from giving priority in its admissions policy to students who speak Irish as a home language, or(b) a post primary school which teaches through the medium of Irish from giving priority in its admissions policy to students who speak Irish as a home language or who has attended a primary school which teaches through the medium of Irish.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 56:In page 9, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(3) (a) In particular, the Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, make regulations governing the age-appropriate arrangements to be made for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.(b) Such regulations shall have regard to the rights of students under the Constitution to attend a school in receipt of public funds without attending religious instruction or classes at that school.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 84:In page 11, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“(f) age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in relation to students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.”.I intend to press the amendment as I will bring it to Report Stage. This is similar to the one on which we voted already.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the first amendment under discussion amendment No. 100?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, but the first of my amendments is No. 100. This amendment proposes to insert the words "all reasonable efforts" after "the ability of the school to". This is in order to prevent that soft-barrier discrimination, creating more of an onus on schools to provide for a child before it can refuse to admit them. It would state that the NCSE should have regard to the ability of the school to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child, rather as it currently stands, that is, to have regard to the ability of the school to accommodate the child.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is amendment No. 121 also in this grouping? This is where I propose to delete lines 15 to 24 on page 13. There is a double barrier there for children with special educational needs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I feel there is a double barrier for children with special educational needs. Amendment No. 98, tabled by the Minister, creates a double barrier. A school might be able to discriminate on the grounds of religion, which would stop access for a child with special educational needs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I completely agree with Deputy Shortall on amendment No. 98 and I believe it will lead to further discrimination. To this end on Report Stage I will table amendments on the principle of what is in the best interests of the child.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would we not run the same risk with amendment No. 98? There is reference to having regard to "the admission policies of schools in the locality".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the Minister address that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That would be appreciated by everyone.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 100:In page 12, line 22, after "to" where it firstly occurs to insert "make all reasonable efforts to".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 113:In page 13, line 6, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of issues I will be bringing on Report Stage so I cannot agree to the section as it stands.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 9. My amendment No. 11 would define a student union as an independent body representing students. The concern is that it must be recognised by the institute to be a student union, as per the Government amendment. The student union should be an independent body elected by the students, as there is a risk it could be left out of procedures if it is not something recognised by the institute.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am still not content with the Government's definition of a student union. It could lead to a position where a student union exists and is accepted and elected by students but ignored by an institute. It is a key point. I am still not convinced by the Government's definition of student union.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to raise an issue relating to definitions in section 2 on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 20:In page 19, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:"(iii) contributes to the promotion of the economic, cultural and social development of the State,(iv) respects the diversity of values, beliefs and traditions in Irish society,(v) promotes critical and free enquiry, informed intellectual discourse and public debate within the technological university and in wider society.".This is to address the functions of the technological universities as set out on page 19 of the Bill, and that we try to promote critical thinking in public debate. Diversity of debate and values are key aspects of third level education and I see them as core. The language used in section 22 outlines the functions of the universities as collaborating with business, enterprise, professions, the community and related stakeholders in the region to ensure that in so far as possible innovation activity and research undertaken by technological universities will reflect the needs of those stakeholders. This is in direct contrast with the weak language on page 20 on promoting broader aims. The language regarding critical thinking, diversity, free speech, and the economic, social and cultural development of the State is only "where practicable" rather than "in so far as possible". The amendment is to place more emphasis on these being key and core aspects of third level education.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In reply to what the Minister of State said on amendment No. 20, I see the provision in section 22(k)(iii) which states "where practicable in the performance of its functions". This is my exact point. I believe this is weak wording and I wanted to place a bigger emphasis on it as being a core part of the university. My issue is with the language in section 22(k)(iii). I knew it was there, but I have an issue with the weakness of the language as I feel it should be a core function of a university.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will withdraw amendment No. 20 on the basis of what the Minister of State has said.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On a point of clarification, the Minister of State indicated she will engage with Deputies on this matter. When or how will this be done? Will she appear before the committee again?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with Deputy Burton that a definition of the term "citizens" is required. In the same way, a definition of the term "community" is also necessary as it is used frequently in the text. I do not know whether that should be noted or if I need to make a request to that effect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 20, line 28, to delete "where practicable" and substitute "promotes".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 37:In page 21, to delete lines 21 and 22 and substitute the following:“(i) be established following consultation with trade unions and staff associations representing employees of the technological university where the matters in dispute relate to staff, or with the student union where the matters in dispute relate to students,”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 39:In page 21, line 26 after “appropriate” to insert “as agreed by all parties listed at subparagraph (i) above”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is it the case that the amendments we have withdrawn will be engaged with by the Minister of State and her officials?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is currently no protection for student academic freedom in the legislation. That is why I tabled this amendment. I may table an amendment on Report Stage to protect collective academic freedom.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I want to press my amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am sorry, is that the amendment on greater student representation on the governing body?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 44 is ruled out of order, is it not?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, but on amendment No. 43 I want to bring a query to Report Stage. Will there be four academic staff on these larger governing bodies of 15 to 26 members? I would also like to ask about the need for community representatives on the governing body. I know in Waterford Institute of Technology there is a counsellor on the governing body to represent the community. I will be raising that on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My amendment, No. 44, was ruled out of order but my other amendment, No. 47, is quite similar to Deputy Funchion's but has not been ruled out of order while hers has been.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 47:In page 22, line 35, to delete “at least one but not more than 2” and substitute “at least one but not more than 3”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Chairman, I have a number of issues to raise but I can do so under the subheading rather than now. I concur with my colleagues on some of the issues they have raised.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Apologies, I should have come in on subhead A03. In general, I cannot let the opportunity go without raising the issue, as the Chair has referenced, of equal pay for equal work. Our young teachers play a vital role. They are highly skilled, specialised classroom practitioners with significant far-reaching responsibilities for our children on a daily basis. They are being devalued. The Minister spoke earlier about the recruitment in certain subjects. We will continue to shed teachers from urban areas due to extraordinary high rents. Their jobs simply are not allowing them continue teaching in the schools of their choice where they have permanent jobs. They are leaving, which is not good for the students. I would ask the Minister, not for the first time, to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work and set out a timeframe. I ask him to make that commitment and set out a timeframe. It cannot be done overnight but to give respect to these young teachers, I ask him to set out a timeframe for implementation. On the superannuation, the underestimation of those seeking to retire is worrying. On a breakdown, does the Minister know if teachers are retiring early? As a former teacher, I looked to the more senior members of staff. They play an extraordinarily important role in guiding a young teacher when he or she joins a staff. Are they retiring before their time? If so, has the Minister any idea why they are doing so? Is it a reflection of stress in the workplace? If that is the case, has any research been done on it? Does the Minister know whether any data has been gathered on that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	First, I want to acknowledge how willing the Minister of State always is to listen to and engage with Members when they raise individual constituency issues, and that has definitely been my experience. I thank him for that.  I have spoken to the Minister of State on an individual constituency issue so I will not deal with the ins and outs of it, although I may have to follow up with him after this meeting, if that is okay. There is some confusion over the application process and this has caused immense stress for some of the parents involved. As I said, I will raise that with the Minister of State after the meeting.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The second issue is in regard to schools that have temporary rather than permanent homes. There is a school in my constituency which has had a site identified in Ballinteer but there have been planning issues in regard to getting a permanent home, so the school has been temporarily housed in Churchtown. The students have been in Ballinteer and it has been a Ballinteer school for six years, but it is now in Churchtown. Some of the parents do not have cars. I am sure this is not the only place in Ireland where this has happened. Are there any plans to give some leniency in regard to providing school transport for students in this case?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a planning issue in Ballinteer. The school has been moved as the site could not hold it any longer, given the number of students. They are being temporarily housed in a school that had been closed down.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On a somewhat related point in regard to the minor works grant allocation, which I was delighted to see the Minister of State announce today, I notice that in 2015 it was announced on 5 November, last year it was announced on 17 November, this year it has been announced in December and it is indicated to be announced next in January 2019. This is very frustrating for schools and many schools have contacted me. One, a developing school, is delighted to have a brand new premises but it is spending 70% of its capitation on heating the school because, as a developing school, it gets the same funding as a small school in rural Ireland. The principal found the school was tapping into the money for books for next year to pay for salaries for cleaning and for heating. Are there any plans to announce the allocation sooner? I am a bit alarmed to see January 2019 has been indicated for the next announcement, which means the principal must face into next September still not knowing the allocation, which is quite difficult for a small developing school.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Like the previous speakers said, the elephant in the room is pay equality. I understand there may be some moves towards that and I welcome the Taoiseach's comments yesterday on possible new talks on the issue. It is something that needs to be tackled with the utmost urgency. Are the Taoiseach's comments an indication that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work? We know it cannot be done overnight. The recent report shows that. However, would the Government be willing to indicate a timeline for the delivery of equal pay for equal work? I have read today, like other Deputies, that, alarmingly, we do not have enough junior certificate home economics teachers to examine the practical element. It is going to delay it, which will cause stress for the students involved. Will the Minister outline the measures he is taking to address that issue or how will that affect the budget Estimates here? On career guidance counsellors, I do welcome the additional 100 posts. That will bring us to 500 of the 600 posts cut having been restored. However, that is based on the number of career guidance posts needed in 2011. The Minister in his opening statement referred to an expanding young population, so surely we should not be working towards a number for career guidance counsellors that was needed in 2011. It is 2018 now. We should be looking at delivering one guidance counsellor per 500 students at this stage. We are not going to achieve that if our marker is the 2011 number. What is the Minister's intention to deal with that? On the superannuation subhead, A8, and indeed in C10, in each of the past two years we have had to vote through a considerable Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year in respect of superannuation payments for teachers. I see this subhead is down 5% and 7% for the equivalent at third level this year. Does the Minister anticipate that we will be looking at a similar increased Supplementary Estimate come the end of 2018?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for his response. I asked whether the comments made by the Taoiseach yesterday indicate that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work. The Minister mentioned that a review of career guidance posts is under way and suggested that students might be able to access vital information in other ways. Another aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor in the school is often forgotten even though it is essential. The career guidance counsellor is the only trained member of staff to whom a vulnerable child with mental health difficulties or family difficulties can turn. I respectfully request that when the Minister is reviewing this area, he should not confine his considerations to the career advice aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor but should also pay attention to the counselling aspect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In subhead B, under the heading of skills development, there is an estimated substantial surplus for the national training fund, NTF. A review is being undertaken on the structure and direction of the NTF. Will the Minister indicate when that review will be completed and the impact it may have on the national training fund surplus? Under the equality budgeting and performance indicators, I am looking at the number of female apprentices. The output target for 2018 is 300 which is up from an output target of 145 last year. Did we reach the target of 145 last year and are we on track to meet the target of 300 for this year?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I raised the issue of female apprentices.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Minister does not have it now, is it possible to forward to us information on whether the target of 145 for female apprentices was reached last year? I understand the Minister might not have the information to hand but I am interested in it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the increase in the allocation for higher education in subhead C4, but the fact remains it is simply not quite enough to address the needs of the higher education sector. With regard to subhead C11 on student grants and support, despite an overall increase in the budget attributed to the higher education sector this year, there has been a fall in the funding allocation under subhead C11 with regard to student support. Why is this the case? Last week in the Dáil, along with other Deputies, I raised the fact that the lack of investment in student support is resulting in third level institutions pushing more and more of the burden onto students. We saw this recently in the Trinity protests with regard to supplemental examination fees. Only today we have seen that next year, the privately owned Shanowen Square in DCU will charge up to €9,000 for nine months' accommodation. It is not right and something needs to be done because the students are feeling too much of a burden because of a lack of investment and they are being forced to carry the cost.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My question is on the provision of physical education facilities in schools. I welcome the introduction of physical education as a leaving certificate subject. I find it remarkable, however, that not one request by a secondary school to build or operate a sports hall has been approved. How is a school expected to deliver PE at leaving certificate level on an equal footing with another school if it simply does not have a PE hall? A school in my constituency, Dublin-Rathdown, opened its doors in 1980 but, almost 40 years later, it still does not have a PE hall. How many second-level schools do not have PE halls? I have asked this question before. I do not get a direct answer to parliamentary questions. I am told that if a school does not have a hall, there are facilities for it in the community. The school in my constituency is a DEIS school and it cannot afford to hire a bus to go to a community centre or swimming pool. It should not have to use part of its double period of 80 minutes to do that. It is not putting the school on a level footing with others. I presume that, in the pilot programme the Department is running with 80 schools, at least one school with no PE hall is included so the Department can monitor and evaluate the fairness of the system. How is it fair that schools do not have PE halls? How will that work in terms of rolling out the new PE subject? Has one of the schools with no PE facilities been chosen for the pilot programme so that it might be evaluated? This needs to be done in order to ensure the fairness of the system. I just do not know how it works. It is not fair on teachers or students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The new pilot programme for PE will consist of 80 schools. Can the Minister confirm whether all of those schools have a PE hall? It would be useful if the Department compared the educational experiences of children who attend schools that have a PE hall with a school or schools that have no PE hall. I ask the Department to make that comparison. In advance of the official roll out of the new subject to all of the second level schools, will his Department conduct an audit so we can establish the exact number of second level schools that do not have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Minister saying that a school in my constituency, for example, will be unable to execute the programme because it does not have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would a school need to already have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is the point I made, Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will schools be audited?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the Department conduct an audit to see which schools have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I nominate Deputy Thomas Byrne.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is the first time we have done it that way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In fairness, it is the first time we have ever done it that way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was waiting for the Minister to finish.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have not agreed with it. The Acting Chairman is completely changing the way in which the Select Committee on Education and Skills is run.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We might discuss this issue in private session, but I raised my hand at the exact same time as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and as high as she did-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assumed the Acting Chairman would see me doing so.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will leave the matter of the way the meeting is being run and others until we go into private session, but I request that we be given time to discuss them. I thank the Minister for his statement. As we are dealing with the programme that covers salaries, I will call out the elephant in the room - pay inequality. I am aware of the ruling of the European Court of Justice in recent weeks. I would say the Government was pleased with it. On the issue of age discrimination, it indicated that it was based more on the date of entry into a position, but that is a technicality when we all know that the vast majority of new entrants are young people. It is young teachers who are continually being sold out. The arrangement worked out by the Government in September which will take effect soon does not address the fundamental underlying issue, that is, the concept of equal pay for equal work. Unlike his predecessor, I ask the Minister to recognise that principle. Yesterday I read with interest the news of the job-sharing scheme for teachers. Perhaps it is a necessary move, but it fundamentally misses the point as to why over 90% of schools are struggling to recruit teachers. The reason is pay discrimination. One cannot have partial equality, which is what seems to be envisioned by the Government's approach. One cannot have a situation where everyone is equal but some are more equal than others. That is how young teachers feel. Therefore, I really urge the Minister to commit to recognising the principle of equal pay for equal work. Recruitment and retention are issues because of the cost facing graduates of pursuing a two-year professional master's in education degree.They are also a problem because of the working conditions, the initiative overload, with document after document and change after change coming in, the quality of resources, the facilities in the schools, the need for a supplementary panel and, needless to say, the class sizes. Another point is the superannuation section under this heading. In recent years we have approved substantial Supplementary Estimates every year to deal with unexpected expenditure and every year we bring this up. Has the Minister managed to sort out this anomaly? I would be grateful if he would provide an update on plans to develop a sustainable superannuation forecasting and funding model and a timeline for its completion. Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Thomas Byrne brought up the issue of PE halls. I know the Minister said he was conscious of the fact that there is weak infrastructure. I would like a little more light shed on this because since my election to the Dáil, I have asked for an audit of all schools so we can establish exactly how many schools do not have PE halls. However, every time I table this question there is a refusal to answer it. Yes, there is one in my constituency but there are others. I just do not understand how PE can be rolled out fairly and equally when there are students without PE halls, so I ask again for that audit. I welcome the funding being allocated to well-being, following our own report on positive mental health in schools, including the funding for ten additional education psychologists. Does the Minister have plans to increase these numbers in the future? Finally, while the Minister is here, I wish to bring up the recent call for geography to be restored as a core subject in the junior cycle curriculum. I welcome that he is reviewing the dropping of history. I really plead with him to review the decision to remove geography as a core subject too. We have students outside Leinster House every Friday. We have a movement for climate strike across the world led by Greta Thunberg on 15 March. Our students get it. Geography is crucial in educating our students on one of the most urgent issues facing humankind, and it is shocking that this Government would move to remove geography as a core subject. I ask the Minister to reconsider, as he did with history, the removal of geography and to please restore it as a core subject.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Towards equality.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	How many second level schools in Ireland do not have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Minister want to close the door on a review?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister is not shutting the door on it. I would appreciate if he would say that he is not shutting the door on it. It is very important for our students. The Minister spoke about the people he met on the street talking about history and 2016. In view of everything that has happened around the world, and apart from climate change, where we situate ourselves as a country and the context of everything that is happening around us, it is essential. The Minister will hear those conversations as well. If he hears them, is he open to a review?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister should listen to the conversations that are happening every Friday on Kildare Street outside Leinster House among our students. They have had the opportunity to study geography as a core subject and they are very well informed on what is happening around the world. I ask the Minister to listen to our students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In November 2018, the number of female apprentices surpassed the 2018 target, which was 300. It stood at 323. This is good news and very welcome. I would be grateful if the Minister will comment on how this came about. What plans does he have to reach the ambitious target for 2019 to double this and bring the number of female apprentices up to 600? The increase in the national training fund levy is maintaining a substantial surplus that will go to the human capital initiative from next year until 2024. I appreciate that this is still a year away, and Brexit will occur between now and then, but does the Minister have information on how exactly the initiative will operate?On subhead 5, SOLAS and further education grants, the number of apprentices and trainees has doubled since 2016 from 6,000 to over 12,000, yet the combined allocation has only increased by 9%. Can the Minister elaborate on this?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We see a scenario where the amount spent on higher level education is not enough to sustain the sector and it is reaching crisis point. The State currently spends just over half of what it spent in 2008 on each full-time student equivalent. We are only two years away from the Cassells report's first major benchmark in 2021, which is the requirement to provide an additional €600 million in annual spending from 2015 to 2021 to bring the overall spending up to €2.4 billion. We still await an economic analysis on the report. How does the Minister plan to deal with the impending funding gap? Many institutions are already experiencing the consequences, which will only get worse until action is taken. Subhead C16 refers to capital expenditure. The increase of more than 200% in the funding allocation over the past year is welcome. To which projects will this funding be allocated? I ask the Minister to elaborate on the allocation. On the equality budgeting objectives for the Athena SWAN award, what percentage of all State funded third level institutes are involved? How many or what percentage of them applied? What measures are being taken to promote the award? What percentage of school leavers have disabilities? Is there a disparity in the percentage leaving school and those going on to third level? What is the current percentage of women in senior academic roles?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Did we not deal with the issue as part of subhead B?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to Athena SWAN, there is reference to eight State-run institutions. What is the percentage of this of all State-funded institutions?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What is being done to promote it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister. I meant to thank him as I received the answers to the questions he did not get to answer on his previous appearance before the committee. I appreciate him following through on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Subheads A3 to A6 concern teachers’ salaries. What is very notable about these Estimates is that this is the first time since I have been elected that we have not been dealing with substantial overexpenditure on superannuation, as has been the case in recent years. I presume the Department has managed to get the issue under control. Subheads A3 to A6 relate to a Supplementary Estimate ask of more than €50 million for teachers' salaries across primary and post-primary levels. While the subheads are extremely large and make up the majority of the expenditure for the entire Vote, the Supplementary Estimate as a percentage of the total is quite small. The amount in question is still remarkable, however. I understand this is primarily as a result of substitute cover for more paid leave than was anticipated. Does the same issue arise in the same way under each subhead? What measure is the Minister pursuing to calculate more accurately in this regard next year? With regard to subhead A9, on school transport, adequate school transport is an essential part of ensuring equality of access to education for all students, especially those with special educational needs. My question on the subhead is more about the future. What is the Minister's projection for spending on school transport in the future? Will he outline what engagement he has had with Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to mitigate against the rising cost of school transport? Ensuring sustainable, clean, effective transport is not just an issue for the Department of Education and Skills because there should be joined-up thinking. Public consultation on BusConnects closed this week. Revision of the bus network is crucial in Dublin. I welcome the engagement there has been on this and some of the changes over the past year. I noticed that, with regard to the major routes, peak times are identified as being from 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. onward. In some cases, school finishing times are not treated as peak times. I noted this in my submissions to BusConnects last year and this year. Rather, the focus is on the slot from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. Did the Minister have any engagement in the process or with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on how our bus and other public transport services need to be working for students and on how school finishing times need to be regarded as peak times so we can have adequate service options for students? What engagement has there been to ensure safe routes for cycling and walking to schools? These are required, especially in urban areas. Regarding subhead A11, additional expenditure pertaining to the State Examinations Commission is due to the High Court decision on appeals related to the leaving certificate examinations and the need to process them in a much shorter timeframe. I absolutely welcome the fact that action has been taken on this matter. Is the cost incurred to ensure the new system is implemented just a once-off cost? Will the increased expenditure be necessary every single year? Is there any mitigation activity that could be engaged in with a greater amount of planning next year? On subhead A15, concerning primary and post-primary infrastructure, the overexpenditure seems to be related entirely to current expenditure. It is €8 million over the projected budget of €19 million. This is quite substantial. Is the expenditure primarily on rent? Is it due to an increase in rent or an increase in the number of properties being rented? If both, could we have a rough breakdown? It brings into question something I have raised before with the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton. Is the Department announcing schools without even having sites identified? This causes a dilemma for principals, teachers, and parents who are trying to work out where students will be placed. A few years ago, a school in my constituency was moved from place to place as it sought a permanent solution. A primary school was moved to a secondary school. A cost was incurred to make the premises suitable for a primary school. I am aware of a school in Wicklow where the same thing is going to happen next September. A primary school that is no longer fit for purpose has a new building built for it. A secondary school is now going to be moved out of its temporary location to this primary school as another temporary location until the other one, the permanent location, is found. It has to be fitted to be made suitable as a second level school. What are the costs incurred in the circumstances? Are they included in these figures? I am curious about the cost. Subhead C4, which pertains to higher education, is quite specific in regard to medical students and the High Court ruling, as the Minister said in his statement. My only comment on this subhead concerns the chronic underexpenditure over recent years. In 2008, State funding for third level education was just under €9,000 per student. It is not much higher than €5,000 per student 11 years later. Our higher education institutions are in financial crisis. I feel the Government has continually delayed in engaging on the Cassells report. This committee has pointed this out several times. All the time, third level institutions are crippled by financial strain, and the education of their students is suffering. We are at a stage at which we are required to meet the first benchmark of the Cassells report. We are to be annually €600 million over and above the 2015 level by 2021. We are at a standstill, however. I urge the Minister to take on the task of recognising the crisis at third level and to fund this vital sector adequately. Every year, I take the opportunity as a former teacher to talk about equal pay for equal work. This is a major issue. I taught alongside teachers who were doing the same job as me and getting different pay. This needs to be dealt with as a matter of fairness. We need to value our educators right across the board. That is not happening in the jobs they do.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The peak-only routes do not include the very busy time after school has finished. That needs to be identified so extra buses are available. The Minister knows what it is like at the end of a school day.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	One suggestion is for the Minister to talk to his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and reconsider the current investment of 2% of the entire transport budget on walking and cycling when the UN states that it should be 20%. That could be a starting point to help make our roads safe for cyclists and pedestrians. The Minister should also engage with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A secondary school in a temporary location in Bray has to move again to another temporary location. It is a secondary school moving to a primary school premises that is not fit for purpose. The primary school has moved on and the premises has to be fitted out. The reverse happened in my constituency where the school in question finally secured planning permission. I see it happening again in Bray. What is the annual cost of fitting out schools?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Where a school is being moved from site to site and a primary school is being refitted to suit a secondary school, can something be done? That is undesirable. It is a nightmare for a principal but it would ease that nightmare if the refit of the school could be done before the summer holidays. That seems to be an issue. The school in this case is getting word but those involved still do not know what the new school will be like. They are working up until the date of the new term, whether it is the end of August or September, but they still do not know what is happening. It is difficult when the staff are gone. Is there some way of speeding up that process?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The need to extend tenants' rights to students has become clearer in recent years, as everyone will agree. Amendment No. 7 aims to include private purpose-built student accommodation within the coverage of the 2004 Act in order that students have access to the same protections as other renters. We are happy to withdraw this amendment because we welcome that the Government has put forward amendments to the Bill. The bipartisan, positive work that is being done in this committee in this regard is great. I reserve the right to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“Amendment of sections 3 and 4 of Act of 2004 – inclusion of student accommodation3. (1) Section 3(1) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the insertion of “including private purpose built student accommodation” after “dwelling,”.(2) Section 4(1) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the deletion of paragraph (g).”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No. I am withdrawing it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“Amendment of section 5 of Act of 2004 – definition of deposit3. Section 5 of the Act of 2004 is amended in subsection (1) by the insertion of the following definitions—“ ‘deposit’ means a sum of money held (whether by the landlord or otherwise) as security for the performance of the tenant’s obligations arising under or in connection with a lease or tenancy agreement;‘key money’ means any sum of money demanded by way of fine, premium, foregift, reimbursement of expenses, administration charges, or otherwise as consideration for the grant, continuance, extension, variation, or renewal of a tenancy agreement, or for consent to the surrender or disposition of the tenant’s interest under a tenancy agreement or to a subletting by the tenant; but does not include any sum payable or paid by way of rent or deposit;”.”.Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 have been recommended by Threshold to address the fact that there are no protections for deposits in legislation. Amendment No. 8 seeks to insert a definition of "deposit" in the Residential Tenancies Act. While the Act mentions deposits and imposes some obligations regarding them, it does not contain a definition. This has allowed a lacuna to develop in regulation. Amendment No. 9 on the regulation of deposits restricts the growing practice of landlords seeking two months in rent as a deposit along with the first month's rent. I am sure the Minister is aware of this. It is a sizable amount for any tenant to produce, and vulnerable, low-income tenants in particular. The Irish Times and many other newspapers have reported that some of the country's largest private landlords are seeking two months' rent in deposit. The common practice regarding deposits is that they be the equivalent of one month's rent. This practice would be placed on a legislative basis by this amendment. Amendment No. 9 would also prohibit the requirement of "key money", which we have defined in amendment No. 8. Key money is the money that prospective tenants are required to pay before they get the key to the property. It is also known as viewing fees or non-refundable booking fees for the viewing of properties. While those who can afford these extra costs might just find them tedious or an annoyance or inconvenience, key money is a real concern, poses a material obstacle to accessing housing and introduces further discrimination on the basis of wealth into the already stressful process of searching for housing. In effect, it is locking people out of even viewing accommodation that they badly need.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister is not accepting amendment No. 8 despite there being no definition of deposit. That is regrettable. There is a housing crisis so should address anything that is locking anyone out of even the possibility of viewing a home. There is also the issue of a two or three month's rent being requested as a deposit. I am hearing about those issues in my constituency in Dublin-Rathdown. I am being contacted by people who cannot even view a home because of the "key money" fee and by people who cannot afford the deposit because it is two or three month's rent. I appeal to the Minister to examine this again before the Bill goes on to Report Stage rather than give an outright refusal now. "Key money" fees and two or three month's rent being required for a deposit is essentially facilitating discrimination on the grounds of wealth. There should be no discrimination and there should be equality when accessing houses. Allowing a landlord to state it is necessary to have a deposit of two or three month's rent or to have key money to even see a home is locking people out of housing when we are in the midst of a housing crisis. I appeal to the Minister to revisit this before Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Chairman.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will speak on amendments Nos. 36 and 44 together, then Nos. 45 and 46 together and then on amendment No. 28 separately. Amendments Nos. 36 and 44 deal with an anomaly in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which allows for what is called the no reason eviction at the end of a four or six-year Part 4 tenancy. Currently, all Part 4 tenancies in Ireland, which are most private tenancies, must be renewed after six years or four years if one is in the property before 2016. Part 4 tenancies generally automatically continue and are considered rolling tenancies in terms of the amount of notice the landlord must give the tenant to vacate the property. However, when a Part 4 period comes to an end there is a window for the landlord to evict a tenant for no reason under section 34(b), a power which amendment No. 44 deletes. Rebuilding Ireland contains a commitment to move towards indefinite tenancies and our amendment simply places that in legislation. The time for doing so is long past. Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 refer to eviction due to sale of buy-to-let or investment properties. It is simply unnecessary to allow eviction on the grounds of sale. It should not be happening. In European countries with established private rental sectors with strong security of tenure sale is not permitted as a ground to evict. The same is even true in the UK, which has a similar private rented sector legislative structure to ours. However, I am willing to withdraw those amendments and to table something similar on Report Stage. Amendment No. 28 is not in this group.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Minister willing to give it some consideration before Report Stage?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I also have concerns about the BER because of the lack of a high minimum grade. That allows scope for abuse. It is very easy to fluctuate by two grades. What measures has the Minister developed to ensure changing grades are monitored correctly and certified? Will certification be overseen by the RTB alongside the SEAI? I will discuss it later since amendment No. 28 addresses it but I ask the Minister to give further consideration to that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 28 seeks to improve how the Bill addresses BER by requiring it to be improved by at least three grades, bringing the dwelling to a minimum of a C1 rating. I am aware of what the Minister is proposing in amendment No. 25. Requiring a minimum of two grades would not involve extensive change and a landlord could fluke an increase like that with very little change. BER can even improve on its own since grading was different 12 years ago due to the intensity of fossil fuels in our energy system. I ask the Minister to give it further consideration and strengthen it. I think it is open to abuse. I know amendment No. 25 is tied in with others. I hope to get this right and am looking for this to be increased by at least three grades, to bring the dwelling to a minimum of a C1 rating.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith anseo inniu chun labhairt faoi Mheastacháin Athbhreithnithe na Roinne nua do 2020. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee on the 2020 Further Revised Estimates for Vote 33 - tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sports and media. I will take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Niamh Smyth on her new role as Chair of the committee. She hails from the constituency I grew up in of Cavan–Monaghan so I am delighted to see someone from that constituency in this role. I know from our previous Dáil term how active a spokesperson she was on this and how familiar she is with the brief on a personal level. I wish her well. The original 2020 Revised Estimates for Vote 33 were passed by the Dáil in July of this year. These Estimates, however, relate to the then configuration of the Vote - culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht. A Further Revised Estimate was necessary for 2020 to give effect to the transfer of functions and resources from and to the Vote to reflect new roles and responsibilities. Responsibility for heritage matters has substantially transferred to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and all matters relating to the islands have transferred to the Department of Rural and Community Development. My Department has assumed responsibility for all matters related to tourism, sport and media. I am pleased to speak to the committee today with regard to tourism, culture, arts and media while my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, will address matters related to sport and the Gaeltacht.  The Covid-19 pandemic has utterly changed the landscape of the sectors for which I have responsibility as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. There has been a collapse in international tourism which the OECD estimates will be in the order of 80%. The impact of social distancing measures and the required limits on gatherings to protect public health has significantly diminished the domestic tourism and hospitality sectors.  Cultural venues and events were among the first to be closed on foot of the crisis and restrictions on social distancing and gatherings has had, and will continue to have, a devastating impact on performance opportunities, displays, festivals and concerts. The impact of the pandemic on the arts sector extends well beyond artists to include crews and the wide range of people it takes to put on live performances in venues and festivals. The sport sector has been directly impacted by the pandemic. Like the cultural sector, all sporting activity was suspended in March. Restrictions on attendances since activity resumed has severely impacted revenues and the commercial sports and leisure sectors have been severely curtailed by indoor gathering limits.  Across the Gaeltacht, businesses and communities alike have suffered a significant reduction in economic activity, tourism and educational visitors as a consequence of Covid-19. The media sector has been especially hard-hit in terms of reduced advertising revenue, in particular, while at the same time having to fulfil a critical role in public messaging around Covid-19. These sectors, individually and cumulatively, are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly, in rural and regional areas where they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being. Well-being is a core principal underpinning the living with Covid-19 plan and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the long term.  The need for important public health measures such as social distancing has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect health. This has had a devastating impact on these sectors given their public facing and audience-driven nature. I have worked tirelessly with Government colleagues to ensure that a range of measures have been introduced to help support the tourism, arts, culture, Gaeltacht and sport sectors including: a €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector; a €10 million grant for coach tourism; the "stay and spend" tax credit initiative; an additional €25 million in funding for the Arts Council; a €5 million live events pilot grant scheme; a €3 million TV drama fund; €6 million to support the national cultural institutions and nationwide arts infrastructure; an additional €8 million for Údarás na Gaeltachta; €40 million for the three main field sports bodies, namely, the GAA, IRFU and FAI; and a €15 million resilience fund for sports governing bodies and clubs. The universal income supports of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme have also been critical in supporting all sectors through this crisis and the extension of both of these schemes has been important in this regard. The 2020 Further Revised Estimates for my Department, which are under consideration today, reflect the additional funding and measures secured to support these sectors and ensure that as we begin to emerge from the shadow of Covid-19 we will have a vital tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, a dynamic sports and media sector and a landscape in which our language and our engagement with it can continue to grow and flourish. When account is taken of all additional funding allocated in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including funding awarded as part of the July job stimulus, a gross provision of €1.003 billion is available to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in 2020. An additional €32.9 million in funding has been carried over from the 2019 capital provision for expenditure and priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures. In broad terms, the 2020 breakdown of allocations to the Vote is as follows: €148.4 million for tourism services, including €22.9 million in additional funding to deal with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic; just over €251 million for arts and culture, including an allocation of €105 million for the Arts Council, an increase of 31% on its 2019 allocation of €80 million as well as an additional funding of €5 million for a live events pilot scheme and €3 million for a new TV drama fund; just under €72 million for the Gaeltacht, including an additional €8 million for Údarás na Gaeltachta; €217 million for sports and recreational services, including €40 million for the three main field sports bodies, namely, the GAA, IRFU and FAI, a €15 million resilience fund for sport governing bodies and clubs and €15 million to provide for the GAA, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, LGFA, and the Camogie Association to stage the 2020 football, hurling and camogie championships; and €278.5 million for media and broadcasting, including an additional €2 million in respect of the broadcasting fund. While the Department did not exist in its current configuration in 2019, a broad comparison of the comparable programme allocation indicates that the 2020 allocations are 25% higher than in 2019 reflecting my commitment, and that of Government, to support these vital yet vulnerable sectors as they navigate their way through the current Covid-19 crisis. This increased funding is targeted at a number of key initiatives. In the case of the tourism programme, the 2020 allocation is some 14% higher than the comparable figure for 2019 and includes additional funding of €10 million to Fáilte Ireland towards a business adaptation scheme to allow the hospitality sector to adapt and reconfigure to comply with restrictions and a further additional €10 million for coach tourism. The tourism recovery task force which was established in May has recently presented its recommendations which will help inform the development of a recovery plan for this important sector. Funding for the arts and culture programme has increased by one third to just over €251 million. As Minister, I am acutely conscious of the devastating impact of the current crisis on this sector.I recently established an arts and culture recovery task force and look forward to working with its members to develop a roadmap to recover the viability of the sector. The 2020 allocation includes just under €56 million made available to the sector specifically to address the most severe impacts of this unprecedented crisis. An allocation of €278.5 million is available in 2020 for the media and broadcasting programme, representing an increase of 5% over the comparable figure for 2019. The media sector has a critical role to play in communicating the public messaging around Covid-19, and it is vital that we continue to support it in pursuit of this to the greatest extent possible. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs and sport, Deputy Chambers, will speak to the Gaeltacht and sports programmes of Vote 33.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The 2020 allocation of €1.003 billion for the Vote of the Department with responsibility for media, tourism, arts, culture, sport and the Gaeltacht will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its diverse but critical work programme. Both my officials and I are in regular contact with stakeholders and representatives in all of the sectors for which I have responsibility, and their views and recommendations will inform any refinement of existing supports or introduction of new supports, as required. As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to ensure these sectors remain viable and resilient as we continue to deal with the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. I am happy to take any questions Deputies may have in respect of the 2020 Further Revised Estimates for my Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Chairperson knows, the task force was set up recently and is chaired by Ms Clare Duignan. It held its first meeting two weeks ago. It is due to report on 31 October, but at the first meeting, I asked the members of the task force to identify key priorities that would feed into the budget. I received those last week and they are helping me in negotiations for budget allocations. There is ongoing communication with the officials and chair of the task force. The report is expected at the end of the month.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Speed is of the essence when it comes to supporting our culture and arts sectors.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I brought that report before Cabinet yesterday. The key recommendations in the report relate to survival, recovery and stabilisation. The measures in the document will apply for three years so it is an ongoing process that will need oversight of its implementation. I met the tourism and recovery task force for its final meeting this morning. I will not have the negotiations here but I have consistently voiced the supports that the members of the task force and stakeholders have said are needed. I have brought them to the attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath. I will meet them again this week to discuss same. The document is essential for budget allocations and the national economic plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I hope I can address all of the issues raised but if not I ask members to talk to me afterwards. Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan mentioned that some people in the tourism area felt the support was a small boost that only lasted for a short period during the summer. I am very aware of how difficult business has been and the decision to move to level 3 across the country has made it much more difficult. That is why the tourism recovery report and the engagement with stakeholders is key. I vigorously advocate for the tourism sector, especially in the context of the budget. On another issue that the Deputy raised yesterday, I am very conscious of the challenges facing workers in the arts sector. I am happy to liaise with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, on the issue. In response to Deputy Munster, the carryover expenditure is normal when money is simply carried from one year to the next. If she needs technical details, I will revert to her and get my officials to contact her. On Tourism Ireland, we will keep Ireland's presence in our key markets that have the best chance of recovery. The July stimulus included €10 million for the adaptation fund, which now stands at €26 million, in addition to the €20 million for product development. Some 2.8 million people are eligible for the stay-and-spend scheme, which is a demand generation initiative. It will be reviewed as it is challenged by changes in levels. Deputy Mattie McGrath and another Deputy mentioned the pandemic unemployment payment. I am very conscious that the changes in the PUP scheme and the employment wages subsidy scheme affect the lives of thousands of artists and workers in the culture, arts and live entertainment sectors. I understand that these supports are needed now more than ever. I have raised these matters with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of the budget. I recognise that there will be a long and extended period in which we will have to live with the virus. That presents difficulties for this sector because of the people-facing nature of performance. These supports are important now more than ever. We should not see performance as a luxury, but as an absolute essential because culture, arts and music define us as a people. We are talking about people's livelihoods. We rely on performers for the societal well-being of the nation. As I come from that background, I am conscious of the well-being of performers and their need to earn a living. Performers need to perform and feed off an audience. That is why my Department developed the pilot live performance scheme worth €5 million, in consultation with the sector. The scheme has been inundated with applications to the value of €15 million. We did the pilot scheme before the budget because we felt the scheme would be well received. Performers have seen merit in the scheme. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment for artists, creative technicians and support staff. It also seeks to carry the risk of planning and performances. I have a copy of the report and I am happy to supply the report to the Deputy who asked for it. If other Deputies want it then I am quite happy to share it with them too. I will get copies to them.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Cuirim fáilte mhór roimh an deis labhairt leis an Roghchoiste um Thurasóireacht, Cultúr, na hEalaíona, Spórt agus na Meáin agus Meastachán Athbhreithnithe breise €1.092 billiún do 2021 á mheas le haghaidh Vóta 33 do réimsí clár A, B, D agus E. Táim an-sásta glacadh leis an seans chun sonraí a sholáthar faoi na bearta suntasacha a n-éascaíonn an maoiniú méadaithe seo chun na hearnálacha a bhfuil freagracht orm ina leith a thacú agus a neartú. Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt leis an gcoiste maidir le príomh-thosaíochtaí mo Roinne agus an fhís a leagan amach do na hearnálacha luachmhara fairsinge seo. Cuireann na hearnálacha seo go mór le geilleagar na tíre, agus tacaíonn siad le folláine an duine aonar agus an pobal ar fud na hÉireann chomh maith. The diverse range of sectors served by my Department have been among those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing many hundreds of thousands right across the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy time together and when local communities and businesses flourish. All of them, however, have been dreadfully impacted by the restrictions imposed on our society during the pandemic. Large parts of these sectors will be among the last to return to full operations as the country reopens. Our cultural institutions and theatres, tourism destinations, hospitality businesses, sporting occasions, Gaeltacht communities and local media have endured great challenges since March of last year, yet these are the very sectors that have brought us light through the dark times and it has been demonstrated that without question, they are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being. I am deeply conscious of the effects that measures taken in the interests of public health have had on businesses, in particular the hundreds of thousands of workers whose ability to make a living has been excruciatingly curtailed and for so long. We should also recognise that these tough decisions have enabled all of us through collective action to protect the most vulnerable in our society and with the ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme, we now find ourselves positioned where we can start to move on from the pandemic and focus our efforts on economic and social recovery. Over the coming months, as the restrictions continue to ease and the vaccine programme continues its roll-out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society and with it, our tourism sector, arts and culture venues and events and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds. The 2021 Further Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives. The additional funding is providing for a strong suite of significant measures as a robust and targeted response to this crisis. It it will support resilience and recovery and ensure that Ireland can prosper once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport and linguistic heritage. These sectors, individually and cumulatively, are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas where they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being. Well-being is a core principle underpinning the living with Covid plan and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term. Total 2021 funding for the sectors supported by my Department is as follows. There will be €220.9 million for tourism services, including a €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector. These measures are complementary to the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support schemes and the restart scheme. Thus far, three phases of the tourism business continuity schemes have been launched aimed at improving the competitiveness and viability of businesses in the sector. I also launched a €17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme being delivered in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities across the country. This scheme is providing funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their own outdoor seating capacity and is providing funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres similar to those that exist in various European cities. In addition, the tourism sector has been able to avail of cross-Government supports, including the reduction in the VAT rate, which was recently extended to September 2022; the Covid restrictions support scheme and the rates waiver extension, representing a significant cross-Government response to the existential impact of Covid-19. Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2021 is €341 million, an increase of 74% compared with the initial allocation in budget 2020. The additional funding provides for a 2021 allocation of €130 million for the Arts Council, an increase of 24% on 2020. This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations come through this crisis and play their part in the national recovery. Significant support is also being provided for live entertainment in the amount of €50 million. This funding has allowed for €25 million to fund a new live performance support scheme, €14 million for a new support scheme for live entertainment businesses, €5 million to support local authorities for outdoor live performances, €5 million capital supports for the live entertainment sector and €1 million to fund the St. Patrick's Festival. There is provision for €8 million to facilitate the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall. This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling the orchestra to be established as a world-class orchestra that will, with the National Concert Hall, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. The audiovisual industry was been one of the success stories of 2020, with on-screen success in the form of "Normal People" but also its track record in maintaining output in the face of Covid-19. I am, therefore, very pleased to be able to increase Screen Ireland’s funding by €6 million to €30.1 million in 2021. Funding of €280.5 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2021 in recognition of the critical communication role of this sector during the current crisis. An additional €3.5 million is being provided to TG4 and the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall outlined earlier will also have reciprocal benefits for RTÉ and is evidence of the synergies that can be brought to bear with the culture and broadcasting and media sectors now part of the same brief. I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2021 of €1.092 billion allows for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes. As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to ensure that as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, we will have a world-renowned tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, a dynamic sports and media sector and a landscape in which our language and our engagement with it can continue to grow. I thank the committee and I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Further Revised Estimate for 2021 as it relates to sport.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I apologise for the interruption. Deputy Munster asked about additional funding and there is the €220.9 million for tourism services. For Fáilte Ireland there was €50 million extra and €5 million carried over. That was support for strategic tourism businesses, with €5 million for training and digitisation support for the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thought the Deputy asked about Fáilte Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay. Fáilte Ireland got €50 million extra.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can get that figure for the Deputy but I just have the Fáilte Ireland figure for now. I will revert to Deputy Munster if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy has recognised, some of those issues are for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, to address. However, he rightly pointed out the importance of marketing the establishment of connectivity to make it very clear that Ireland has reopened. We are very much moving into that space from next week. Tourism Ireland launched a new €3.5 million promotional campaign on 7 June. Phase 1 of that involves a major digital video campaign, which went live from 7 June with the slogan, "Let's get back to Ireland". That is definitely the message we want. We hope that online video will build anticipation for holidays in Ireland this summer. From my engagement with Tourism Ireland, it is quite clear that there is pent-up demand to come here and we are tapping into that. Tourism Ireland also hopes to launch the next phase of the campaign in the coming weeks in line with Government plans for the reopening of international travel. This will deliver a very clear "book now" message to prospective international visitors and will single-mindedly drive visitor numbers back to Ireland. It is clearly stated in the national economic recovery plan that supports will remain in place for sectors as they need them. We are acutely aware that more supports will be needed after the summer period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was removed from the meeting for part of the Deputy's question and so just got the tail end of it. I do not know what happened but I had to rejoin.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is no accounting error. That €50 million was hard fought for and I can guarantee that no sector will receive any cuts. The focus is completely on extra funding and that is what was achieved in the budget. Unprecedented funding, for the first time, of €50 million for the events and commercial music sectors brought total funding of the Arts Council to €130 million. There is no accounting error.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There was additional funding on a one-off basis in 2020. The €50 million funding in 2021 is additional to that in 2020.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There has been no formal feedback yet. I presume we will get it. The scheme has been very well received. One positive out of all this is that the reopening of outdoor dining and activity is reimagining our cities and many areas in rural Ireland, including those the Chair represents in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. It is breathing life into our towns and villages, which is a positive. The only feedback I have received has been through personal interaction, where the scheme has been very well received.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Arts Council funding has made a significant difference in helping to sustain artists and organisations. I am very conscious of that as we move into budget 2022 negotiations. I thank the Deputy and Chair for their kind words. I am very aware of the difference the funding has made as I go into these negotiations. As I have said, the film industry that has managed to do very well under awful circumstances. In budget 2021, Screen Ireland was allocated an additional €9 million over and above its 2020 allocation. This increased funding has helped to address significant levels of feature film production delay and will assist with costs relating to the implementation of health and safety protocols. Much of the groundwork for the success of the audiovisual sector in Ireland was laid in recent years, for example through the launch of the audiovisual action plan in 2018. The budget 2021 announcements addressed two key elements of that action plan: the regional film development uplift, which will see the enhanced tax credit of 5% in place for an additional year, and the announcement that work will now commence on the development of a tax credit for the digital gaming sector. Again, I am acutely aware, but it is no harm saying it on this platform, that this funding has made a difference. I am aware of that as I go into the budget negotiations. I place a high value on both sectors.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Work is ongoing on the transfer of the orchestra. Money is safely ring-fenced to facilitate that and work is ongoing for the successful transfer, which we all wish to see. It was hugely significant and important to get that funding ring-fenced.We have a working group with RTÉ, the National Concert Hall and the Department and will bring forward legislation. That money is safe and it is for that purpose and that purpose alone.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is €8 million for the transfer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, it is for the National Concert Hall. It is for the transfer of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	All that was ever stated was the €8 million.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There were criteria for applications to be deemed successful. A total of 237 applicants received funding under the €25 million scheme. That funding ranged from small to large venues, encompassed producers and promoters and supported live events in every county, including festivals, concerts, theatre productions, comedy and outdoor events. While there appears to have been talk of disappointment from certain counties, we would have to consider how many applications we actually received from them. Every county got a grant and we will keep that under review. Similar to tourism, I am aware of the impact that social distancing has had on this industry and its viability. In the national economic recovery plan, it is stated that the industry will remain supported. If the Chair has any specific queries, I ask her to bring them to my attention offline and I will be happy to talk to her about them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	At the moment, these pilot events are essential as part of the roadmap to full reopening. For example, the event in Iveagh Gardens was the first ever event after a period of complete closure. Even that was about the logistics of entry and exit, managing social distancing and how we are living with Covid. Things started at that basic level. As the Chair can see, things are moving further and further. It is essential that we have these events. A range of indoor and outdoor events are taking place across the country. Consideration is being given to further pilot events but the key factor in determining these events will be the need to generate data and the operational guidance to support the resumption of financially viable live performances. It is likely that live performance support scheme, LPSS, supported events may be considered for future pilot events in the coming weeks, as well as further events supported by the Arts Council.  Like the Chair and every member of the committee, we all want a return to an economically viable live performance as soon as possible. There are many reasons to be optimistic. The roll-out of the vaccination programme is the most important factor underpinning our hopes of what may be possible. This week at Cabinet, I notified my colleagues that I want further detailed advice on how we can get a return to live music at outdoor licensed premises and indoor licensed premises. I want that return to happen as soon as possible and notified my Cabinet colleagues of that. I am writing to seek that advice.  In terms of what it will take to reopen things safely, I want to know that and plan for and do it as soon as possible. Lead-in times are required. It is not as simple as pressing an on or off button and suddenly opening doors, as the Chair will know from her involvement in this sector. We are working on it. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is my understanding that it is all licence fee.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a detailed breakdown and I can get it to the Deputy without a problem.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think there was a €7.6 million carryover for Tourism Ireland. I will revert to the Deputy to confirm it, but I believe that is the figure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This may have been discussed during last week's Revised Estimates on the Gaeltacht.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Fáiltím go mór roimh an deis labhairt leis an gcoiste agus Meastacháin Athbhreithnithe 2022 do mo Roinnse á mbreithniú. Tá €1.2 billiún sa leithdháileadh iomlán do Vóta 33 in 2022, méadú de thart ar 8% ar an bhfigiúr inchomparáide do 2021. Éascóidh an maoiniú méadaithe seo sraith bearta substaintiúla chun na hearnálacha a bhfuil mé féin mar Aire freagrach astu a thacú agus a neartú agus iad ag dul in oiriúint don, agus ag teacht chucu féin ón, dochar nach bhfacthas riamh a d'eascair as paindéim Covid-19. These sectors are both wide-ranging and valuable and were among those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing many hundreds of thousands throughout the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together. Our cultural institutions and theatres, live performances, tourism destinations, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have all been severely impacted for almost two years. The public health measures necessitated by Covid enabled us to protect the most vulnerable in our society through our collective action but also had such a negative impact on the way we have lived our lives for the past two years, for example, our ability to watch a match, to attend a live performance, to enjoy a weekend away with friends, to participate in the arts as well as the ability of artists, workers and businesses to provide these uniquely valued experiences. As Minister, I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society and, with it, our tourism sector, our arts and culture venues and events, and the return of fans to our sports grounds. The 2022 Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives. The additional funding covers a wide range of initiatives and measures to support the resilience and growth of practitioners, businesses, communities and operations in the sectors overseen by my Department, with all efforts very much focused on both social and economic recovery. I will outline total 2022 funding for the sectors supported by my Department. There is €288.5 million in funding for tourism services in 2022, which is an increase of €67.6 million or 31% on the comparable 2021 allocation. This additional funding includes a €50 million provision for further business continuity support to help drive the sustainable recovery of the sector. A €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund will support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. In addition, €27 million
is allocated for a range of industry initiatives, including domestic marketing and festivals, investment in digital skills development, and staff retention, and €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development – an increase of almost €4 million over the 2021 allocation – for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.
Some €371.4 million
will be allocated to the arts and culture sector, including €25 million to pilot a new basic income guarantee scheme for artists. This measure was the key ask from the arts and culture recovery task force and will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector. The Arts Council maintains the record €130 million
funding
allocated in 2021, allowing it to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties and empowering it to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead. Some €50 million is allocated for further supports for the live performance sector following on from the successful operation of a number of schemes in 2021, including the live performance support scheme, LPSS, the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, and the events sector Covid support scheme, ESCSS, thereby supporting a successful return to full-scale performances.The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland is €36.7 million, an increase of more than €6.6 million on the 2021 allocation. The audiovisual industry has been one of the success stories of the past two years and this additional funding will ensure the continued success and growth of this internationally renowned industry into the future. Funding for this programme area includes the following: €4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force; €5 million in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality services to the public and deliver progress in their ongoing programme of investment; and €5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme delivering rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022. Funding of €295.7 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2022, which includes €5.5 million for the establishment of the new media commission and the appointment of an online safety commissioner to begin work on key issues following the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill in 2022. This allocation also provides for an increase of €4.2 million, the largest ever funding increase for TG4, bringing its annual funding for 2022 up to €44.9 million. This additional funding will allow it to deliver its ambitious post-Covid strategy, focusing on news content and putting audiences centre stage. In conclusion, I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2022 of €1.222 billion will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes. As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to continue to support all the sectors for which I have responsibility as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, and I look forward to their future growth and successes. I will now hand over to my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Revised Estimates for 2022 as they relate to sport.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is used to provide funding for overseas tourism marketing. The bulk of the funding forms the State's share of the agreed North-South co-funding of Tourism Ireland's destination marketing of the island of Ireland overseas. Given Tourism Ireland is a North-South body, it also receives funding from the Northern Ireland exchequer for its core overseas marketing. The primary objective of the tourism marketing fund is to increase tourism revenue by attracting more overseas visitors to Ireland. Irish tourism is marketed primarily on an island-of-Ireland basis and the majority of the tourism marketing fund goes toward Tourism Ireland's core funding for all-island overseas marketing activity. A proportion of the non-core tourism marketing fund is allocated for the development of Ireland's specific product and regional marketing by Fáilte Ireland, to be delivered by Tourism Ireland as its overseas agent.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism marketing fund is used to pay for Tourism Ireland's destination marketing overseas and for Fáilte Ireland's niche product marketing. Tourism Ireland delivers marketing programmes in 21 markets throughout the world and reaches a global audience of more than 600 million each year. The agency is doing incredible work and I have witnessed that in two missions I have undertaken, to the United States and, recently, to Dubai. The work it is doing to sell our island as a destination at a time when that is so badly needed is incredible, not least because of the time and commitment that is given to it. As an example of where the money goes, targeting market activity includes advertising online, on television, at outdoor sites, in cinemas, newspapers and magazines and through e-marketing, overseas publicity and co-operative marketing with carriers, other partners and promotions. I have heard from the main tour operators to which they are trying to sell Ireland that at a time of absolute devastation in those early days of the pandemic, it was Tourism Ireland that reached out to the tour operators when others did not, and kept that relationship really special and valued. They linked in with them and that is what is being remembered as tourism reopens. That is all down to the incredible work Tourism Ireland does.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. Fáilte Ireland is delivering four new regional tourism strategies in 2022, setting out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for each region. They will be activated through a series of local destination and experience development plans. By the end of 2022, 27 of them will be live, while by 2025, every part of the country will have a destination development plan. That should address some of the Deputy's concerns. Each plan will be appropriate to a given region's level of tourism maturity.The Deputy can look also at the incredible amount of funding provided by Fáilte Ireland last year to develop tourism attractions, for example, in Westport, Donegal, Dublin and Cavan. It was the largest funding ever announced by Fáilte Ireland, which is constantly working on developing new destinations and attractions for tourism and sharing tourism out.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The four new regional tourism strategies will be delivered in 2022. They will set out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for the regions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Where did Deputy Munster say it is?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is looking at the short-term letting. The National Tourism Development Authority legislation is to be updated to take account of the Housing for All requirements and to limit capital increases. It is looking at how that can help.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is to register Airbnb accommodation. The registration would be welcomed. My departmental officials are linking in with the officials of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Fáilte Ireland will develop, support and promote tourism at a regional and county level. The Vice Chairman mentioned one of the four regional tourism experiences. These are the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, the Hidden Heartlands and Dublin. Tourism Ireland is promoting the island of Ireland in more than 21 markets. Those four brands resonate with tourists, and they work very well. In terms of Fáilte Ireland-supported capital projects, although restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic may have delayed some openings, some examples of projects that were completed in recent years include the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny, the Blasket Islands viewing platform, which will open shortly, and Carlingford Castle. The work is ongoing. Fáilte Ireland allocated the sum of €1.1 million to the Butler Gallery; €1.7 million was allocated to the Blasket Islands viewing platform; Carlingford Castle got €400,000; Nowth in Meath, where I was last week, received €1.4 million; and the Céide Fields visitor centre in Ballycastle, County Mayo, received a Fáilte Ireland investment of €863,000. Some of the Fáilte Ireland tourism projects due to be opened during 2022 include the Blasket Islands, the Céide Fields, Avondale House, Strokestown Park, Mount Congreve House and Gardens and the Norman Heritage Park. We are constantly building on the regional spread. Much-needed investment is taking place.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a separate line this year for Covid supports under B16. Cultural supports now have their own separate line. It looks like the figure has dropped, but it has not. It is just that we have given a separate line now to the Covid supports. That was well spotted by the Deputy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In general terms, the lesson that has been learned by everyone, not just the Department, is the value of the arts. As an artist, Deputy Cannon will appreciate that. We have often spoken about the value of arts and how we treasure it, but it really came to light during Covid. A valuable lesson also is not just about the performers themselves, who of course are incredibly important, but also about the people who make these events happen - those who work backstage on whom the spotlight does not shine. A light was shone on them, and it is my intention to keep that light firmly there. We could not have designed the number of schemes we did without engagement. From the first moment I became Minister, engagement and feedback have been key. Schemes have been adjusted following engagement with those affected. Although we are emerging from Covid, I would not see that as something that should ever stop. It is essential that we continue to engage with the stakeholders through the forum that was set up to assess the recovery and their current needs. Yesterday, we announced another new scheme, which is about helping people with the recovery. That needs to continue. Such engagement is evident also in what we are doing with the basic income. The artists must shape what we do in the Department. As far as I am concerned, the artists must be involved and at the table in any policy initiatives. That is the lesson that has been learned.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Engaging with the artists shows how essential that basic income is. This was the number one recommendation that came from the artists themselves through the arts and culture recovery task force. I was absolutely delighted to secure agreement within the Government on that. I secured €25 million in budget 2022 to launch this three-year basic income for arts pilot scheme. The stakeholder engagement has been absolutely core. We had the stakeholder forum in December followed by public consultation. There were well over 1,000 pieces of feedback into that public consultation. As I said, we received a significant number of submissions. That reflects the high level of interest, which the Deputy talked about, in this key policy intervention. The scheme will be open to practising and developing artists and creative arts workers. It will be non-competitive. Therefore, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, he or she will be included in a randomised selection process. The eligibility criteria will be published as part of the scheme launch, which I hope to do in the coming weeks. We are nearly there. It was essential that the artists had to feed into this and help to shape it. I expect the launch in the coming weeks. We are now down to the final details of the number of recipients and the rate of payment. We are trying to finalise that right now. Of course, issues around artists with disabilities have been raised so we must give serious consideration to ensuring this is addressed. It is my intention that the basic income for arts will be an unconditional basic regular income to artists and creative arts workers to allow them to focus on what they need to focus on. The recipients can do that when they are in receipt of this grant. It will be groundbreaking. There will be a control group as well and we will be assessing the scheme. Research will be done throughout the programme on its impact on creative output and well-being. It will be a thorough research project for three years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier, the audiovisual industry was one of the success stories of 2021, recording a record level of output in the face of Covid-19. New figures published recently reveal a record-breaking spend of more than €500 million in the Irish economy across film, television, drama, documentary and animation production in Ireland in 2021. The Irish screen production industry is building a reputation for high-quality production across the world. The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland will amount to €36.743 million comprising €32.15 million in capital funding and €4.593 million in current funding. For screen allocations, there will be pay of €2.2 million and non-pay of €2.275 million with capital funding at €32.15 million. That €6.65 million will allow them to keep indigenous production levels at a pace that is consistent with previous years. That is where that is being targeted. It will enable the encouragement of more regional productions in the Irish language; continue the training academies, which build on the skill set that is needed; introduce a new funding stream to support documentary series; and a provide a further round of State funding to support Irish companies. That money will allow them to invest in IT and marketing and recruit key roles and talent such as a diversity and inclusion manager, a project manager, a development executive, an audience engagement executive, an IT executive and a HR executive. That is where the money will be targeted.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy is looking at arts organisations in receipt of funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	One aspect is what we were aiming for, and we actually went above that. The 2020 out-turn target was 1,146 organisations. The 2021 output target was 840 organisations and the 2022 output target is 895. The Department is currently in the process of collating the 2021 out-turns for performance metrics. All 2021 performance information will be available in the 2021 public service performance report, which is due to be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the end of this month. That is where we will gather that information.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Of the €50 million that was allocated for a suite of supports for the live entertainment industry, €5 million was allocated for the live performance support scheme, LPSS, strand 2. The Deputy might remember that this was to support pantomimes and seasonal musical theatre, which were brought to a halt due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in December and January. Of that, grants of €2.6 million have been offered and payments of €1.3 million have been made under the scheme to date. Up to €20 million has been allocated under strand 3 of the LPSS to support events that were due to be staged in December and January and were curtailed, cancelled or rescheduled due to the restrictions with live performances at 50% capacity and the closing time of 8 p.m. Grants of €7.7 million have been offered and payments of €1.1 million have been made under the scheme to date. Applications are being assessed on a rolling basis and grantees are advised of the status of their grants as soon as a decision is made. The payments are being made and issued on a rolling basis once grantees have supplied the Department with the required documentation. There is, therefore, ongoing liaison with my officials. There was €4 million allocated for another round of the music and entertainment business assistance scheme to support small music and entertainment businesses that do not operate out of a rateable premises. Some 642 applicants have received funding of €2.8 million. To date, €2.3 million has been awarded and payments of more than €900,000 have been made since the scheme closed on 27 February. There was €5 million allocated for local authorities under the live performance support scheme to support local artists and performances. A further €5 million was allocated to continue the capital support scheme, for example to help venues that might need ventilation upgrades or other Covid-19 adaptations. There was €1 million for the St. Patrick's festival. Yesterday, the live performance restart grant scheme was announced, which is a new scheme for businesses engaged in staging events in the arts and cultural live performance sector. We will continually assess what money goes out but that money will go where it needs to go, which is to the artists. As I said, that is through constant liaison with officials linking in with artists if further information is needed. It will go where it is meant to go, however, which is to support the artists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	People will have to apply. The scheme is really to support venues, promoters and producers and help them with the costs of reopening and hiring artists and crew to stage live performances in the coming months. It will trickle down.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To that end, all grantees will have to complete evaluation surveys on the exact purposes that for which the grants were applied.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I refer to producers, promoters and venues, including nightclubs with an established track record in producing live arts and cultural performances that are advertised as such. Existing grantees, who are fully compliant with their existing service level agreement and drawing down procedures, would be defined as LPSS pilot, LPSS 2021, LPSS 2, LPSS 3 or ESCSS stream A grantees in full compliance. The existing grantees are deemed to have already demonstrated their track record and there will be no need to demonstrate that again. If an applicant is a new entrant, that is, not an existing grantee, the applicant will have to be in a position to demonstrate either a proven track record of at least two years of delivering ticketed events in the arts and culture sector or VAT exclusive turnover generated in the State of at least €100,000 for 2018 and 2019. The business must also be in the State. There are details provided on how they would demonstrate their loss. That would probably answer Deputy Munster's question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are three streams to the scheme, namely, stream A, the existing grantees, which are those LPSS 2021 grantees; stream B, the LPSS ESCSS; and then the new entrants. The payment is up to a maximum of €100,000. It is not unusual to have a cap on the funding but, as I stated to Deputy Cannon, if demand exceeds the allocation, we will look at that. I have often stated that I will go back to the Covid contingency fund, which is where we secured an additional €25 million before Christmas. The idea is not to exclude people but to help as many as possible, up to the maximum of €100,000.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy is asking a hypothetical question. We do not know whether all the previous recipients will apply. The scheme is open to new entrants.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have not ring-fenced money for one section only. In everything I do, the Department is reaching as many people as possible. If the hypothetical scenario the Deputy presented emerges, we will reassess the matter. The idea is to get money out to those who need it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Within the €15 million allocation, I have not ring-fenced a certain amount for a certain group. I have not allocated a specific amount or provided that the majority of the funding will go to a certain group. It is open to everyone to apply for funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will assess the matter. To reassure the Deputy, there is no absolute entitlement and the scheme is open to everybody.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, has already discussed with the committee the Revised Estimates in that regard and has expressed that, as the Minister of State with responsibility for the matter, he is willing to attend the committee.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Vice Chairman has rightly identified that the section 481 tax relief is a vital part of the financial infrastructure of the audiovisual industry, as is the regional film development uplift. We are seven months out from the budget, so I will include this matter in my negotiations. This is a thriving industry and it can do much more. It helps with many other areas. I will be undertaking some trade missions with a view to developing more production in this country.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Different schemes were developed at different times throughout the pandemic. This scheme is about supporting people and has been designed to give them restart stability to ensure they can plan ahead. All applicants, existing and new, must be able to demonstrate their VAT exclusive turnovers and a proven track record of at least two years of delivering ticketed events in the arts and culture sector. If an applicant is a new entrant, he or she must be in a position to demonstrate that. Existing grantees are deemed to have already demonstrated their track records, so they will not have to do so again. The LPRGS was just announced yesterday. All grantees will have to complete the evaluation survey to demonstrate that the grants are reaching where they need to go. I am happy to forward the committee more information on comparing the schemes and how that comparison might impact on the LPRGS. What we were doing in the thick of Covid compared with what we are doing now to aid in the recovery process are quite different in design.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We engage with An Post all the time. I might be able to come back to the Deputy with the breakdown of funding afterwards, if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We engage with it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is an annual service level agreement, SLA, with An Post.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, of course. We set up the Future of Media Commission because there is an issue with the funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It comes up all the time. It has been well identified as an issue, not just in the annual SLAs, but more widely. That is why the Future of Media Commission was set up.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe it was €9.8 million in 2021.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We do not have the figure for 2022. The figure I gave is for 2021.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2020 it was €10 million, in 2019 it was €11.3 million and in 2018 it was €12 million. We can send this to the Deputy. I have the details all the way back to 2010 here. Would the Deputy like me to forward those details to her?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2010 it was at €10.9 million. It seems to fluctuate between €11 million and €12 million. In 2020 and 2021 it was between €9.8 million and €10 million. It depends on the licence fee sales.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The intellectual property is an issue of copyright which would not lie with my Department. It may be something to raise with the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas le baill an choiste as an gcuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. I thank committee members for the invitation to join them today. The purpose of the Bill is to put the necessary legal framework in place to complete the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall, NCH. It will cement the role of the NSO within the NCH, formalising and enhancing the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall in 1981. Although largely technical in nature, the Bill marks an important step in the journey the orchestra, the concert hall, RTÉ, my colleagues and I have been on for the past number of years. It is divided into four parts with Part 1 dealing with general provisions, such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the Bill. Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. These provisions date from the transfer day, 24 January 2022. It does so by amending the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015. Part 3 provides for the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the everyday operation of the NCH by adding a new function for the maintenance and operation of an orchestra and choir to the functions of the concert hall. It also provides for an increase in the membership of the board from eight to nine members. The legislation requires this additional board member to have experience of and expertise in the development of orchestras. The final Part replaces RTÉ’s previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only. I look forward to going through these in more detail. The legislation builds on the commitment of everyone involved to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music. Critically, the Bill provides a new function for the concert hall dedicated to the development and maintenance of the orchestra. It also places the orchestra at the centre of the concert hall’s corporate governance arrangements by providing for a new board member with orchestral expertise and experience. In some ways, the Bill represents the end of one journey – the transfer of the orchestra and choirs – but it is also the first step in a much more important journey as we now turn our minds to building and enhancing the symphony orchestra and concert hall to ensure they are fit for purpose in an evolving environment and are at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come. The challenge of the past few years has shown us the immeasurable value of music and live performance. It has certainly cemented my view of the value of the orchestra and concert hall both at the heart of classical music in Ireland and as a place for people to come together and enjoy a shared musical experience. Mar a dúirt an tUachtarán ag Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann i mí Iúil:Lig dúinn ceiliúradh a dhéanamh ar cheol ... na hÉireann i ngach cruth a thagann sé, agus lig dúinn athcheangail a dhéanamh leis an gceol, agus an tábhacht atá ag baint le taispeántas beo agus muid ag ceiliúradh … le chéile. Music is just one part of the wider cultural offering of our national cultural institutions. In that context, I have tabled three amendments, the purpose of which is to raise the limit of the State’s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State, which is required for visiting exhibitions. These amendments are critical to ensuring our pre-eminent cultural institutions, such as the National Gallery and Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, continue to be able to receive high-value, international loans and exhibitions. The success of the recent Freud exhibition at IMMA shows the value the public place on having works of such international importance shown here, as well as raising our profile internationally to stand with other national galleries and institutions. Under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity is limited to €190 million. This figure is no longer fit for purpose as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago. I, therefore, propose to increase this limit to €1.6 billion. With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors, thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions. This will increase the cultural offering available to the public. I thank members for their time, and I look forward to their consideration of the Bill and these three amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The administrative transfer took place in January 2022, and it will take effect once this Bill is enacted.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:“ “Act of 1997” means the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997;”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They are referred to in the 2015 Act, and this is just an additional definition for the purposes of the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is the names on the transfer day that are being referred to.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The advice from the Parliamentary Counsel is that it is provided for on transfer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is addressed by the new function and this changes that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is this concerning Part 4?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In section 2, amendment No. 2 is to insert:In page 9, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “PART 4AMENDMENT OF ACT OF 1997
Amendment of section 44 of Act of 1997
14. Section 44 of the Act of 1997 is amended in subsection (1) by the substitution of ‘€1,600,000,000’ for ‘£150,000,000’.”.The purpose of these amendments is to raise the limit of the State’s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State that is required for visiting exhibitions. As things currently stand, under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity shall not exceed €190 million or IR£150 million. This figure is no longer fit for purpose, as I said in my opening statement, as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor for the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland, since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago. The indemnity ceiling was previously temporarily amended by means of statutory instrument. SI 86/2016 raised the limit to €1.5 billion for five years, primarily to accommodate the five-year loan of the Freud collection to IMMA and the overlap of significant exhibitions at the National Gallery of Ireland. However, that temporary increase expired on 31 October 2021 and the limit has since reverted to the original limit of €190 million set out in 1997. This constrained the planning of international exhibitions as the total value of indemnities on works from outside the State on loan to our institutions cannot exceed €190 million. Currently, the alternative for our cultural institutions is to arrange for commercial insurance, a significant additional overhead. Such insurance can cost hundreds of thousands of euro per exhibition. The provision of a general permanent increase in the statutory indemnity limit under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 is not merely a technical amendment but in accord with policy on risk management relating to the public finances. The approval of the Government was required and was granted at its meeting on 28 June 2022. I am, therefore, seeking to revise the ceiling to a limit of €1.6 billion. The increased figure has been calculated based on the increased values of artworks and artefacts, and the anticipated number of incoming international high value loans planned in the State over the next five years. The increased limit would apply to works from outside the State on loan to the national cultural institutions, the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Hunt Museum and the Royal Irish Academy. With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors – thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions. This will increase the cultural offering available to the Irish public.  Finally, it should be noted that the proposal to increase the ceiling to €1.6 billion has been sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I hope the committee will agree that this is a necessary intervention, which will ensure the continued success of programming at our cultural institutions and provide an even greater variety of cultural experiences for the Irish people. Amendment No. 3 to the Title is to insert the following:In page 5, between lines 12 and 13, to delete all words from and including “2015;” in line 12 down to and including “matter.” in line 13 and substitute the following:“2015; to increase the aggregate amount of liability in respect of undertakings given for cultural objects on loan from a person resident outside the State and, for that purpose to amend the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997; to make certain changes to the objects of RTÉ and, for that purpose to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.”.This amendment contains the changes required to the Long Title so that this title also reflects the amendments proposed, namely, amendments Nos. 1 and 2, to raise the limit of the State’s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That administrative transfer was done under sections 7 and 9 of the 2015 Act so it was not ultra vires. That should ease Deputy Munster's concerns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This section puts in place the appropriate safeguards for the transfer of staff from RTÉ to the concert hall. The staff are to be transferred with the terms and conditions they enjoyed at RTÉ. Under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, or TUPE regulations, however, such terms and conditions do not include pensions. The Department engaged the services of a financial consultant in 2021 to advise on the implications of the transfer for transferring employees' pensions and remuneration. The consultant met with the transferring staff one to one. Consultation also took place through the oversight and working groups. Representatives from RTÉ, the concert hall, the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, choirs and the unions were in attendance at the meetings to advance this process. All practical issues relating to the transfer, including terms and conditions and pension entitlements, were resolved following an extensive process of engagement with staff and staff representatives. A similar provision to subsections (1) and (2) is included in section 32 of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015, which established the concert hall as a national venue for performance, appreciation and enjoyment of music. All this was done on the basis of advice from the Attorney General and is essentially an avoidance-of-doubt measure. There is no impact on pensions. Very detailed work went into ensuring that none of the individuals' pensions would be affected.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a drafting issue. This section provides a statutory basis for National Concert Hall management of the NSO and choirs, so that is addressed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 9, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:“PART 4AMENDMENT OF ACT OF 1997
Amendment of section 44 of Act of 1997
14. Section 44 of the Act of 1997 is amended in subsection (1) by the substitution of “€1,600,000,000” for “£150,000,000”.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think that is really just to give flexibility to choose the concert hall. That is why those groups are not named. It just states "other".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, lines 12 and 13, to delete all words from and including “2015;” in line 12 down to and including “matters.” in line 13 and substitute the following:“2015; to increase the aggregate amount of liability in respect of undertakings given for cultural objects on loan from a person resident outside the State and, for that purpose to amend the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997; to make certain changes to the objects of RTÉ and, for that purpose to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.”.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputies again for their engagement. My officials have taken note of the matters raised, which the Department will consider. As I have outlined, this is a technical Bill that provides for the transfer of functions from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall and provides that legislative underpinning for the transfer of the NSO and choirs from RTÉ to the concert hall. As I think I said earlier, the Bill presents a important step forward in the journey of both the orchestra and the concert hall and a critical part of the concert hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st-century concert hall. I look forward to seeing the Bill make steady progress through the next Stages.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá mé sásta a bheith ag labhairt leis na comhaltaí inniu. Go dtí seo, má bhí rialachán ar bith i gceist, bhí sé déanta ag na comhlachtaí nó na meáin shóisialta iad féin. Ar bhealach tá sé thar am go ndéanfaimid a leithéid. The members all know how important this Bill is in a range of ways. It is important to our economy in promising to deliver on a modern regulatory system for a crucial business sector. It is important for our society in providing safety and security for people as they seek to benefit from the considerable opportunities provided by the Internet. It is most important, however, for our children. We can all acknowledge how important it is to be able to protect our children from online harm and empower them to deal with the challenges of an online society. I propose a range of amendments in three categories. The first is on foot of issues raised in Seanad Éireann and on which I committed to act. The second is amendments to provide for the individual complaints mechanism and the third is amendments required for technical reasons. The Government approved the amendments on 18 October. The expert group report on the individual complaints mechanism was published on 20 September. The group ultimately concluded that the complaints mechanism was feasible and, on foot of that, the appropriate amendments have been drafted. The amendments ensure that coimisiún na meán has a legal basis to begin phasing in a robust individual complaints mechanism in the coming years which will initially focus on children and a number of non-offence-specific categories of harmful online content such as cyberbullying. Another amendment is designed to provide for the inclusion of further forms of offence-specific harmful online content under Schedule 3 of the Bill. This further content relates to the criminal offence of flashing under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. The amendments will allow the online safety commissioner to appropriately deal with online content related to the offence of flashing through systemic regulations. Other important changes are amendments to ensure the inclusion of local broadcasters in the scheme to support professional journalistic practices and to provide clarity on when coimisiún na meán may dismiss certain complaints. I know that members of the committee have proposed a range of amendments on a range of issues and I look forward to the debate. I intend to bring a number of amendments to the Bill on Report Stage. The first group of amendments will be to section 53, specifically those provisions that relate to the content production scheme. I am conscious that Deputies have proposed their own Committee Stage amendments to section 53, some of which relate to matters that I have been considering for some time. I look forward to discussing them in detail with Deputies and indicating how I will seek to address those issues on Report Stage. I intend to bring an amendment to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. I intend to bring a number of technical amendments to remove references to the obligation of RTÉ and TG4 to maintain the teletext service. There is a sense of urgency to this debate, not least in the form of infringement proceedings pending at EU level, because we are very motivated to formally establish coimisiún na meán and empower and resource it to start its important work. Our debates and discussions since the publication of the Bill in January are really only the beginning. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as a gcuid oibre agus an Bille ag déanamh a bhealaigh trí na Dála.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Ó Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe. As the Deputy said, amendment No. 1 seeks to change all references to the commission in the Bill to coimisiún and amendment No. 5 seeks to change all references in the Bill from commissioner to coimisinéir. As Deputies will be aware, section 9D(1) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, provides that the name of a statutory body established on and from the commencement of section 4 of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, shall be in the Irish language. I can come back to the Deputy regarding the commencement. He has raised some valid concerns. Ní mholaim glacadh leis na leasuithe inniu ach tuigim na pointí a rinneadh. Toisc gur ceist chasta í seo maidir le dréachtú reachtaíochta, lorgóidh mé tuilleadh comhairle dlí agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuig an ábhar seo ar Chéim na Tuarascála. An bhfuil sé sin ceart go leor?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 9, line 32, to delete “section 139ZZ(1)” and substitute “section 139ZZH(1)”.The purpose of this group of amendments is to make provision in the Bill for an individual complaints mechanism, as recommended by the online safety expert group in its comprehensive report. When I established the expert group earlier this year I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, I would provide for it in the Bill. That is what I am proposing to do with these amendments. The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism, including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian e-safety commissioner. The expert group’s report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism, focused on operationalising the mechanism on a phased basis and firstly for children. These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group’s report and they hew closely to the expert group’s recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. In this regard, amendment No. 118 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how an coimisiún can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content; the threshold that must be met before an coimisiún will handle a complaint; the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to an coimisiún; a requirement for an coimisiún to set out a plan for operationalising these provisions; and a requirement for an coimisiún to prioritise operationalising the individual complaints mechanism for children in the first instance. The remainder of the amendments in this grouping - amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 43, 82, 108, 118 to 120, inclusive, 124 to 128, inclusive, 130 to 136, inclusive, 146, 148 to 256, inclusive, 258 to 264, inclusive, 266 to 269, inclusive, 272 to 292, inclusive, 317 and 318 - are consequential to amendment No. 118 and relate to the necessary renumbering of sections throughout the Bill to account for the insertion of amendment No. 118.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 9, line 34, to delete “section 139ZZ(2)” and substitute “section 139ZZH(2)”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 9, line 36, to delete “section 139ZZ(3)” and substitute “section 139ZZH(3)”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 6: In page 10, line 30, to delete “definition” where it firstly occurs and substitute “definitions”.These are purely technical amendments inserting a definition of the e-commerce directive into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions. This is being proposed to avoid repeating the title of the directive where it is referenced in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 10, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:“ ‘E-Commerce Directive’ means Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market;”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Munster and Mythen for their amendment, which seeks to add the word “impacts” to the phrase “the nature and characteristics of published material” within the definition of media literacy in the Bill so that it reads as “the nature, characteristics and impacts of published material.” While I am sympathetic to the proposed amendment, I am confident that its intentions are covered by the definition of media literacy as a whole, which refers to the “public understanding of material published in print, broadcast, online or other media.” It is also in line with the meaning of media literacy used by the Media Literacy Ireland network in practice. The line the amendment seeks to change is contained within a non-exhaustive list of things which this public understanding may comprise.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 9:In page 16, line 19, to delete “meaning given by” and substitute “same meaning as in”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 10:In page 16, lines 19 to 22, to delete all words from and including “Directive” in line 19 down to and including “Market” in line 22 and substitute “the E-Commerce Directive”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 16, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:
“Meaning of “under the jurisdiction of the State”: providers of other services that may be relevant online services 
6. The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 2B:“2C. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the provider of an information society service, other than a provider to whom section 2A or 2B applies, is under the jurisdiction of the State if the provider of the service is established in the State within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the E-Commerce Directive.(2) In this section ‘information society service’ has the same meaning as in Article 1(1)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015.”.”.The amendments in this group seek to clarify that the jurisdictional test for when a relevant online service which is not a video sharing platform service is established in Ireland is set out in Article 3 of the e-commerce directive. Amendment No. 11 contains the substantive section, a new section 2C to be inserted into the 2009 Act, while amendments Nos. 12 and 13 involve consequential renumbering. These amendments are purely to give greater legal clarity as to how jurisdiction for such services is determined under the Bill and do not in substance alter the legal framework set out in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 12:In page 16, line 32, to delete “section 2B” and substitute “section 2C”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 16, line 33, to delete “2C.” and substitute “2D.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 14 seeks to provide an coimisiún with the power to compel online services to provide any data requested that pertains to public interest research or any data that the commissioner deems to be relevant in protection of the common good. I do not believe it is appropriate to give a regulatory body a general power to compel the disclosure of information based on what would be its own definition of the public good. My advice is that any such power must be explicitly linked to the functions envisaged for that body. An coimisiún already has the power to compel designated online services to provide it with information regarding their compliance with their obligations under online safety codes and the Bill sets out that it is an offence for them not to do so. Regarding access to data for the purposes of public interest research, the Digital Services Act sets out a detailed process by which this may be done. That Act is expected to enter into force by the end of November 2022, following which EU member states will have 15 months to implement its provisions in their national law. This process is being led in Ireland by my colleague the Tánaiste. Including this amendment would therefore pre-empt or duplicate those provisions which would, on both counts, be inappropriate. For these three reasons, I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas arís leis na Teachtaí as a gcuid leasuithe. In Uimh. 15 agus 16, iarrtar leasú a dhéanamh ar fhoráil sa Bhille go ndéanfaidh coimisiún na meán a dhícheall lena chinntiú go bhfreastalóidh a bheartais maidir le seirbhísí craolacháin agus físe ar éileamh ar an bhealach is fearr ar riachtanais mhuintir oileán na hÉireann, ag cur a dtraidisiúin agus a dteanga san áireamh trí thagairt shonrach a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge. Ceapadh an fhoráil seo den Bhille lena chinntiú go gcuirfidh coimisiún na meán le traidisiúin agus le teangacha éagsúla ar fad ar ár n-oileán san áireamh ina chuid oibre. Tá sé i gceist go gcuirfidh an tagairt do theanga, ní hamháin don Ghaeilge, don Bhéarla agus don Ultais ach don iliomad teangacha eile a labhraíonn daoine atá ina gcónaí ar ár n-oileán san áireamh. I understand that the intention of amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are to specify a particular role for coimisiún na meán in supporting and promoting the Irish language and Irish language programming. I consider that the intention of the amendments is already provided for in the specific references to the role of an coimisiún in paragraphs (c) and (e) of subsection (3) of section 7 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Bill. I, therefore, cannot accept the amendments. I leasú Uimh. 18 d’athrófaí an dualgas atá ar an choimisiún cláir Gaeilge agus cláir a bhaineanna le hathrú aeráide agus inbhuanaitheacht chomhshaoil a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh go dualgas chun forbairt agus soláthar na gclár sin a chinntiú agus a mhéadú. The committee will know that I am strongly in favour of increasing the availability of Irish language programming. I have secured increased allocations to TG4 over the past three budgets. When I took up the post as Minister, the Exchequer allocation for TG4 was €37.2 million. In 2023, that allocation will be €52.2 million, which is an increase of just over 40% over a three-year period. I also approved TG4's proposal to establish a new dedicated Irish language children's channel, Cúla4, and made a specific €3.3 million provision in budget 2023 to support the new channel. The language in the Bill is sufficient to ensure support by an coimisiún for the production of programming in the Irish language with regard to climate action. Replacing the term "promote and stimulate" with "ensure and increase" would imply that an coimisiún, as a media regulator, could direct the editorial content of a broadcaster or video-on-demand service towards a particular outcome. As an coimisiún will not have that power, I do not propose to accept the amendment. Aontaím le cuspóir leasú Uimh. 21. Mhol na Seanadóirí Warfield, Ó Donnghaile, Gavan agus Boylan leasú ar Chéim an Choiste sa Seanad. Ar Chéim na Tuarascála sa Seanad thug mé ar aghaidh leasú ar an Bhille ina bhforáiltear in alt 7(3)(c) den Acht Craolacháin 2009, a dtagann an Bille ina áit, go ndéanfaidh an coimisiún úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh sna meáin cumarsáide a fheidhmítear sa Stát. This is a broader duty than proposed by the Deputies given that it encompasses the print media in addition to broadcasters, video-on-demand services and online services. I, therefore, do not accept amendment No. 21.
I leasú Uimh. 20, d’fhorálfaí go bhféadfadh an coimisiún athbhreithnithe straitéiseacha a dhéanamh ar na hearnálacha a rialaíonn an coimisiún maidir le craolachán i nGaeilge. The committee will be aware that the Report of the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisiún na meán should conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system, with a focus on institutional structures and opportunities for innovation and collaboration as well as strategies for youth engagement and Irish language education. Amendment No. 20 would confine the strategic review to broadcasting in the Irish language whereas the comprehensive review to be undertaken by an coimisiún will be broader in scope and include digital media. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept it.
I leasú Uimh. 33 cheanglófaí go gcuirfí sonraí faoi leith maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha sna meáin san áireamh sa ráiteas straitéise a ullmhaíonn an coimisiún. Níl an fhoráil sa Bhille maidir le hábhar an ráitis straitéise saintreorach maidir leis na torthaí nó cuspóirí ar cheart a chur san áireamh in aon ráiteas. Tá sé sin toisc go leagtar amach dualgais agus feidhmeanna an choimisiúin go soiléir in alt 7 den Acht Craolacháin 2009, a dtagann an Bille ina áit. Bheadh aon ráiteas straitéise bunaithe ar na dualgais agus na feidhmeanna sin agus leagfaí amach ann na cuspóirí agus aschuir a bhaineann lena chomhlíonadh. Ní bheadh sé iomchuí díriú ar fheidhm ar leith de chuid an choimisiúin maidir leis an ráiteas straitéise ó tharla go bhféadfadh sé a thabhairt le tuiscint go bhfuil ordlathas cuspóirí ann don choimisiún. Tá sé i gceist go gcomhlíonfaidh an coimisiún a fheidhmeanna reachtúla go léir, ó shábháilteacht ar líne go cur chun cinn na gclár Gaeilge. Ní ghlacaim leis an leasú. I cannot accept amendment No. 66. The proposed amendment would infringe on the editorial freedom of both advertisers and media service providers. However, we are taking action to increase the quantity of Irish language advertising. As the committee will be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently brought the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 through the Oireachtas. As a consequence, section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media. Amendment No. 320 would amend the Long Title of the Bill to reference specifically the role of coimisiún na meán regarding the use and visibility of the Irish language. The Long Title of the Bill is not intended to capture or reference comprehensively every duty of coimisiún na meán nor to reference one in particular. Rather, it is intended to set out the broad contents of the Bill. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar a dúirt mé cheana, cuireadh leasú ar Cheim na Tuarascála sa Seanad go ndéanfadh an coimisiún úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh sna meáin chumarsáide a fheidhmíonn sa Stát. Rinneadh déileáil leis an leasú sin sa Seanad. On hearing and seeing more Irish language programming, I point to the media fund. As Deputies know, the sound and vision fund was restricted to radio but now we will have print and radio and there is €6 million of immediate funding there that will start with local democracy and court reporting. Irish language content was included in the most recent round of sound and vision funding, so I see much more scope with the media fund of €6 million that I have asked the BAI to start looking at already. As I said, that includes print as well as broadcasting on air and on TV.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill already addresses the issue, which is essentially about the co-operation between regulatory bodies on the issue of gambling, by setting out that coimisiún na meán must co-operate, in relation to the regulation of gambling, with any public body concerned with that matter. This means that on establishment, an coimisiún will co-operate with the existing public bodies responsible for gambling and will also co-operate with the gambling regulatory authority when it is established. At a technical level, I cannot accept the amendment because the Bill cannot require an coimisiún to meet a body that does not yet exist or produce a report on a sector for which it has no remit. However, I am satisfied the strategic issue the amendment seeks to address is already adequately dealt with in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 23:In page 22, line 1, to delete “section 48(3), (4) or (5)” and substitute “subsection (3), (4) or (5) of section 48”.This is a grouping of purely technical amendments. Amendment Nos. 23 and 24 clarify references in the Bill to the functions an coimisiún may delegate to an individual commissioner. These amendments do not change the legal position regarding what can be delegated but simply fix some technical discrepancies. Amendment No. 26 changes the phrase "a nominee of the person" to "a person acting on behalf of the person". The wording to be inserted is considered more suitable for this section, which relates to the disclosure of interests, as it is more encompassing than the word "nominee". The purpose of amendment No. 31 is to replace a reference to "monies" in the Bill with a reference to "moneys".I have been advised that "moneys" is the more constitutional spelling. The purpose of amendment No. 32 is to replace a reference to "Central Fund" in the Bill with a reference to "Exchequer". This reflects the general usage in legislation to provide that receipts are to be paid into the Exchequer and that payments are charged or paid out of the Central Fund. The purpose of amendment No. 49 is to fix the section title of section 46I. This is being done on the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The purpose of amendment No. 50 is to replace a comma with a dash at the beginning of section 46I. Again, this is being done on the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 60 is intended to clarify the meaning of a phrase on not giving unfair preference to any political party in terms of the allocation of broadcasting time or the positioning of content in a catalogue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment does not refer to a person. It simply substitutes "an unfair preference is not given" for "they do not give an unfair preference". Is the Deputy wondering whether this only applies to political parties?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill does read "political party", so perhaps that is something we need to examine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy’s point is well made. We will examine it and revert on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 22, line 4, to delete “section 139W(6) or (8)” and substitute “subsection (6) or (8) of section 139ZE”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Ó Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe. I leasuithe Uimh. 25, 27 agus 28, iarrtar inniúlacht sa Ghaeilge a bheith ag bunlíon de bhaill fhoirne nó coimisinéirí i gcoimisiún na meán. It is important to set out the overarching legislative background that has been in place since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 last December. Section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, now provides that the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee established under the 2021 Act shall have regard to the objective of increasing, by 31 December 2030 at the latest, the number of staff of public bodies who are competent in the Irish language such that at least 20% of staff recruited are competent. As I have previously indicated, the BAI is specified as a public body in the First Schedule of the Act and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions of the Bill, coimisiún na meán will be considered a public body under the Act. On that basis, I cannot accept amendment No. 28, which seeks to replicate the provisions of section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act within this Bill. Mar an gcéanna, ní ghlacaim le leasú Uimh. 27, a d’éileodh go mbeadh inniúlacht sa Ghaeilge ag 30% nó níos mó de na coimisinéirí agus 20% nó níos mó de bhaill fhoirne choimisiún na meán. Soláthraíonn Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla an bonn do chuspóir a bhaineann le comhlachtaí poiblí. Ní fheicim go bhfuil fiúntas i gceanglas sonrach a chur i bhfeidhm ar choimisiún na meán. I cannot accept amendment No. 25, which would require the executive chairperson and one other commissioner to be competent in the use of the Irish language. I am advised that this provision is unnecessarily restrictive. I would note that the recruitment booklet for the role of media development commissioner advertised in July identified competency in the Irish language as a desirable quality. As the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee continues its work over the coming years, consideration could be given to requiring competency in the Irish language for one of the commissioner posts. However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisiún na meán. Accordingly, the best way to provide for that recruitment is through the recruitment process for commissioners rather than in legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 26:In page 25, line 36, to delete “a nominee of the person” and substitute “a person acting on behalf of the person”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies who tabled the amendment and those who contributed on it. As they said, the Bill already provides that community broadcasters will not be liable for the industry levy, so this is focused on commercial radio broadcasters. I value the service being provided by local radio. I grew up not too far from Deputy Munster and I relied on LMFM and Northern Sound. I know the value of local radio in rural Ireland. The industry levy contained in section 21 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, is based on the principle that each category of service pays for the cost of activities related to that service so that there is no cross-subsidisation of one sector by another. This is an important general regulatory principle and one I do not think we should depart from. However, it is important to note that the Bill already provides that up to 50% of the cost of regulating broadcasting can be met through the TV licence. This was carried over from the Broadcasting Bill, which Deputy Naughten in particular progressed. However, the Deputies will also be aware that a technical working has been established to look at reforms to the TV licence and we must let that group complete its work. Members will also be aware of the additional funding I mentioned earlier that has been put in place for radio through the sound and vision fund. These supports will also be available at an increased level through the media fund. I am committed to radio and I believe these measures will help.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the Bill provides for up to 50%. I understand the Deputy's concerns about the word "can", but that technical group is looking at how that could be applied. Deputy Canney knows his target audience. He went for the soft spot when he mentioned music with me. He got there before Deputy Cannon. The Department has provided funding in the sound and vision fund for musicians. I appreciate that value. There is no disputing it. I am not sure if we can go further but I will commit to examining it and coming back on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 31: In page 32, line 33, to delete “monies” and substitute “moneys”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 32:In page 33, lines 12 and 13, to delete “Central Fund” and substitute “Exchequer”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his amendments. Before turning to matters of language, I must note that it is not usual practice to lay documents before specified Oireachtas committees which are already being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. On that basis, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 35 and 38. Amendments Nos. 34, 36 and 37 require the annual report and statement of strategy to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in both official languages. These amendments appear to replicate the requirements of section 10 of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended. Given that the BAI is listed as a public body under the Official Languages Act, coimisiún na meán will be covered by that Act by virtue of the transitional provisions set out in the Bill. Mar sin ní bheidh mé ag glacadh leis na leasuithe seo.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will come back to the Deputy on that. I understand the concern he as raised earlier as well. I can see the need for certainty.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment seeks to make statutory provision for consultation on the provision of a dedicated Irish-language youth radio service. I will not accept this amendment because the Future of Media Commission recommended that coimisiún na meán undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system and the results of that review will inform developing any actions necessary in this area. Tá sé tábhachtach a thabhairt faoi deara freisin go gcaithfí aon mholadh do sheirbhís raidió nua a chur ar aghaidh tríd an gcreat rialála atá ann cheana féin. D’ainneoin ár dtiomantas do thacaíocht leanúnach na Gaeilge agus d'fhorbairt na Gaeilge, ní hé foráil reachtúil a dhéanamh an bealach is oiriúnaí chun tuilleadh seirbhísí Gaeilge a bhaint amach.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Aithním an spéis ar leith atá ag an Teachta san ábhar seo. Tá an spéis chéanna agam ann. Aithním an frustrachas freisin. I will give some further information on this. The BAI, through its Irish language services advisory committee, which includes representatives from broadcasters and Irish language organisations, is carrying out a research project to ascertain the potential demand for such a service, the kind of content which such a service would provide, and the implications for the FM spectrum. I expect its report before the end of the year. If it can be done, I want it to be done. I hope the report will be helpful on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 42 would have the effect of preventing an coimisiún from co-operating with groups in the establishment of standards or self-regulatory systems as they relate to commercial communications. Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms. Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments that would appear to contradict the directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 43:In page 44, line 29, to delete “section 139ZK” and substitute “section 139ZS”
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the Deputy's first point, the online safety codes deal with the rules on complaints handling. If companies do not abide by the codes that they have signed up to, they will be fined or sanctioned as set out in the provisions. An coimisiún will also have the power to demand that platforms remove particular content. That is how that will be dealt with. In relation to the right to be forgotten, it is a data protection matter. It is not for coimisiún na meán to deal with; it is more for the Minister for Justice. It is a matter for the Data Protection Commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I noted when this issue was raised in the Seanad, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it is troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching the public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps. I just do not think we should prescribe in legislation what RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show. Under section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence as regards programming content.The purpose of that independence is to prevent political interference in the operation of RTÉ and TG4. Prescribing the format or content of programming in such a detailed manner, no matter how well-intentioned, would run contrary to the principle of editorial independence and, as legislators, I do not think we should make law regarding the types of content that may be shown on our public broadcasters to this degree of granularity. I acknowledge the amendment seeks to address a number of incidents that offended many people, but I cannot accept it because it would set a wider precedent for the regulation in primary legislation of specific types of content.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I again refer to section 29 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, whereby both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence, a concept I believe the Deputy accepts. Of course, as I said, I understand how it is upsetting for people living on the island of Ireland to see part of their island removed from maps depicted by a public service broadcaster, but I do not think we should prescribe in legislation what RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show. It would set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the points being made, as someone who grew up in a Border town, but my advice suggests primary legislation is not the place to address this. I think these concerns should perhaps be communicated to the national broadcasters and the committee might wish to communicate them as a follow-on to this discussion. I do not believe primary legislation is where it should be addressed because there is a concern as to the precedent that would set regarding content.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It goes back to the original point, regarding section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, at the heart of which is editorial independence-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----so it would be an instruction.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 48, 62, 64 and 84 would have the effect of setting quotas for the provision of broadcast content and the proportion of advertisements that must be in the Irish language. Deputies may be aware that a number of amendments were proposed on Seanad Committee and Report Stages regarding gender- and nationality-based quotas in respect of musical works on sound broadcasting services and a quota for participation on news and current affairs programmes. I indicated to Senators at the time that I would carefully consider those proposals. On foot of legal advice from the Attorney General on the proposed quotas considered on foot of the Seanad Stages of the Bill, I decided not to introduce any provision for them here on Committee Stage. Instead, the Government agreed that an amendment should be drafted to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. I intend to introduce these amendments on Report Stage. I raise this now in this context because the advice of the Attorney General has a bearing on my approach to the issue of placing binding quotas for certain types of content in primary legislation.
Amendment No. 48
seeks to impose a general duty on audiovisual media service providers and sound broadcasters in the State to promote the Irish language and requires coimisiún na meán to examine the feasibility and merit of setting out minimum requirements for the provision of content in the Irish language through television programme service and sound broadcasting contracts. As Deputies will be aware, the duties placed on broadcasters through Chapter 2 of Part 3B of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 9, are intended to protect the rights of audiences and individuals rather than to compel broadcasters to take a particular action. On quotas, as the advice received from the Attorney General in respect of gender-based quotas I referred to earlier indicates, there are a series of complex legal questions associated with quotas relating to competition law and freedom of expression. There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports. For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from €37.2 million in 2020 to €52.2 million in 2023. I agree that we should explore what further steps should be taken to promote the Irish language. These could include making express provision through media service codes, as I intend to do on Report Stage, regarding the promotion of gender balance and musical works composed by or performed by women. However, I do not agree that an amendment requiring a report to be prepared is appropriate, given that coimisiún na meán will be undertaking a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. I believe that we should await the results of the review and accordingly cannot accept the amendment.
Amendment No. 62 would set a quota on sound broadcasting services regarding time dedicated to music containing lyrics, mostly in the Irish language, from 5% from 2026 rising to 10% from 2031. The amendment would also provide that 40% of music broadcast in the English language should be reserved for musical works composed by at least one Irish or European Economic Area national. I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music and compositions performed in Irish on our broadcasting services. Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world. As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure appropriate supports are in place to nurture and protect this sector further. However, following the advice of the Attorney General received regarding gender-based quotas, I am acutely conscious of the legal and other factors that must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas. I understand the Deputies have drafted the amendment to seek to ensure compliance with EU law, as a language-based airplay quota has been successfully introduced by the French authorities, for example. From a policy perspective, the potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue, particularly in the context of the current media climate. I do not think the legal or policy complexities can be resolved in the timeframe of this Bill and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. However, this is a matter that can be considered in the context of the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.
Amendment No. 64
would require audiovisual media service providers, including broadcasters, to ensure that at least 20% of advertisements made available on the service would be in the Irish language from 2026. As I indicated earlier, we have already placed a duty on public bodies to ensure that at least 20% of advertising placed is in the Irish language. In addition to concerns regarding the legal complexities of any quotas, this amendment may have a number of unintended effects that would require careful consideration. First, the measure could reduce the revenues that broadcasters could earn if there is not a sufficient supply of Irish language advertising from advertisers to produce content in the Irish language. For example, if a broadcaster currently broadcasts 95% of advertisements in English, a 20% quota could lead to a significant drop in advertising revenue, if advertisers do not first correspondingly increase their production of Irish language advertising and price it accordingly. There is also a risk that there comes to be, in effect, two advertising pricing structures, one for English language advertising and one for Irish language advertising. Second, given the country-of-origin principle that underpins the audiovisual media services directive, this requirement could only apply to audiovisual media service providers registered or licensed here in Ireland. Accordingly, services regulated in other member states that target Irish audiences would not be bound by the quota, potentially increasing their share of revenue earned from advertising vis-à-vis Irish services. As the broadcasting sector in particular already faces significant challenges to advertising revenues due to the change in ways that content is consumed, I am of the view significant analysis and consultation with stakeholders would be required before considering such a change. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
Amendment No. 84
would require that sound broadcasting service contracts and television programme service contracts include a provision requiring broadcasters to provide at least 30 minutes of programming in Irish between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. I will not accept this amendment today. As with the Deputies' other proposed amendments, this is a matter that could be considered by the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system that will be undertaken by coimisiún na meán.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 49:In page 49, line 33, to delete “: ‘relevant media service provider’ ”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 50:In page 49, line 34, to delete “Part,” and substitute “Part—”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 51:In page 49, line 34, after “Part,” to insert the following:“ ‘party political programme’ means a programme broadcast, or made available in a catalogue of an audiovisual on-demand media service, by or on behalf of a political party for the purpose of promoting the political party;‘political party’ means a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties;”. Section 46M(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill as passed by the Seanad, retains the prohibition on advertisements of a political nature and the derogation from that prohibition in the case of "party political programmes", previously known as "party political broadcasts". In that, the Bill is intended to reflect long-standing policy.  During the debate in the Seanad, I signalled that "party political programme" was intended to have the same meaning as "party political broadcast", namely, the short programmes carried on our public service broadcaster during electoral periods for the purpose of promoting a registered political party. The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure that it encompassed both broadcasts by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider, in other words, to ensure that it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player. Senators and a number of stakeholders, including RTÉ and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, sought clarity in the Bill that "party political programme" had essentially the same meaning as "party political broadcast". Given the importance of providing clarity in this matter I am introducing amendments Nos. 51 to 58, inclusive, to provide for a definition of "party political programme" in the Bill.  Amendment No. 67, when read with consequential amendments Nos. 68 to 76, inclusive, provides that media service codes, which will apply to broadcasting and video-on-demand services, may provide that party political programmes may only be made available at specified times. Currently, party political broadcasts are only made available during electoral periods. This provision is intended to make coimisiún na meán's authority to specify the timing of party political programmes explicit. The intention is that these times shall continue to be during electoral periods. However, to provide flexibility, the provision refers to specified times rather than electoral periods to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure that it encompassed both broadcasts by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider, in other words, to ensure that it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 52:In page 50, line 5, to delete “million.” and substitute “million;”.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 58:In page 50, to delete lines 23 to 25.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 59:In page 50, line 32, after “or” to insert “undue”. During the Seanad debates on Committee and Report Stages on the Bill, a number of Senators indicated that they considered the provision that prohibits broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services making available programmes which may reasonably be considered to cause “harm or offence” as being potentially contrary to the principles of freedom of expression. I committed to examining the matter. Having examined and considered the matter, I am proposing amendment No. 59 to qualify the standard applied to broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services from “offence” to one of “undue offence”. This will align the language in the Bill with the standard of “harm or undue offence” to material applied by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland through its code of programme standards, ensuring that the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition. In qualifying the term "offence" the amendment recognises what the BAI recognises in practice, which is that there is no guarantee that programme material will be free from offence, given that the definition of "offence" varies from person to person. However, the amendment will still guard audiences against undue offence which shall continue to be enforced by coimisiún na meán through media service codes. In this context I also note that the Bill contains numerous safeguards in respect of fundamental rights, not least that one of the primary functions of coimisiún na meán is to uphold the democratic values in the Constitution, including freedom of expression. However, it must be stated that the right to freedom of expression is not absolute and, like all other rights, is subject to balancing the law to ensure that the rights of others, for example the right to safety and security, are not unduly infringed. This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. I am confident that this Bill sits comfortably within those traditions. Amendment No. 65 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 59.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The codes will set out that detail. This is what the BAI currently uses in broadcasting codes already. What we are trying to do here is align that language with what is there and applied by the BAI through its code of programming standards. It is what is used by the BAI currently in its broadcasting codes, so we are just ensuring the statutory provision is in line with the practical implementations of the prohibition.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The codes will set out in practice what it should mean. This arose during the Seanad debate. In qualifying the term "offence", the amendment recognises what the BAI recognises in practice and currently uses, which is that there is no guarantee that programme material will be free from offence, given the definition of "offence" varies from person to person. However, this amendment will still guard audiences against undue offence, which will continue to be enforced by coimisiún na meán through media service codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not something we can define in legislation. As I said, it is something-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----that will vary from person to person. The media service codes are to be abided by, by whosoever has signed up to them and if there is a complaint made, it is for the commissioner to decide.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That will be for the commissioner to decide. I am saying there are some there that are currently used by the BAI. It will be for the commissioner to decide.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 60:In page 52, lines 3 and 4, to delete “they do not give an unfair preference” and substitute “an unfair preference is not given”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his amendment. Section 46L(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, seeks to reflect the current policy regarding the requirement for sound broadcasting services to devote a set amount of broadcast time to news and current affairs programmes. This is subject to a derogation that may be issued by coimisiún na meán to a licensed radio service. This derogation is currently exercised by the BAI with radio stations such as Christmas FM. The amendment brought by Deputies Naughten and Canney would remove section 46L(7), which provides that the various radio services provided by RTÉ are covered as one radio service for the purposes of the news and current affairs requirement. As Deputies are aware, RTÉ radio services are not licensed by the BAI, nor will they be licensed by coimisiún na meán. Instead, RTÉ services are subject to extensive statutory duties set out in Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. Accordingly, it is not possible for the BAI, and will not be possible for coimisiún na meán, to offer a derogation to RTÉ from the requirement to set aside a minimum amount of time to news and current affairs programming. For that reason, the Bill provides that RTÉ services may be considered as one service for the purposes of the minimum requirements. If the Bill did not have this provision, Lyric FM would be subject to the minimum requirement as much as Radio 1, with no recourse for a derogation, unlike all other radio services. This would have negative implications for both RTÉ and audiences, who currently have considerable choice across RTÉ services, while being well served by news and current affairs programming. That is why I cannot accept this amendment. The practical effect of the amendment would be to require more news bulletins on, for example, Lyric FM. In the longer term that would create a disproportionate requirement on RTÉ which, unlike licensed broadcasters, would be unable to avail of this derogation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is recognising that different stations have different target audiences.It would unduly restrictive to require RTÉ to have a particular percentage of news content on all its stations. We are not changing anything here. This subsection reflects the current Broadcasting Act. We are not changing anything but rather carrying it over to the commission. RTÉ is obliged to provide news and current affairs extensively on a nationwide basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are not changing anything. The Deputy seems to think we are changing something. We are not changing anything. We are replicating what is in the Broadcast Act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We can engage on this with officials after this. This was brought in in 2009. It is hard to access it now to show it to the Deputy but we can engage with him. The intention is not to change anything. I will ask my officials to engage with the Deputy after this meeting, if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendments. As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to allow coimisiún na meán to identify and designate providers of what are referred to as sound streaming media and music sharing platform services; second, to provide for coimisiún na meán to impose a levy of 20% on the revenues of those providers earned in the State; and third, for the proceeds of the levy to be granted to the Arts Council for the purposes of making schemes to support the production of Irish music. As the committee knows, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting Irish art and artists, including musicians, across all practices. That is why I brought forward the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will provide €325 per week to support 2,000 artists, including 584 musicians over three years, and allocated an additional €2 million to the sound and vision scheme to support the live music-related programming this year. I understand the intention of the amendment is to raise further funds to support the Irish artists. I also understand the concerns that have been raised by musicians and artists regarding their remuneration for content consumed through music streaming services. This is a complex area and, in the first instance, I would emphasise that copyright law is a matter for Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The committee will understand why I cannot accept this amendment. It represents a major policy departure requiring extensive analysis and consideration, with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed. I would have a number of specific concerns regarding the amendment being proposed here. First, I note there is no explicit legal basis in EU law for such as levy. As Deputies are aware, the revised audiovisual media services directive applies to audiovisual broadcasters, video on demand services and video sharing platform services. The provisions in Article 13(2) of the directive, which provide the legal basis for the content production levy contained in this Bill, are directed at audiovisual broadcasters and video on demand services. In particular, the innovation of Article 13(2) of the directive is explicitly to permit the levying of video on demand services targeting audiences in the State. Second, it is unclear whether net revenue is intended to be analogous to taxable profit under the tax code or refers to post-tax revenue. In either case, what is being proposed appears to be similar to the current corporation tax, albeit that it seeks to tax revenue that is earned by a service. I would note, in that context, that the rate proposed is considerably higher than the current rate of corporation tax. It would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a levy on net revenue in the first instance. Finally, the proposal would appear to target only those sound streaming services that are under the jurisdiction of the State, which I take to mean are established here. Accordingly, the levy would not appear to apply to the major services located outside the State. There is a risk then that those services currently established here would simply seek to relocate to another member state to avoid the levy.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 76:In page 55, line 21, to delete “subsection (9)” and substitute “subsection (10)”.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 79:In page 59, line 34, to delete “Complaints”.Section 11 provides for amendments to sections 47 and 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, the purpose of which is to extend the complaint-handling provisions which currently apply to broadcasters to cover video on-demand services and to provide for circumstances in which coimisiún na meán may handle complaints made to broadcasters and video on-demand services. Section 47 of the Broadcasting Act, in particular, provides for the preparation and implementation of codes of practice for complaints handling by broadcasters and video on-demand services. Section 48(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, provides for the circumstances in which an coimisiún may dismiss a complaint, while section 48(9) provides that a complaint that is being resolved under a code of practice prepared by a broadcaster or video on-demand service may still be treated by an coimisiún as a complaint made to it. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has noted that section 48(9) could be interpreted as allowing for a complaint to be submitted to an coimisiún which has already been effectively resolved under a code of practice prepared by a provider and that it is unclear whether an coimisiún would have the authority to dismiss such a complaint. The purpose of amendments Nos. 80 and 81 is to provide absolute clarity that coimisiún na meán can dismiss a complaint in those circumstances. Amendment No. 79 is a technical amendment to delete the section titled "Complaints" before section 48 of the 2009 Act to be inserted by the Bill, which deals with complaints handling with regard to media service providers, in light of the fact that a number of other sections with regard to the individual complaints mechanism for harmful online content will be inserted later in the Bill. This will avoid a single section being entitled, "complaints", where there are no multiple sections dealing with complaints in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 80:In page 60, line 23, to delete “or” and substitute the following:"(c) the complaint has been resolved effectively under a code of practice prepared under section 47(3), or”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 81:In page 60, line 24, to delete “(c) the complaint” and substitute “(d) the complaint”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 82:In page 60, line 27, to delete “section 139ZA(2)” and substitute “section 139ZI(2)”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 83:In page 61, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “(e) in subsection (21), in paragraph (q), by the substitution of “section 31 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022” for “section 3 of the Act of 1998”,”. The purpose of these consequential amendments is to take account of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022. Amendments Nos. 83 and 316 update references to sections of the Referendum Act 1998 and to the referendum commissions in order that they now refer to the Electoral Reform Act and, an coimisiún toghcháin, the new electoral commission. Amendment No. 319 amends a reference in the Electoral Reform Act to the Broadcasting Act 2009 in order that it now refers to the relevant section in this Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. As she said, it would require that no fewer than 50% of the board members of RTÉ be proficient in the Irish language. A provision of this kind would be at odds with provisions for membership of State boards more generally. With regard to the criteria necessary for consideration as a member of the board of RTÉ, section 82 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 already provides that candidates must have "experience of or shown capacity in", among others, "matters pertaining to the development of the Irish language". The specific provision contemplated by the amendment, over and above that already provided for or in addition to the provisions for membership of State boards more generally, is not necessary. Accordingly, I will not be accepting this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I again thank the Deputies for the amendment but I cannot accept it for a number of reasons. The amendment seeks to change the position in the 2009 Act where video on-demand services are titled "non-broadcast non-linear audio-visual media services" to "audiovisual on-demand media services" in line with the language in EU law.However, this is already provided for in sections 33 and 34. On the other elements of the amendment, which proposes to replace a reference to "the Irish language" with a reference to "the national aim of restoring the Irish language to use as a spoken language nationwide", I am advised that the current reference to the Irish language is sufficient and appropriate in the context of this section of the 2009 Act, which states that, in pursuit of its public service objects, RTÉ shall "be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. As with amendment No. 86, I cannot accept amendment No. 87 as it simply repeats a change to the 2009 Act made by the Bill, in this case in section 33. The other element of this amendment seeks to change the requirement on RTÉ to make available a national television and sound broadcasting service to the whole community on the island of Ireland “as far as is reasonably practicable” to a requirement to make it available “in full”. This would not be appropriate as it would legally oblige RTÉ to obtain a set of circumstances where it does not reasonably have the means to ensure those circumstances would always be in place, particularly as RTÉ is not a State body in both jurisdictions on this island. As with amendment No. 86, this amendment would have the effect, for instance, of obliging broadcasts to make available sports events both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State. Acquisition of rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between a rights-holder or sports body and broadcasters. These are very often allocated on an exclusive territorial basis and, as such, it is not possible to legislate for and compel RTÉ to make such events available. Examples of such events might include the World Cup or the Olympics. I understand the frustration of viewers in Northern Ireland when certain events may not be shown on RTÉ in Northern Ireland given the distribution of rights to those events. However, I am advised this amendment would not make a difference to the current position. Were this amendment to be interpreted as compelling RTÉ to acquire rights to sporting events, such as the Olympics, on an all-island basis, there could be significant unintended consequences in terms of the amount of additional expenditure that would need to be incurred by RTÉ. For example, were a rights-holder aware that RTÉ is compelled by legislation to make events available on an all-island basis, it may seek to charge a premium, given it would know that RTÉ would have to acquire the rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The difference here is it would be known by people that RTÉ is compelled by legislation to make events available, so therefore it would be unfair because it would be charged premium rights if it is compelled in legislation. Regarding the GAA, RTÉ made that decision itself. This would be forcing it in legislation and therefore would lead to that unfairness when it comes to looking to acquire rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Not within the context of legislation; perhaps in the broader outlook. This is not for legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I said in my contribution that I understand the frustration of viewers when certain events may not be shown. The people who cannot travel down and want to watch it in Tyrone and support their team cannot do that. However, if it were to be interpreted as compelling RTÉ to acquire the rights to such sporting events, it leads, as I said to Deputy Munster, to that unfairness. Premium rates would be charged if it is absolutely compelled. Sporting organisations – not RTÉ – are the ones allocating the rights on a territorial basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Deputy addressing amendment No. 88?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, in the case the Deputy is referencing, it is the sporting organisation, not RTÉ, that is the one allocating the rights on a territorial basis. It is not RTÉ, it is the actual sporting organisation, which in this case was the GAA. It is not RTÉ. Amendment No. 88 seeks to change the requirement on RTÉ to make available a national television and sound broadcasting service to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland “in so far as RTÉ considers reasonably practicable” to a requirement to make it available “in full, unless limited by factors beyond the control of RTÉ”. I do not see this amendment as materially changing the obligation already on RTÉ, as any limitation on RTÉ’s provision of services to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland arise almost exclusively from factors beyond the control of RTÉ. The purpose of the present provision is so that RTÉ can ascertain those limits and work within them to provide its services on the widest possible basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay for RTÉ employees. The independence of RTÉ in operational matters is provided for in legislation and I do not believe it is appropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard. RTÉ is currently undertaking a review of the staff grading structures across the organisation and services. If there are any discrepancies with regard to equal pay for equal work, I expect them to be identified and rectified through this process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I hear the Deputies' concerns and frustration about this. I am not sure if the place for this provision is within this legislation but I will ask my officials to follow up with RTÉ on this. I would be of the opinion, as I said earlier, that any discrepancies around equal pay for equal work should be addressed in that review. They should be identified and rectified. I will give a commitment that my officials will follow up with RTÉ on this. I just do not think this specific legislation is the place to put this but I will get my officials to follow up, if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We will come back to the Deputies before Report Stage. I am committing that my officials will follow up and look for clarity on that issue. We will have that information and the response before Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would introduce a new baseline for investment by RTÉ in Irish language content of 25% of the investment it makes in independent productions annually. As I outlined yesterday, the Future of Media Commission has recommended a comprehensive review of all Irish language services. I do not believe that making a statutory provision, as envisaged by the amendment, is the most appropriate way to achieve any further Irish language services. For this reason, I cannot accept the recommendation. We are going to have a comprehensive review of all Irish language services.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 94:In page 71, line 21, to delete “(1)”.Section 128C of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, provides that coimisiún na meán may make rules to ensure the prominence of public service programmes and media services on "interactive guides". In practice, public service programmes and services refer to RTÉ and TG4 as public service broadcasters and Virgin Media as a holder of a television programme service contract. Section 128C is intended to exercise an option available to member states under Article 7b of the audiovisual media services directive to take measures to ensure the appropriate prominence of audiovisual media services of general interest. In subsection (1) of section 128A the definition of "interactive guide" refers to an interface accessed by a "terminal", which itself is defined to refer to equipment with interactive computing capability other than a computer, tablet device or smartphone. In practice, the reference to "terminal" used in the Bill may have the effect of confining the application of any rules on prominence made by coimisiún na meán to platforms accessed through set-top boxes. That has the anomalous effect of applying the prominence rules to an interactive guide offered by a platform provider, such as Sky or Vodafone, through a terminal but not to the very same interactive guide offered by the same platform provider through a smartphone. Amendments Nos. 94 to 97, inclusive, are intended to address this anomaly by removing the reference to a terminal. This change, though largely technical in nature, will future-proof the prominence rules to allow them to reflect continuing changes in the ways audiovisual content is accessed and viewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 95:In page 71, lines 24 and 25, to delete “and accessed by the use of a terminal”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 96:In page 72, to delete line 18 and substitute “77.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 97:In page 72, to delete lines 19 to 27.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 are intended to ensure that coimisiún na meán provide for the prominence of Irish-language programming and services in any rules made by coimisiún na meán under section 128C of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill. As I indicated earlier, public service programmes and public service media services include, by virtue of the definitions set out in section 128A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, RTÉ and TG4. Both of our public service broadcasters are required by their statutory objectives, set out in sections 114 and 118 of the extant Broadcasting Act, to provide programmes in the Irish language. TG4 is, of course, required to provide programmes primarily in the Irish language. For that reason, in providing for the prominence of our public service broadcasters, in particular TG4, section 128C adequately provides for the prominence of programming and services in the Irish language. Given the Bill already addresses the intention of amendments Nos. 98 and 99, I will not accept them. Amendment No. 100 seeks to insert a reference to the rights of Irish-speaking users to engage with interactive guides in the Irish language in section 128C(2)(b). I believe the intention underlying this amendment is addressed by subsection (2)(e), which provides that in preparing rules on prominence an coimisiún shall have regard to the rights of users of prominence guides, with particular regard to their rights and likely expectations regarding Irish-language programmes and services. Accordingly, I do not accept amendment No. 100.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not propose to accept the amendment. I note the intent of the amendment but this matter will primarily be addressed by my colleague, the Tánaiste, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the DSA in Ireland. It would not be useful to cut across that work at this stage. Members will be aware that in March the Government decided that coimisiún na meán, when established by this Bill, will act as the primary regulator, termed the digital services co-ordinator, DSC, under the DSA. Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the DSC, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. Disinformation and false information are being tackled on an EU-wide basis, not just through the DSA but also through the European Commission’s code of practice on disinformation. This is a Commission initiative, which has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. The Commission intends that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. Clearly, an coimisiún, as the DSC, would have an important role to play in that context. In addition, the Commission has established the European Digital Media Observatory, including a hub in Dublin City University, DCU, which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. At national level, as the Deputy referenced, the Future of Media Commission recommended the creation of a national counter disinformation strategy. A working group is being set up in my Department to start work on this and to give effect to that recommendation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When the DSA comes into effect-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It will be the DSC. The Government agreed that. There is crossover there but we are working closely with our colleagues in the other Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Coimisiún na meán will be the regulator of it. The Deputy asked about the strategy as well, which is being led by my Department but it involves a working group of the relevant Departments, civil society organisations and industry stakeholders. I propose that there would be a public consultation on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	From the beginning I have always said that the Bill cannot address every issue at once. There is that connection with what has been done with the DSA in the Tánaiste's Department so it is not that it is being left to one side; we are getting this up and running. It cannot address every issue at once and because the coimisiún will be the DSC you will see that being worked together and whatever crosses over will be addressed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not propose to accept this amendment but I accept that there is an issue with young children accessing online services that were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue that I am aware of, both as a parent of and as the chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety. It is a complex issue that it is being worked on at EU level. Finding workable solutions in this area will raise a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters, that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. However, I will ask an coimisiún to examine this issue as a priority, in conjunction with the Data Protection Commission and through engaging on the Better Internet for Kids strategy, to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. As I said, not everything can be dealt with in a single Bill but what matters is that we put the framework in place. I will tell the commission to deal with this as a matter of priority but it is also about dealing with it on an EU-wide basis. In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids. The strategy is built on three pillars - child protection in the online environment; digital empowerment; and active participation. Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, which the amendment is trying to address, including through age verification and age-appropriate design. In this regard, the Commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the DSA, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments. The Commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content. To facilitate age verification, the Commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age verification methods. This would be most effective if it was done on a Europe-wide basis and that is why we need to wait. There is a pilot as well called euCONSENT.I think I have mentioned the pilot to the Deputy previously during Question Time or at the committee. It is an ongoing pilot looking to deliver that online age verification and parental consent which balances the rights I mentioned earlier, the rights of the children and the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content. The result of that pilot will inform us on an EU-wide basis. It would be more effective to do it on an EU-wide basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is no intention to do that in this Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Deputy that it is an important issue, but it is highly complex. The important thing is to get this framework in place and getting the commission set up. I will be asking it to look at priorities in conjunction with the cross-cutting of the Data Protection Commission. Getting the framework in place is the important bit. I agree with the Deputy that it is a very important issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 103:In page 81, line 28, after "services" to insert "the provider of which is". These are technical amendments to refer to the provider of video-sharing platform services in section 139G, as inserted by the Bill, rather than simply the service itself. It is being done on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 104:In page 81, line 32, after "service" to insert "the provider of which is".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 105:In page 81, line 34, after "service" where it secondly occurs to insert "the provider of which is".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. Policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation. The amendment is also straying into matters which may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission. In particular, section 11(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides that the WRC shall "conduct reviews of, and monitor developments as respects, workplace relations". I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the WRC. I understand the intention of the amendment. The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors which are regulated by the Bill. I also acknowledge the concerns raised by Deputies regarding working conditions in the technology sector. Last year, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade unions, experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions. The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms. One of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved, as Deputy Mythen noted, and in particular the kinds of distressing content that she was required to view as part of the role.  The Tánaiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment. He also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated that it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again.  It is important to stress that the protection of workers’ rights is not a core function of my Department or its agencies. It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy. Moving responsibility for workers’ rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors. In that regard, the role of an coimisiún, as an independent regulatory body, is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video-on-demand and designated online services. It is not intended to regulate employment relations or assess working conditions.  As a general principle, in considering any amendments to expand the functions of an coimisiún I am very conscious of not unduly expanding the scope of an coimisiún into other areas of policy, with the effect that its core functions, which I have just outlined, might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I go back to the role of an coimisiún. It is an independent regulatory body to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation. There would not be a role there to put in a code on workers' rights. We are tackling it through the codes that will be there relating to prohibiting damaging content being available. That is what this is about. Moving responsibility for workers' rights into this is not what this commission is set up to do. It is there to end the era of self-regulation. We are tackling online harmful content through this. I could not envisage a code there on workers' rights. That is for a different Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The protection of workers is still an employment issue and it is not the core function of coimisiún na meán.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment has two purposes. First, it seeks to ensure the measures taken under online safety codes create equal level protections for users of Irish and English language user-generated content available on designated online subject to online safety codes. Second, it seeks to ensure that Irish language content cannot be removed or prevented from appearing on a designated online service if similar English language content was not removed or prevented from appearing from the service. I cannot accept these amendments for a number of reasons. The first of these is that the online safety codes will give effect to provisions of EU law in many case, particularly in the implementation of the EU's audiovisual media services directive. In that regard, it would be inappropriate to single out only two of the official languages of the EU. The second reason is that the proposed requirement for designated online services to not remove Irish language content would not reflect the fact that Irish and English are separate languages and a word or phrase that may be functionally equivalent in each may carry entirely different implicit meanings or connotations that may cause either or both to fall within a particular category of harmful online content. This is the case not only with English and Irish, but with all languages. In fact, it is a particular problem space in online safety and something that coimisiún na meán will need to be alive to in operating the regulatory framework for online safety.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did not say that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What I said was that the online safety codes will give effect to provisions of EU law in many cases, particularly in the implementation of the EU's audiovisual media services directive. In that case, it would be inappropriate to single out only two of the official languages of the EU when there are many languages in the Union.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 108:In page 86, line 34, to delete “section 139X” and substitute “section 139ZF”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment seeks to prevent current and former political officeholders from being appointed as auditors regarding a designated online platform's compliance with online safety codes or their complaints handling systems. I am not accepting the amendment as, in particular, I am not sure what is the value in preventing a former political officeholder, especially a member of a local authority, from being appointed as an auditor. Realistically, appointed auditors are likely to be firms providing professional services rather than individuals and it would be strange to prevent the appointment of a firm as an auditor on the basis that a member of its staff used to be a councillor. If the Deputies’ concerns relate to cooling-off periods more generally for persons holding public office, then that would be a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 111:In page 88, line 36, to delete “and”.These amendments insert into the Bill provisions requiring that coimisiún na meán must give reasonable notice of an audit to a provider of a designated online service.The purpose of these amendments is to ensure legal clarity around the operation of these provisions and to ensure audits are not delayed or challenged on the basis of a lack of notice being given.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is just saying that reasonable notice of an audit must be given. It is up to the commission and it depends on how complex the audit will be and how much preparation is needed. It will differ. It is making sure reasonable notice is given to ensure these audits are not delayed or challenged.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 112:In page 88, to delete line 37 and substitute the following:“(d) specify the co-operation that may be requested by the person appointed, and”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 113:In page 88, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:“(e) require the provider to provide that co-operation, subject to reasonable notice being given by the person appointed.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 114:In page 89, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following: “and shall give the provider an opportunity to make representations in writing to the Commission on the report within such period as the Commission specifies.”This amendment would require an coimisiún to provide an opportunity for designated online platforms to make submissions in respect of an audit report prior to its publication. To clarify, it would not change the outcome of an audit report and the comments made by the designated online platform in question may also be published alongside the audit report. These provisions mirror similar requirements under the provisions for reports by authorised officers and are a key due process requirement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 115:In page 89, line 10, to delete “and” and substitute the following:“(9) After considering any representations made under subsection (8), the Commission”.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 118:In page 89, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:“CHAPTER 4

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I discussed this last night.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This concerns bringing the complaint to the attention of another body where the commission considers the complaint relates to activities of the body. That could be, for example, the Garda. Is that what the Deputy is referring to?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That could be the Garda or the Data Protection Commissioner. It will be brought to those sorts of bodies.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The sanctions are those outlined in the Bill. In regard to the handling of complaints, there are sanctions up to and including fines.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It could be the Data Protection Commissioner and it could be the Garda. I can forward the Deputy a more detailed list, if that is helpful.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not this committee; it is the advisory committees to the commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They will be laid by the commission before each House of the Oireachtas, so the committee will have access in that way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am not sure what the Deputy is referring to but I understand that will be published on the website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It could also be the EU for video-sharing platforms.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am happy to come back to the Deputy if she wants to communicate with me afterwards.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 119:In page 89, line 25, to delete “4” and substitute “5”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 120:In page 89, line 28, to delete “139R.” and substitute “139Z.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 121:In page 89, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:“(a) on identifying harmful online content, and in particular on the application of subsection (4) of section 139A,”.These amendments insert into the Bill provisions that clarify matters relating to the making of online safety guidance materials. Amendment No. 121 clarifies that coimisiún na meán can make online safety guidance materials relating to the risk test for non offence-specific harmful online content. Amendment No. 122 clarifies that coimisiún na meán can make online safety guidance materials on matters relating to the online safety aspects of the Bill rather than simply in general. Amendment No. 123 is a consequential renumbering.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 122:In page 89, line 30, to delete “(a) on any matter” and substitute “(b) on any other matter relating to the operation of this Part or”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 123:In page 89, line 32, to delete “(b) otherwise” and substitute “(c) otherwise”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 124:In page 90, line 12, to delete “139S.” and substitute “139ZA.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 125:In page 90, line 12, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 126:In page 90, line 29, to delete “section 139X” and substitute “section 139ZF”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 127:In page 90, line 31, to delete “139T.” and substitute “139ZB.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 128:In page 90, line 32, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment seeks to require an coimisiún to provide an explanation to the Minister and to the Houses of the Oireachtas whenever it withdraws any online safety guidance materials or advisory notices. I am not proposing to accept this amendment. There are already a range of Oireachtas oversight mechanisms built into the Bill and, in that context, I am advised it is not appropriate to require it to account in this way for this specific type of decision. For example, it would appear it could apply in a situation where an coimisiún was withdrawing some guidance because it was updated with new guidance, which would seem to be overly burdensome.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 130:In page 91, line 7, to delete “5” and substitute “6”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 131:In page 91, line 10, to delete “139U.” and substitute “139ZC.” 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 132:In page 92, line 21, to delete “139V.” and substitute “139ZD.”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 133:In page 92, line 27, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 136:In page 93, line 30, to delete “139X.” and substitute “139ZF.”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 137:In page 93, line 40, to delete “Directive 2000/31/EC” and substitute “the E-Commerce Directive”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. It seeks to introduce rules for businesses offering subscription services, including in relation to renewals, cancellations, recurring charges and information provision. I cannot accept the amendment because it is outside the scope of the Bill and it is more appropriate to consumer protection legislation. As well as this, the amendment does not appear to provide for any enforcement mechanism and would also appear to apply to any business, whether it operates online or offline.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No 139:In page 98, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following: “35. Online content by which a person exposes his or her genitals intending to cause fear, distress or alarm to another person contrary to section 45(1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.36. Online content by which a person intentionally engages in offensive conduct of a sexual nature contrary to section 45(3) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.”.There are two kinds of categories of harmful online content contained in the Bill at present, those related to existing criminal offences, such as harassment under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, or Coco's Law, and those that are not linked to criminal offences, such as cyberbullying and the promotion of eating disorders, suicide and self-harm. This amendment will add existing offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 relating to online flashing to the schedule of offence-specific harmful online content in the Bill. This amendment will enable the online safety commissioner to make binding online safety codes that will apply to designated online service providers that will require those providers to take measures to tackle online flashing. Without this amendment, online safety codes could not specifically refer to this type of harmful content online and an coimisiún would not be able to require online service providers to tackle it in terms of how they deal with complaints, how they deliver content and in terms of risk and impact assessments. These codes will apply to online services designated by an coimisiún on the basis of risk assessments and may include social media services, messaging services and videoconferencing services. It will remain the role of An Garda Síochána to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour. An coimisiún's role will be to be oversee the regulatory framework for online safety and hold designated online services accountable for their compliance with online safety codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe we are replicating the wording of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 in the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are not creating a new criminal offence. We are replicating the language that is used in the 2017 Act. The determination of whether an offence has been committed is made on the balance of probabilities. We are not creating a new offence.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That would be a matter for the Department of Justice to consider, not my Department. We are just providing for this to be harmful online content on the basis of what is set out in the 2017 Act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am not sure intention works the same way in legal terms as we might understand it in everyday terms. The amendment is replicating the language used in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. We are not creating a new criminal offence. We are ensuring the issue can be tackled in the online world.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have to remember what I said at the very beginning. It will remain the role of An Garda Síochána to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour by an individual. The role of the coimisiún will be to oversee the regulatory framework. In the context of criminal proceedings, it would be a matter of being beyond reasonable doubt. Taking online content down will be ascertained on the balance of probability. There are two different things. It will remain the role of the Garda to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour. This is about the online content.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, this amendment seeks to replace the words “any neglect” in the phrase “the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to any neglect” in the provisions for senior management liability, where a provider of a designated online service commits an offence for failing to comply with a notice to end a contravention. I understand that some industry stakeholders have raised concerns that the liability standard of “any neglect” is too low and have sought to replace it with “wilful neglect”. I cannot accept this amendment for a number of reasons. It is important to note that the senior management liability provisions in the Bill can only be triggered as part of the following series of steps: an authorised officer investigation has been carried out; coimisiún na meán has determined that a contravention is occurring; the findings of an coimisiún have been confirmed by a court; an coimisiún has determined that a contravention is still occurring and has issued a notice to the provider of the designated online service to end the contravention; the provider of the designated online service has failed to comply with the notice and is being prosecuted for the offence by the Director of Public Prosecutions; and the Director of Public Prosecutions, independently to an coimisiún, seeks to prosecute a director or senior manager under the secondary liability provision. In this context, I think “any neglect” is appropriate. It was provided for in this way in light of, on the one hand, the extensive financial sanctioning powers in the Bill and, on the other, the need to provide a particular balance in a Bill that deals with media, user-generated content and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. For context, I understand, and the Deputy raised this matter in his contribution, there are almost 1,500 references to the same liability standard in Irish law so this is not unique. In this Bill, in fact, the circumstances provided for wherein senior management liability may be triggered are quite narrow. Recent examples of its usage include the sanctions on Russia in light of its illegal invasion of Ukraine, building regulations, protected disclosure legislation, food safety regulations, domestic violence law and childcare laws. The Deputy referenced the UK's Law Commission report, but Ireland's Law Reform Commission report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences, stated that this specific form of secondary liability "does not necessarily result in undue harshness to a defendant, particularly where in a corporate setting the processes and procedures required to meet the standard of negligence are within the peculiar knowledge of the senior managers and comparable agents".

This amendment will simply provide legal clarity in that regard. The geographical limits of any particular content limitation notice will depend on the kind of harmful online content being addressed and any associated national, EU or international law. For example, a content limitation notice ordering the removal of an item of content on the grounds that it constitutes a public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, which is an EU law, would have an EU-wide geographical reach. Under EU and international law and jurisprudence, this would already be required of coimisiún na meán when issuing a content limitation notice requiring, for example, an online service to remove or disable access to a particular item of harmful online content. Amendment No. 271 is a consequential renumbering.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 293:In page 126, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:“(b) by the insertion of the following definition after the definition of “free television service”;“ 'local sound broadcaster' means a person holding a sound broadcasting contract under section 63—(a) which is a contract for the provision of a sound broadcasting service in an area consisting of a part, but not the whole, of the State, and(b) which is not a contract under section 64 or 68(1)(b);”,”.The objective of the Government amendments in this grouping, namely, amendments Nos. 293, 295, 296, 298, 302, 303, 305 and 321, is to ensure that local sound broadcasters can avail of the scheme for professional journalistic practices that is being provided for in the Bill. The Bill as published would have restricted the scheme to community sound broadcasters. This scheme has been under consideration for some time, and I understand may have originated when Deputy Naughten was Minister, a fact I want to acknowledge today. The scheme formed part of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 introduced in the Oireachtas by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, and was subsequently incorporated into this Bill. Amendment No. 293 inserts a definition of “local sound broadcaster” in order to give effect to the intention to extend the scheme to local broadcasters. In practice, the definition of "local" includes any contract for a sound broadcasting service in an area consisting of a part of the State. Accordingly, I emphasise that the use of term local includes holders of multi-county and regional sound broadcasting licences. These amendments will ensure that local broadcasters can avail of grant funding to provide training or professional development for persons employed by, or providing services to, the broadcaster in relation to promoting good professional journalistic practices.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I address all the amendments to which the Deputy has spoken? She mentioned amendment No. 300, which seeks to achieve the same objective as a Government amendment. Accordingly, I will not be accepting amendment No. 300. I have introduced that measure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the rationale underpinning amendments Nos. 294, 299 and 301, which seek to make this scheme accessible to community television broadcasters. I agree with the Deputy that it is important to recognise the important role played by community television in this country. I will not accept those amendments today but I will consider them on Report Stage. I believe the objectives of amendment No. 297 are already addressed in the Bill. Amendment No. 304 seeks to require that the commission, in developing a scheme, should have regard to developing impartial journalism through the medium of Irish. In the context of this particular scheme, which is directed towards training in respect of good journalistic practice, I do not think it is necessary to make reference to the language medium in which journalism is provided to the public. However, while I do not accept the amendment, I agree with the objective of developing journalism through the medium of Irish. As the committee is aware, the report of the Future of Media Commission recommended the establishment of a platform-neutral media fund to support six new schemes. I secured €6 million in budget 2023 to set up two of those schemes for local democracy reporting and a court reporting scheme. My officials have commenced work on developing the broad parameters of the schemes and I have directed them to ensure that part of the funding is directed towards journalism in the Irish language.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I reply?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, as part the new schemes we are developing, I have directed my officials to ensure that part of the funding is ring-fenced for journalism in the Irish language.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We all strongly support measures to support the works of Irish artists and the creation of Irish art. Since I became Minister, annual funding for the Arts Council has risen from €100 million in 2020 to a record €130 million. This year, I launched the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will support 2,000 artists over three years. However, the proposed amendment appears to be contrary to European Union law. The proposed criteria for Irish cultural works offered in the amendment includes residence on the island of Ireland and supervision or control by producers on the island of Ireland. Those criteria would appear to be incompatible with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services and prohibit discrimination based on nationality. Notwithstanding the legal complexities I also have concerns regarding the practical implementation of the amendment. There is a potentially large outstanding catalogue of musical and audiovisual works that would be considered as Irish cultural works under the proposed amendment. The Arts Council would be required to devote considerable resources to assessing those works against the criteria suggested by the Deputy and providing certification. In the event of a rejection of a work for authentication by the council, there would also be a need for an appeals process. I fear that an attempt to implement this in practice would prove both highly contentious and time consuming with little benefit for Irish artists or art. For reasons of both legality and practicality, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 307 seeks to amend the requirement for a video-on-demand service to have a share of European works in its catalogue of not less than 30% to further require a minimum percentage of works in the Irish language, being 5% from 2031 and 10% from 2036. The requirement for a minimum share of 30% of European works is set out in Article 13(1) of the revised audiovisual media services directive, which is binding on all member states. The European Commission has published guidelines for member states regarding the method of calculating the share of European works in the catalogue of a video-on-demand service. Under section 159B(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, it will be for an coimisiún to make rules to determine whether video-on-demand services meet the European works quota. I expect it will be heavily informed by the guidance of the European Commission in that regard. I am aware that some member states have provided for a minimum quota for native language works in catalogues of video-on-demand services. For example, I understand that the legal instrument providing for the European works requirement in France, published last summer, included a requirement that 40% of works should be in the French language, subject to agreement between individual services and the French audiovisual regulator. In the Irish context such a requirement is complicated by two factors. First, there is a relatively small catalogue of audiovisual works in the Irish language as a percentage of all audiovisual works in other languages. We are attempting to address this through increased funding for TG4 and initiatives such as Cine4, which, of course, funded the beautiful "An Cailín Ciúin", but there is still much work to be done. I understand that the amendment sets out to partially address this by pushing out the imposition of a quota to 2031 and 2036, respectively. However, there remains the risk that a perverse effect of the amendment would be to force video-on-demand services to provide a relatively smaller catalogue to meet the 5% and 10% quotas. This would not be to the benefit of audiences. The second factor is the number of video-on-demand services that will be regulated in Ireland. Under the country-of-origin principle, those services established in Ireland would be regulated in Ireland for the entire EU. As drafted, the amendment would require those services to adopt the Irish language requirements for their catalogues. While this may have the potential, in the longer run, to be of the benefit to Irish audiences, it would not necessarily be in the interest of audiences in other member states. I cannot accept the amendment for that reason. Amendment No. 308 seeks to require an coimisiún, in making rules for the promotion of European works, to have regard to "the prominence of Irish language works in view of the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language and language of media nationwide". Given that I cannot accept amendment No. 307, I also cannot accept this amendment, which is consequential to amendment No. 307.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for their amendments, which seek to amend the provisions of the Bill relating to the content production levy and schemes. As the committee will be aware, Article 13.2 of the AVMSD provides an explicit legal basis for member states to levy media service providers that are under their jurisdiction or that are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories for the purpose of funding European works. I have opted to take the opportunity offered by Article 13.2 of the directive to provide for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund content production schemes to support the production of European works. There was a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad on both the content production levy and the scheme provisions of the Bill. I committed then to return to consider a number of matters on the Dáil debate on the Bill. In particular, I committed to examine whether express provision could be made to ensure that development activities could be funded through a scheme; to examine whether a certain minimum proportion of funds paid out under a scheme could be ring-fenced for "independent production companies"; and to examine whether provision could be made in respect of the allocation of rights ownership between independent production companies and media service providers. The Deputies have raised those three issues in their amendments and I intend to address them on Report Stage. In addition, as I indicated during the debate in the Seanad, I expect that coimisiún na meán and Screen Ireland will work closely together with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes. Turning to the detail of the Deputies' amendments, amendment No. 309 seeks to require coimisiún na meán to impose a content production levy as soon as is practicable after establishment day. As I have said previously, it would not be prudent or advisable to impose a levy until a comprehensive study has been undertaken into the incidence, design and prospective revenue of any content production levy. That will allow coimisiún na mean to identify any unintended consequences that may arise from the levy and to outline clearly whether and how the incidence of the levy will ultimately fall on audiences and consumers of audiovisual media services. Given the many additional questions about the content production levy that coimisiún na meán will need to answer, I cannot accept the amendment. I understand that amendment No. 310 seeks to address a drafting error in the Bill, as published. It is an intention of the Bill that a content production scheme should be open to all prospective producers of European works. This error came to the attention of my officials shortly after the Bill was published and it was intended to address the issue when other Government amendments to the content production scheme were brought forward. Accordingly, while I do not intend to accept the Deputies' amendment today, I will table a Report Stage amendment to correct the error. I understand that the intention of amendment No. 311 is to ensure that funds provided under a content production scheme may be used to support "development" activities relating to a production. At present, section 159F(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies a number of development activities that can be supported under a scheme. My preferred approach would be to amend that paragraph to provide absolute clarity that all stages of the development of an audiovisual programme may be funded under a scheme. I cannot, then, accept this amendment but will seek to clarify further on Report Stage that a content production scheme may include funding for development activities. Amendment No. 312 sets out additional detail in respect of the nature of programmes that could be funded under a scheme. It is unnecessary to specify that a content production scheme may fund feature films, animation, drama and documentaries. Section 159F(2) provides that a scheme may fund the production of audiovisual programmes, which captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes. Amendment No. 312 also provides that a content production scheme would specifically support works that relate to the works of Irish creative talent. As I noted during Report Stage in the Seanad, the outstanding and defining quality of such works would appear to be that they are produced by, or involve the work of, Irish citizens. This carries the implication that those of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme. This would appear to be contrary to EU law as it would, on the face of it, place Irish citizens at an advantage over citizens or residents of other member states as regards a content production scheme and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. Amendment No. 313 seeks to amend a description of the kinds of audiovisual programmes that may be funded under a scheme by qualifying a reference to the experiences of the people of the island of Ireland such that it refers to "storytelling" experiences. The relevant paragraph of the Bill is intended to encompass experiences in the most expansive sense to facilitate the funding of the widest array of content. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to restrict the types of content that could be funded and, therefore, I do not intend to accept it. Amendment No. 314 seeks to require that 80% of the funding under a content production scheme would be ring-fenced for "independent production companies" and to provide for the prescription of a fair and equitable balance in rights ownership. Although I do not intend to accept the amendment, I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the ring-fencing of a certain proportion of funding for independent production companies. I am also examining the question of providing that coimisiún na meán could make a certain allocation of rights ownership a requirement for receipt of funding under the scheme. I thank the Deputies for their engagement and their amendments. Our positions on a number of the matters discussed are quite close. I look forward to tabling amendments to address those issues on Report Stage and to the debate that will ensue then.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to carry out research on the introduction of investment obligations on media service providers operating in the State. The amendment also provides that the Minister shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers not later than six months following publication of the report. Before addressing the substance of the proposed amendment, I wish to note that it was determined that a content production levy was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context. As with the existing sound and vision scheme administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the model envisaged in the Bill would allow producers to compete for funding on a transparent and competitive basis in line with objective criteria. This would not be the case with investment obligations, where decisions on the nature of content to be funded would sit with the company subject to the investment obligation. Furthermore, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe. Our approach in respect of the content production levy already ensures a minimum of 25% of funds raised must be allocated to the production of Irish language content. It is also worth noting that any investment obligation would have to be for the production of European works and not necessarily Irish content. Many major EU-based providers targeting Ireland would likely already fulfil that requirement through their existing investments, so there may not be a substantial net benefit to Ireland from such a measure. I do not propose to accept this amendment as I am of the view that section 7 of the Broadcasting Act as inserted by section 7 of this Bill will contain appropriate provisions to enable an coimisiún to carry out research in relation to this matter. I draw the Deputy’s attention to section 7(5)(d), which enables the commission to conduct strategic reviews on a number of matters including the funding of sector. I also note that the Minister will have the power under this provision to direct an coimisiún to carry out research on any matter connected to its functions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No. We decided to go with the content production levy. We thought that was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The difference as well is what has been done in France is with individual providers whereas what we are doing here is with the sector as a whole.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, it was determined that the content production levy was the appropriate approach in the Irish context. As I said earlier, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, that is to do with individual, whereas we are dealing with the sector as a whole.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 316:In page 140, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:

CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá áthas orm a bheith anseo inniu chun moladh maidir le meastachán forlíontach do mo Roinnse a chur i láthair. D’úsáidfí an maoiniú seo go príomha chun fóirdheontas a thabhairt do chostais mhéadaithe fóntais agus mhaireachtála d’eagraíochtaí nach féidir leo leas a bhaint as tacaíochtaí cothrománacha eile atá á dtairiscint ag an Rialtas faoi láthair. Luaigh an tAire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe, An Teachta Michael McGrath, na hábhair bhreise seo agus é ag labhairt ar Lá an Bhuiséid. Ó shin i leith, tá m’oifigigh agus mé féin ag obair leis an Roinn sin chun bailchríoch a chur ar ghnéithe teicniúla na tacaíochta breise. The proposed 2022 Supplementary Estimate totals €53.61 million, resulting in a 2022 Revised Estimate total for my Department of €1.27603 billion. This comprises €35 million for the sports programme area, about which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will address the committee in detail. It also provides €15 million for RTÉ in line with the recommendations of the Future of Media Commission report. The proposed additional allocation of €15 million to RTÉ is to give effect to the Commission's recommendation, which was informed by the Commission's detailed examination of RTÉ’s financial situation and interim funding requirements. In terms of the culture and arts area, it is a well-established principle of public finance that, where possible, the requirement for additional support be first met within a Department's existing allocation, before seeking further funding to the Vote. Accordingly, I have reallocated savings within the Culture and Arts programme area to address the current operational pressures for the national cultural institutions, Screen Ireland, other cultural bodies supported by the Department and bodies supported through the Arts Council. This will be achieved by technical supplementary, details of which are contained in the committee's brief today. In summary, €15.54 million will be reallocated from savings in the basic income for the arts and live entertainment support areas. These savings arise in the basic income for the arts as it was rolled out later than anticipated due to the high volume of applications, with over 9,000 applications requiring review and assessment.I am happy to report that payments began in October and it is expected that up to €12 million will be paid to artists under this scheme by year-end. In the live entertainment area, savings arise due to the full reopening of the live entertainment sector on 22 January, sooner than anticipated, which allowed for 100% capacity for live events, with a removal of the requirement for vaccination or recovery certificates for access to venues and the reopening of nightclubs. This significantly changed context and provided the sector with an opportunity to generate box-office income. Accordingly, many grantees submitted revised and adjusted drawdown requests yielding savings under certain schemes. It should be noted that the measures put in place to support stakeholders in the live entertainment sector this year followed extensive consultation on the supports required and all eligible demands under those schemes was met in 2022. Additional funding will be provided to address increased utility costs in the cultural area as follows: €8.76 million in respect of cultural bodies under the aegis of the Department, spread across the various relevant subheads; €5 million in respect of arts and culture organisations to be administered by the Arts Council; and €1.78 million in respect of cultural organisations, including a number of regional museums, which are supported directly by the Department such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, the National Print Museum, the Cork Butter Museum, and the Hunt Museum. This additional funding will be provided from savings within the culture and arts programme in 2022 from subheads B16, €12 million, and B17, €3.54 million. As I mentioned earlier, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will address the committee on the additional allocation for sport. The remaining €3.61 million is accounted for in the context of increased pay across my Department and agencies arising from the Building Momentum public sector pay agreement. There is no direct request for additional funding in this Supplementary Estimate request in respect of the tourism programme in my Vote as it is anticipated that the universal supports to be provided under the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, will address the needs of this sector. The world has been impacted by global challenges, including the invasion of Ukraine, global inflation, and climate change. The Government has recognised the impact of the current situation through a number of horizontal measures designed specifically to protect the most vulnerable in our society as we face into the winter. There are also increased measures to support business and industry. Bodies supported under the cultural and sporting programme areas of my Department cannot avail of most of these supports, but given their direct and ancillary benefits to employment and the economy, physical and mental health and well-being, societal development and cohesion, it is appropriate for Government to support organisations in these areas. Let us not forget that during the worst of the pandemic, culture, sport, and media played a particular vital role in helping us find joy in the darker times. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as éisteacht linn agus labhróidh mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, anois maidir leis an maoiniú breise don spórt.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I outlined earlier, the repurposing of those savings of €12 million is a result of enormous demand and our determination to ensure the scheme will work and will be accepted by the sector. The savings from the scheme will benefit artists. Among the purposes for which the savings are being applied is the payment of €5 million to the Arts Council, which will offer supports to organisations that received support under strategic funding, arts grant funding or arts centre funding in 2022. The operation of these organisations is a critical support for artists and this funding will mean that resources which would otherwise have been diverted into meeting increased energy costs will now be available to support artists to make work and to present that work to audiences. Further savings will be applied to meet the needs of national cultural institutions to support regional museums and organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann which play such an important role in nurturing and promoting our traditional arts. Subhead B17 refers to live entertainment supports. In 2021, almost €54 million was awarded in grants to support the live entertainment sector as a targeted response to the Covid-19 restrictions which had obvious impact of stopping performers from performing. A further €50 million was provided for the live performance sector in 2022. That funding, along with a suite of measures, was designed to support the recovery of the sector as it fully reopened for live performance. These supports benefit from a specific state aid derogation for measures to deal with the pandemic which ended earlier this year. As with the other pandemic-related supports, these schemes will conclude this year as the crisis period has passed. Support for the arts and culture sector will continue to be provided by the Arts Council, the statutory body responsible for supporting the arts. That funding remains at a record level of €130 million for 2023. We will continue to engage, as we have done, with a broad range of stakeholders across the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors, including those represented on the live entertainment stakeholder forum, to understand the issues facing the industry. We are committed to continuing engagement with artists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I may have said this to the Deputy before on the basic income, but although the full €25 million for it was not spent this year, it is absolutely guaranteed that it is a €105 million programme over three years. It is therefore absolutely ring-fenced. To reassure the Deputy and members, the savings in relation to live entertainment were as a result of the recovery and did not arise as part of an attempt to reduce funding for the sector under any circumstances whatsoever. All applicants eligible under the requirements of each scheme were offered grants in 2022. The return to normal operating conditions allowed the sector an opportunity to generate box office income that in turn reduced the need for State supports. The State aid exemption due to Covid ended in June of this year and I referred to that earlier. I reassure the Deputy the savings were a result of recovery and not an attempt to reduce the funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify in case there is confusion, there is €3.61 million for Building Momentum and that is completely separate from the €15 million for RTÉ.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The €15 million figure arises from a direct recommendation for interim funding from the report of the Future of Media Commission. It is completely separate from Building Momentum. On the Deputy's other query, we spoke on this in the Dáil last week and, as the Deputy knows, I have followed up with another letter because I share his concerns about the pay disparity. I am awaiting a reply on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is €325.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his kind words on the basic income. This was about changing how we value the arts and I hope it is a game-changer in that. Deputy Mythen has been very supportive of it, as have Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Munster and Senator Warfield, and I thank them for that. It is €325 per week and the figure came from artists and their engagement with it. It was the number one recommendation of the report of the arts and culture recovery task force. It suggested the figure of €325 per week and so I held firm to that to deliver what was sought. That came from the engagement with the group. I share the Deputy's hopes. I hope this is a three-year research project as well as the money aspect of it. I am hoping the research will really prove it should be rolled out to all artists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the research element is the key part of this. Maybe the issues the Deputy raises is something that will come out of the research, but I wanted to adhere to the direct, number one recommendation from the artists themselves because they spent a lot of time putting that report together. Let us see what comes out of the research. We will have annual reports on this. There are journals being kept. We already have baseline survey done and we also have the control group of 1,000 too.Let us see what the research demonstrates at the end of the three years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are 500 musicians in the scheme. It is right across the board across the arts sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Two thousand artists are in receipt of the basic income, and 1,000 artists are in the control group. For each year the control group receives two weeks of basic income for participation in the research part of the scheme, and it is important to have that group as well.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas le baill an choiste as an gcuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. I thank the committee members for the invitation to join them. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the statutory basis to allow the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to increase the aggregate level of funding that may be allocated to Fáilte Ireland out of capital moneys provided by the Oireachtas for tourism product development. The limit on capital funding will shortly be reached and legislation is required to increase that limit. This Bill amends section 24(2) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, to increase the limit on capital funding from €300 million to €500 million, and sanction has been granted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This limit was increased on two previous occasions, 2011 and 2016, in similar Acts. Tourism is Ireland's most important indigenous and labour-intensive sector, generating substantial export earnings and tax revenues. It is woven into the fabric of Irish cultural and social life and is of critical importance to regional economies in particular. As potential visitors start to think about their next holiday, international destinations are vying for attention in an ultra-competitive market. It is vitally important therefore, that we keep Ireland top of mind for potential visitors and that they know that brilliant visitor experiences, attractions and activities are available to them. That is as important for domestic visitors. Ireland's tourism sector provides a wealth of opportunities for great tourism offerings, and Fáilte Ireland uses this capital funding to support the development and cultivation of those visitor experiences. This year alone, projects in the Céide Fields in Mayo, the Blasket Islands in Kerry, Knowth in Meath, Beyond the Trees in Avondale, and the National Famine Museum in Strokestown have opened. From a strategic perspective, Fáilte Ireland has four main funding channels for its capital investment in tourism product development to support the development and enhancement of tourism attractions and experiences. These include large grant schemes provided under the Platforms for Growth approach; small grant schemes, which are targeted and usually aligned with tourism experience brands; strategic partnerships and other collaborations; and direct investment in experience brand infrastructure. Fáilte Ireland has used Platforms for Growth to drive development in specific areas. For example, using funding provided by Government, Fáilte Ireland has provided €19 million to 20 locations throughout the country for water-based activities, which are a key visitor attraction. Is ceannscríbe é turasóireachta d'ardchaighdeán a chur ar fáil in Éirinn ó cheann ceann na bliana mar gheall air seo go léir. Gabhaim buíochas leis na baill as a gcuid ama agus as an mBille a bhreithniú, rud a bhfuil mé ag súil go mór leis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is something we should look at. The increase to €500 million will satisfy demand for the next few years. Perhaps we should be looking at a different way of doing this. It is something we will examine.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Fáiltím roimh an deis labhairt leis an Roghchoiste um Thurasóireacht, Cultúr, Ealaíona, Spórt agus Meáin agus Meastacháin Athbhreithnithe 2023 dar luach €1.066 billiún san iomlán do Vóta 33 do Réimsí Clár A, B, D agus E á mbreithniú. Tá áthas orm sonraí a sholáthar maidir leis na bearta suntasacha chun tacú leis na hearnálacha a bhfuil mé freagrach astu agus chun iad a neartú, agus iad éascaithe ag an maoiniú seo. Táim an-sásta deis a fháil labhairt leis an gcoiste maidir le príomhthosaíochtaí mo Roinne agus an fhís a leagan amach do na hearnálacha luachmhara fairsinge seo. Cuireann na hearnálacha seo go mór le geilleagar na tíre, agus tacaíonn siad le folláine an duine aonair agus an phobail ar fud na hÉireann chomh maith. Almost one year after pandemic restrictions ended, these sectors now face challenging economic conditions with high inflation and energy costs putting pressure on businesses. They must tackle the urgency of climate action so we can safeguard our planet for future generations. And of course they must play our part in Ireland’s response to the war in the Ukraine. As we have so often done in hard times, these sectors continue to reinforce our resilience, solidarity, and understanding; and support society’s cohesion and well-being. Total funding for 2023 for the sectors supported by my Department is as follows. In relation to tourism: Funding for Fáilte Ireland for 2023 amounts to €94.7, this is to help drive the sustainability of our tourism sector, boost industry recruitment and retention and facilitate the establishment of a register of short-term letting properties; continued additional funding of €15 million for the tourism marketing fund, giving a total allocation of €63.2 million for overseas marketing of Ireland and the development of The Invitation project; Tourism Ireland funding of €20.8 million; €36.5 million for tourism product development; €4.5 million for Ireland-EU just transition tourism funding to support ambitious climate action through the promotion of sustainable tourism; and €7.75 million for the Brexit adjustment reserve fund to grow tourist numbers and associated revenues from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Minister of State will brief the committee in more detail on the position in respect of sport. Prior to the onset of Covid-19, the tourism industry generated revenue of almost €6 billion supporting over 260,000 livelihoods equating to one in ten of all Irish jobs. Post pandemic, Irish tourism had a strong year in 2022,. Continued rebuilding lies ahead, however. Our primary focus now is on the sustainable development of this important economic and social sector, and marketing the island of Ireland as a desirable and competitive destination for both overseas visitors and domestic tourists. We must remind ourselves that 2021 was an unprecedented year for arts and culture against the backdrop of the pandemic and the extensive restrictions that were still in place.Venues were closed or restricted to very limited audiences. Survival was the primary focus. Thankfully, this has all changed since early 2022. Against this backdrop significant levels of funding have been maintained with total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2023 amounting to €356.982 million. The budget provides for: retention of the record €130 million funding for the Arts Council in recognition of the transformational impact of this funding and to support the sector; €35 million for the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, supporting 2,000 artists and creative arts workers; funding of €30.2 million for cultural infrastructure and development including €7 million for artists’ spaces and climate adaptation measures, which will allow for progress in the ongoing programme of investment in our capital institutions including at the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and the Crawford Art Gallery; €11.5 million for the newly extended Creative Ireland programme, including a new shared island dimension; €6.6 million in funding for Culture Ireland for the promotion of Irish arts worldwide, an increase of €2 million on the 2022 allocation; €72.1 million for the national cultural institutions to ensure the continuation of their high-quality services to the public; additional funding of €1 million for Screen Ireland giving a total record allocation of €37.9 million for the continued implementation of the Government’s ten-year audiovisual action plan. I should mention the wonderful success of Irish film at the Oscars this year, with a record number of nominations for "The Banshees of Inisherin" and with "An Cailín Ciúin" making history for the Irish language on screen. This is a testament to the levels of investment, support and continued development of the screen industry in Ireland. The budget also provides: a €3 million allocation towards the cost of developing a new archive and exhibition space as part of the overall national centre for research and remembrance; and €500,000 for supports for artists and arts workers as part of the Safe to Create programme, co-ordinated by Irish Theatre Institute, in collaboration with Minding Creative Minds. Funding for the media and broadcasting sector in 2023 will total €306.64 million and represents an innovative package which supports the sector from grassroots community radio and local newspapers to audiovisual media services and online regulation. The budget provides in particular for €7.8 million for the establishment of coimisiún na meán, the media commission, which will oversee effective regulation of online safety, support the provision of high-quality public service broadcasting, and put in place an expanded development and support framework for the wider media sector. I recently announced the appointment of new commissioners, including the Online Safety Commissioner, and they will take up their positions on an administrative basis next week. I intend to commence key provisions of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act and formally establish an coimisiún next month. An increased allocation of €7.3 million to TG4, will enable the launch of a new dedicated children’s channel, Cúla4, in September. This will be a totally new channel, operating from morning until the evening. It will include a children’s news service, entertainment and education content, drama and Irish animation. It will reflect the diverse backgrounds of children living in all parts of Ireland, but particularly in Gaeltacht and Irish-speaking communities. Its development will also support new jobs through the commissioning of additional content. A total of €6 million has been allocated to establish a local democracy reporting scheme and a courts reporting scheme which will support local, regional and national media on a platform-neutral basis. These schemes will be the first of six new schemes recommended by the Future of Media Commission. Separately the technical group examining television licence reform will deliver its recommendations to me next month. That report will be brought to Government in due course. Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe Rialtais as a dtiomantas leanúnach do na hearnálacha a ndéanann mo Roinn ionadaíocht orthu, ar chodanna ríthábhachtacha dár ngeilleagar iad. Go deimhin, tá ár bhféiniúlacht, comhtháthú sóisialta, agus folláine fhisiciúil agus mheabhrach bunaithe ar na hearnálacha seo. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address measures in the area for sport for 2023. I officially congratulate him on his appointment and I am looking forward to working with him.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It should be noted that budget 2022 was cast in a time when the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the sectors my Department supports was still all-encompassing. The 2022 budget contained funding aimed at supporting those sectors through the worst of the pandemic when many of them were in complete shutdown. The total allocation for 2022 was €1.276 billion, with €1.074 billion in current expenditure and €202 million in capital expenditure. Of the €1.074 billion in current funding, €290 million was provided on a once-off basis for Covid-support measures for initiatives including supports for live entertainment, sport and business-continuity funding in the tourism sector.This was all aimed at ensuring these sectors were sustained through the pandemic and would then emerge in a healthy position. The scale of that intervention in 2022 was hugely significant for the sectors. My Department’s demonstrated support underlines the commitment of the Government to supporting these sectors and how much we valued these sectors through the pandemic. As we emerged from the pandemic, in budget 2023, thankfully, there was no longer a need for the scale of intervention in respect of Covid-19 that was required in 2022 because the restrictions had been lifted. However, the sectors supported by my Department are not completely recovered from the impact of the pandemic and therefore there is an ongoing need to support the sectors as they seek to fully recover. Accordingly, the 2023 budget for my Department contains some once-off funding of approximately €98 million, not as much as was required in 2022 for the reasons I have outlined, but still quite a significant amount. Hence, there is an overall fall in the total budget for 2023 compared with 2022 caused by the reduction in overall once-off funding of €121 million. Overall, the reduction year on year on the face of the budget is due mainly to the reduction in once-off funding from €219 million to €98 million.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would point out that even though it has reduced from 2022 to 2023, before I was Minister the Revised Estimate, REV, gross total for the Department was €802 million, whereas even given the reduction in the last 12 months, the 2023 gross Revised Estimate is €1.166 billion, so it is still a significant increase in the last three years of this Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Some €15 million in additional funding has been secured for overseas marketing of Ireland. The budget always contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including investments in skills development and retention of €3 million, and a €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have also secured additional long-term funding for the hosting of the American college football classic every August out to 2026. This will provide a strong boost to the sector in 2023 and we would expect 40,000 overseas visitors for this years Notre Dame versus Navy game. There is also additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Of course, there are other allocations of €36.5 million for tourism product development. We have the basic income for the arts and that €35 million is secured to support 2,000 artists in that pilot scheme. We have €30.2 million for culture infrastructure and development, €11.5 million for the newly extended Creative Ireland programme, €7 million for artists’ spaces and climate adaptation measures and, of course, €6.6 million in funding for Culture Ireland, which is an increase of €2 million on the 2022 allocation. The list is quite extensive and I can get the Deputy more detail if he wishes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The 2022 budget was cast at a time when the impact of Covid was devastating for the sector. On the face of it, as I noted earlier, the budget for tourism has fallen from €290 million to €231 million, a drop of €59 million. Of course, there was the €50 million for business continuity supports which Fáilte Ireland distributed but they were not needed because, thankfully, the Covid pandemic restrictions were lifted.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Deputy mean delivery of actual projects in 2022?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We might come back to the Deputy on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Those water-based Platforms for Growth initiatives that were announced will be going to planning now. Mount Congreve Gardens will open in March and I hope to be down there for that. I was at Knowth and Brú na Bóinne, which opened in 2022, the Blasket Islands centre opened in 2022, the Céide Fields opened in 2022, and the National Famine Museum was another that I opened last year. That amazing treetop walk at Avondale House and Forest Park opened in July 2022 and the Patrick Kavanagh Centre experience is another one that I opened in 2022, and the Chair, Deputy Niamh Smyth, was at that. Johnstown Castle, Kilkenny Riverside Gardens and the Shackleton Gardens were in 2021, but we can see there is quite a list for 2022, and I was quite busy opening various places around the country. That is good for tourism. There is one in the Deputy’s constituency, the Mary Robinson Centre and presidential library in Ballina. In 2016, my Department awarded a grant of €2 million towards the cost of construction and fit-out of the Mary Robinson Centre. Mayo County Council is the project promoter and procured development funding of over €5 million for that project. Mayo County Council has advised my Department that the project is on track for opening to the public in the summer of this year.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Between now and the end of March, I believe 224 contracts will come up for review, but it is the Department of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, that will be dealing with this matter. We do not yet have a line of sight on this issue but we keep in close contact with that Department for obvious reasons. My Department officials are on the senior officials group which deals with these issues.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Between now and the end of March, 224 contracts will come up for review.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We also have to consider that much of our tourism is outside the capital. Much of that industry supports 260,000 jobs. It is one of the most important and significant employers of indigenous industry in the country. I have sought the extension of the lower VAT rate for tourism but, ultimately, that is a decision for the Minister for Finance. As the Deputy knows, all supports needed for the cost-of-living crisis, which was possibly not as significant a feature for this industry last summer as it is now, are currently being reviewed. Any decision made on that will be in the context of the wider supports needed for society. Decisions will be made on that in the coming weeks. I sit on the Cabinet sub-committee that will be briefed on that in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My main concern and priority as Minister is that last year cannot be seen as a true reflection. It was a very successful year for tourism. It was much better than we imagined but it cannot be seen as the baseline. I am conscious, having met with industry representatives, including the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation and from co-chairing a meeting of the hospitality and tourism forum last week, that there are concerns about what 2023 will look like and the reality of the immense cost of living and cost of maintaining businesses for hotels. As regards the VAT rate, we have to remain competitive to attract tourists from other EU countries. That is why I seek that VAT rate. However, as I said, this will be a whole-of-government approach. It may be something I am seeking but we have to look at the wider supports.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The VAT rate is for us to remain competitive. If we went back up to-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I said during our previous discussion on this issue that in my engagement with the sector I always stressed that the emphasis must be on value for money in order that tourists will return. The vast majority of hotels did not charge excessively. Sometimes, there is an awful lot of emphasis on cities, and not on rural Ireland and the value of the industry in supporting employment there. I have a broader focus on supporting a sector that, as I said, supports more than 250,000 jobs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The €11.5 million carryover is for sports capital and the €6.5 million carryover is for cultural infrastructure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----is for cultural infrastructure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is taking time to progress them. It is to aid the progress of those projects.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is for national cultural institution projects. There is a range of projects under national cultural institutions capital development.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Under just transition funding, the tourism end of the plan includes allocations of €38 million under the regenerative tourism business supports and €30 million for the tourism trails network. Under strand 1, the midlands trails network will receive €30 million funding. That is a strategic network of trails to interconnect with the existing arterial greenway network. This is infrastructure for walking, cycling and water-based trails. Strand 2 covers amenity supports for businesses. This is a fund of €25 million. It is to support public, private and community based tourism enterprises to support and expand existing regenerative and sustainable tourism infrastructure. This will help local economies. Strand 3 covers alternative low-carbon accommodation and amounts to €3 million. This is for carbon-neutral and low-carbon small-scale developments at key strategic locations aligned to the trails network in strand 1.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. Strand 4 covers smart solution development which has funding of €10 million. This is a programme of hard and soft supports to help deliver smart technology and digital solutions. It is for commercial digital experiences for visitors, prioritising the potential to be green. With regard to Fáilte Ireland Deputy Dillon asked what are the key indicators. They are what we see in delivery. Deputy Munster is probably familiar with Knowth, which opened last year, as did the Blasket Island centre, the Céide Fields, the National Famine Museum in Strokestown, the treetop walk at Avondale House and the Patrick Kavanagh visitor centre experience, which is located not too far from Deputy Munster. I had the pleasure of returning home to open that. Looking at what was delivered is the best way to assess it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The proposed registration of short-term tourist letting Bill will not change existing planning permission requirements regarding short-term lets. The planning permission side is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I know this is an issue that was raised with officials from that Department by members of this committee. The main issue seemed to be around the need for clear planning guidance to ensure that the short-term lets are dealt with sensibly, in particular in rural areas. That is what Deputy O'Sullivan is indicating in what he has shared with me. That is also what the Department of the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, is cognisant of. The Department gave a commitment that it would issue new planning guidelines to planning authorities to assist them in adopting a sensible approach. I am very cognisant of what the Deputy says about rural areas. On engagement, when the general scheme of the registration of short-term tourist letting Bill was published before Christmas, briefings were held with the key tourism stakeholders and major online platforms. Since then, Fáilte Ireland has arranged more than 30 briefings. My Department met with the Irish Self Catering Federation last week. The focus of that meeting was the federation's concerns regarding the planning regulations for short-term letting. It is something that was also raised with me and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, when we co-chaired the tourism and hospitality forum last week. My Department is committed to convening a round-table meeting with key stakeholders next week, which will include the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Why were amendments Nos. 5 and 6 ruled out of order?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 which have been grouped are about addressing the situation where a school is being provided in a new development but the roads leading to it have not been taken in charge. That leads to the problem that school traffic wardens cannot be provided to ensure the safety of students. This issue came up in Belmayne where a child was recently knocked down. The amendment would address that issue by adding roads which it is intended to take in charge. That is what I am trying to do. Amendment No. 5 would allow local authorities to provide school traffic wardens to ensure the safety of children at Luas and other railway line crossings. The Minister is aware of the situation for the constituents we share in Rathdown. There is a huge safety issue at Windy Arbour Luas stop which is near Our Lady's of Clonskeagh. Recently a national school child ran out onto the line. The local authority cannot provide a school traffic warden there because it is not on its land. The amendment would address the issue simply by adding to "places where schoolchildren cross public roads" the words "or railways". It is my intention to move the amendments again on Report Stage. Is the Minister willing to reconsider them?
